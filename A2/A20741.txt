A Preface concerning the Apostasy of the now Church of Rome.
THis ensuing Treatise, as it clears the Doctrine of the Gospel in that high
point concerning our title to the Kingdom of Heaven: so it helps to discover
the Apostasy of the now Church of Rome from the faith. For though the Papists
do vaunt that their Church, meaning especially the Sea of Rome, is so far
from falling away from the faith, that it cannot fall into errors in matters
of faith: yet they cannot deny, but that in the latter times, In novissimis
^emporib. i. reg^ance Antichrist. Ansel^. in 1 Timothy 4. 1. Vid. Diatrib. de
Anti^h. and part. 1. l. 3. c. 1.. 3.
and namely in the time of Antichrist, there should be a great defection from
the faith, and as it were a Catholic Apostasy, whereof Antichrist was to be
the head. Of this Apostasy the holy Ghost has prophesied in diverse places of
the Scriptures, as, 1 Timothy 4. 1. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 3. Mat. 24. 24. Apoc. 13. 12, 14,
15, 16. And has also set down the notes and marks whereby they may be
known who make this Apostasy from the faith:

As 1. 1 Timothy 4. 1. 3.
to forbid marriage, 2 To command abstinence from meats, both of them for
religion and conscience sake. 3 Idolatry, for that is by spiritual fornication
to fall from God. Psalm. 73. 27. Hos. 1. 2. 9. 1. which by the Septuagint is
thus expressed, Hos. 4. 12. (...). 4. Ostentation of miracles, the proper badge
of the Antichristian Apostasy in these latter times, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 9. Mar. 24.
24. Apoc. 13. 14.
All which notes I have proved in my Latin Treatise of Antichrist, properly to
agree to the now Church of Rome, the forbidding of marriage, and commanding
abstinence from meats, part. 1. lib. 3. cap. 2. and 3. Idolatry, ibid. cap.
3.. 5. Miracles, lib. 6. cap. 1.. 5. whereby it is evident, that the new Church
of Rome, has made this Apostasy. Now let us consider, in what respects the
Church of Rome is revolted from the faith. By faith in this question we
understand, not the habit or grace of faith, but the Doctrine of faith, Non id
quo creditur, This distinction is propounded by S. Augustine, de Trinit. lib.
13. c. 2. and by the master of the sentences. Sent. 3. did. 23.
not that by which we believe, sed illud quod creditur, bu^ that which we do
believe. In which sense the word faith is often used both in the Scriptures,
and also in the monuments of Ecclesiastical writers. Now the Doctrine of faith
is either general or special. The general are the whole canonical
Scriptures, or the written Word of God in general, which is objectum fidei
adaequatum, the even object, the rule and foundation of faith: so that
whatsoever doctrine is contained in the Scriptures either expressly, or by
necessary consequence, is to be received as a doctrine of faith, and
whatsoever is not so contained in the Scriptures, is not dogma fidei.

From the holy Scriptures, which God has propounded to be the only rule of
faith, they are revolted unto the doctrines and devices of men, by changing the
rule of faith; which they have done diverse ways. For first, whereas the rule,
the foundation, and chief principle of faith whereinto it is last resolved, is
the authority of God speaking in the holy Scriptures; they have set up another
rule, which is the authority of the Roman Church, and therein of the Pope;
which they make the superior Vid. Diatrib. de Antichristo. lib. 4. c. 6. and 7.
rule, from which the authority of the Scriptures themselves depends, and
into which their faith is last resolved. For the Pope is, as they say,
virtually the Church, and what they say in this kind to magnify the authority
of the Church, is specially to be under stood of the Pope, who only for sooth
has an infallible judgment, and not subject to error, for, if you will
believe them, a general or oecumenicall Council without the Pope may err,
but the Pope alone without a Council cannot err: yea, the authority of the
Pope and Council together, is no greater than the authority of the Pope alone,
from whom all Councels have their authority, for ab arbi^ pontificis tota Idem
l. 3. 6. 49.
conciliorum authoritas pendet, quae tantam habent, quantam Papa indulget, and
thus Bellarmine De ^ont. Romans lib. 4. cap. 3.
denies this assertion, aliquid majus est concilium cum pontifice, quam
pontifex solus. If therefore the authority of the Church be greater than that
of the Scriptures, as they teach, and if the authority of the Pope be
absolutely above the Church universal, as Bellar. de Council. li. 2. c. 17.
Conc. Trid. sess 4. Pari pietatis affectu and reverentia suscipiunt ei
venerantur.
they also teach: then much more is the authority of the Pope above the
Scriptures. Now whosoever takes upon him authority above the Scriptures, which
are the undoubted Word of God, he is undoubtedly Antichrist; whose judgment
to make (as the Papists plainly do) the chief principle of faith, into which
their faith is last resolved, is no better th^n to revoli from Christ to
Antichrist.

Secondly, they change the rule of faith, by making their traditions, that is,
such doctrines and observations as are taught and observed in the Church of
Rome, having no ground nor warrant in the holy Scriptures, to be the Word of
God, the word unwritten, and a rule of faith: which also they do not only
match with the holy Scriptures, but even in many respects prefer before
Cesteri Enchirid. cap. 1. Hutus praestantia multis par tib. ^peral Scripturas.
them, and acknowledge them to be the more Cesler* ibid.
entire and perfect rule of faith.

Thirdly, they have changed the rule of faith, by making those books
canonical, which all antiquity almost, yea, and all succeeding ages until the
Council of Trent; following therein the judgment of Hierome, did hold
Apochryphall, or at the most but Eeclesiasticall; which might be read in the
Church for moral instruction, but not as rules of faith.

Fourthly, they change the rule of faith, when in stead of the original Text
of the old and new Testaments, which were penned by the Prophets and Apostles
themselves, they make a corrupt, and that sometimes a barbarous translation of
I know not whom, to be the authentike text, and the rule of faith; preferring
the vulgar Latin translation before the original text, which the penmen of
the holy Ghost did write.

Fifthly, they change the rule of faith, when in stead o^ the true sense and
m^aning of the holy Scriptures expounded by the Scriptures according to the
analog^e of faith, they obtrude the sense given by the Church of Rome, and
therein by the Pope, who is, as they say, the supreme and only authentical
interpreter of the Word, from whom it is not lawful to dissent: So that in his
sense any portion of the Scriptures, though obscure, must be acknowledged the
word of God; but urged in any other sense, it is the word Hosius de expresso
Dei verbo.
of the Devil rather than the Word of God. Now it is the sense of the
Scriptures, which is the Word of God rather than the letter, the sense being
the soul and life of the letter. Non enim in legendo Scripturae, sed in
intelligendo consistunt, says Hierome, Contr. Luciferian. and in Gal. 1. neque
enim in Scripturarum verbis, Evangelium est, sed in sensu
The words, says Bellarmine, De verbo non scripto. l. 4. c. 4.
are as the sheath, the sense is the sword of the Spirit.

Thus has the Church of Rome revolted from the general doctrine of faith,
which is the written word of God, or the holy Canonical Scriptures.

The special doctrines of faith are the several articles taught in the
Scriptures; which are the special objects of faith, either quae justificat
only, or qua justificat. The justifying faith belee^h all the articles and
doctrines of faith which are taught in the Word of God, but the peculiar object
of faith, quatenus justificat, is the doctrine of the Gospel.

As touching the special doctrines of Christian faith, there are diverse
bundreds of errors wherein the Church of Rome has revolted from the faith, not
at once, but at dive^s times and by degrees. The number whereof is so great, as
that Popery, or the Catholicisme of Papi^ts may justly be called the Catholic
Apostasy.

But from the peculiar doctrine of faith, quatenus justificat, which is the
doctrine of the Gospel concerning justification by faith in Christ alone, the
Church of Rome chiefly erreth, as I have showed in this Treatise; and by their
Antichristian doctrine in this point they are revolted from the Gospel, which
is Romans 10. 8.
Verbum fidei, the Word or Doctrine of faith, they are fallen from the
comfortable doctrine of this grace, and to them Christ is made of none effect,
as I have See lib. 7. c. 3.. 9, 10, 11, 12.
proved.

This assertion concerning the Apost^sie of the now Church of Rome, I ^ppose as
an antidote against the poison of their impudently depraved article concerning
the Catholic Church, wherein there is a double imposture or poyso^, both in
respect of the object, and also of the act of faith; which two in every article
of the Creed are to be considered. For first, in respect of the object, whereas
the Apostles Creed has The holy Catholic Church, they understand the
Catholic Roman See the learned work called the Grand imposture.
Church, the mother, for so^th, and mistress of all Churches; which they call
^atholike, not as it is one particular Church, as every Orthodox Church was
wont to be called, as the Catholic Church of Apud Eusebius. lib. 4* cap. 15.
Smyrna, etc. but as it comprehends all particular Churches which live in
Communion with, and in subjection to the Sea of Rome, all which are, as they
say, but one Church, because they are subject to one visible head the Pope of
Rome. And they add that out of this communion with the Sea of Rome, and
without this subjection to the Pope of Rome, as the universal Bishop, there is
no salvation. With this one not they co^y-catch those seduced souls, which
either they draw to their side, or detain in Communion with them. Howheit, it
is a most shameless imposture.

For first, can it be imagined, that the Apostles by Catholic understood the
Roman Church, which, when they composed the Creed, was not extant, nor for
diverse years after. No doubt the Apostles meant that Church which then had a
being, and whereof themselves were members, which also had been from the
beginning of the world, and was to continue for ever, viz. the universal
company of the Elect: and that is the meaning of the word Catholic.

Secondly for the first six hundred years the Bishop of Rome did not
challenge unto hims^lse the Title or authority of universal Bishop, but was
only the Archbishop or Patriarch of Rome, unto whom the four other
Patriarchs of Constantinople, Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem, were no more
subject, than he to them, every one of them having the primacy within their
several Patriarchicall jurisdictions. And although after the grant of the
Tyrant Phocas in the year six hundred seven, the Pope challenged for himself
to be the universal Bishop, and for his See to be the head of all Churches:
yet by the Greek, and other Churches, which were, and are the better and
greater part of Christendom, this claim never was, nor is at this day
acknowledged. All which Churches notwithstanding wherein were innumerable
Saints and Martyrs, and the most holy Fathe^s of the Church, by this Romish
article are most wic^edly and schi^matically excluded from Salvation, because
they acknowledged no subjection to the Sea of Rome. But if the now Church of
Rome be the Apostaticall Church, having revolted from the ancient Religion of
Christians by their id^latry, will worship, and supers^ition, and from the
Ancien^ faith of Christians contained generally in the holy Canonical
Scriptures, and more particularly in the Gospel, as by other almost
innumerable errors of Popery, so more especially by those which I confute in
this book: and if the head of this Catholic Apostasy, that is to say, the
Pope, be Antichrist; then let all Christians, who have any care of their
souls, consider, whether it be safe for them to live in the Communion of that
Sect, and in subjection to that See, where they must have the apostaticall
Church, even the whore of Babylon to be their mother, from whom they are
commanded to separate, Apoc. 18. 4. and the Antichrist to be their father,
their head, their universal Bishop, who prevails in them only that perish,
2 These. 2. 10.

2. As touching the act of faith, their coozenage in respect thereof is worse,
if worse may be. For where the Apostles Creed has Credo sanctam Ecclesiam
Catholicam, they understand this article, as if the words were not, Credo
Ecclesiam, I believe that there is a Catholic Church, and that there is a
Communion of Saints the members of that Church, etc, but credo Ecclesiae, or in
Ecclesiam, I give credit to the Church, or I believe in the Church, making the
Church (whereby they understand the now Church of Rome) not only the
material, but also formal object of faith, in which they believe, and for
which they believe whatsoever it believes, or propounds to be believed. And
in this exposition they are grown so impudent, as that they say, Gerdon.
contrv. 1. c. 27.
that the Church Catholic, (meaning the now Roman Church) is the very
principle of our faith for which we are to believe the holy Scriptures, and all
other articles; that it is the chief pri^ciple, whereon the authority of the
Scriptures depends, and the last principle into which their faith is to be
resolved: that Ibid.
in this article is summarily contained the whole Word of God, not only
written, but also unwritten: that Christ propounded unto us the whole Word of
God, when he commanded us to hear the Church, Mat. 18. 17. Luke 10. 16. and
(which surpasses all impudency) that the Fathers Ibid. ^. 3.
sometimes in this sense do say, that all the doctrines of faith are contained
in the holy Scriptures, to wit, as in a general principle, quatenus illae
monent credendum esse Ecclesiae, in that they admonish that the Church is to be
b^leeved in all things. And further that the implicit faith, which is implied
in this one article, I believe the Roman Church, and wh^tsoever that Church
believes, or propounds to be believed, is the most Hosius de authorit.
Scripturae. lib. 3.
entire faith and most safe, not only for the lay people, though they know or
believe no more, but also for the learned. For whom it is not so safe, when
Satan contendeth with them, to defend their faith by the Scriptures, as to
profess only that they believe as the Church believes.

But indeed this implicit faith, whereby men do believe or profess
themselves to believe as the Church of Rome, and therein the Pope believes or
propounds to be beleev^d acknowledging him to be the principle, yea the
chief, and last principle into which there is ultima resolutio fidei, upon
which the authority of the Scriptures depends, is to take upon them the very
mark of the beast, Vid. Diatrib. de Antichristo. part. 1. lib. 6. c. 4.. 9.
and to revolt from Christ to Antichrist: which is the miserable condition of
all resolute Papists. For Antichrist prevails in them only that perish, whose
names are not written in the book of life. See Mat. 24. 24. 2 Thessalonians. 2. 10.
Apoc. 14. 9, 10, 11. and 17. 8.

Let not therefore the popish priests and Jesuits, the Emissaries of
Antichrist, like egregious imposters terrify any longer the people with these
bug-beares, that there is no salvation but in the communion with the Church of
Rome, and in subjection under the Pope; until they have proved, which they
will never be able to do, that their Church is not Apostaticall, and that
their Pope, who is the head of the Catholic Apostasy, is not, as about twelve
years ago^ I proved him to be, Antichrist. To conclude, let the popish Rabbis
either vindicate their Church from Apostasy, and their Pope from
Antichristianisme, or else for ever hereafter hold their peace.

A TREATISE OF JUSTIFICATION.
THE FIRST BOOK, Wherein is set down the true doctrine of Justification
according to the word of God.
CAP. I. The excellency of this argument is set forth, and the definition of
justification propounded, and in part expounded.
. I.

AMong all the articles of Christian religion there The excellency of this
argument.
is none, as I suppose, either more necessary to be known, or more
comfortable to be believed, than the doctrine of justification: whereby a
faithful man is taught to believe and know, that he being a sinner in
himself, and by sin obnoxious to eternal damnation; is by the mercies of
God, and merits of Christ through faith, not only freed from the guilt of his
sins and from everlasting damnation, but also accepted as righteous before
God in Christ, and made heir of eternal life. This doctrine in many places of
the Scripture Lib. 6. Cap. 6.. 2.
hereafter* to be cited, is (...), by way of excellency called the truth John
1. 17.
, and sometimes the truth of the Gospel Gal. 2. 5.
, as Gal. 2. 5. that is, the truth of God revealed in the Gospel concerning
justification and salvation by the free grace of God, through the merits of
Christ apprehended by faith; being also the chief argument contained in the
Gospel, which is therefore called the power of Romans 1. 16, 17.
God unto salvation, because therein the Righteousness of God, even that by
which we are justified and saved, is revealed from faith to faith; as it is
written, The just shall live by faith, or he that is just by faith shall live:
which doctrine is so inviolably and incorruptly to be held, Gal. 1. 6. 8.
that if an Apostle, if an Angel from heaven shall teach any other Gospel,
that is, any other doctrine whereby to be justified and saved, than by the
only merits of Christ apprehended by faith, he ought to be held accursed.
But by how much the more necessary and comfortable this doctrine is: by so much
the more it is oppugned by Satan; who as at the first, he did not abide in the
truth, John 8. 44.
nor kept his first estate, but left his habitation rather Jude 6.
than he would (as some probably think) embrace this truth, namely that the
second Person in Trinity should for the salvation of mankind become flesh, and
that in him the nature of man should be advanced above the nature of Angels: so
has he ever since opposed it by all means, as namely by raising, not only
other false teachers in the apostles times and since, but even Antichrist and
his adherents in these later times, who have not only perverted this doctrine,
but also subverted it, and have as it were, taken away the subject of the
question: for by confounding the law and the Gospel, the covenant of works
and the covenant of grace, the benefits of justification and sanctification,
and of two making but one; they have wholly abolished that great benefit of the
Messiah about our justification, whereby we are freed from hell, and entitled
to the kingdom of heaven, and consequently they are fallen Gal. 5. 4.
from grace, having disanulled Gal. 3. 17, 18.
the covenant of grace, and made the promise of none effect. For whosoever
seeks to be justified by inherent i Romans 4. 14.
righteousness, he is under Gal. 3. 10.
the curse, he is a debtour Gal. 5. 2, 3, 4. Gal. 2. 21.
to the whole law, and therefore to him Christ is become of none Of this see
more, lib. 7. c. 3.. 10, 11, 12.
effect. This being therefore a controversy of such importance, that it
concerns our very title to the kingdom of heaven, it is to be handled with
all diligence, and not without invocation of the holy Spirit of truth; whom we
beseech to guide and to direct us in setting down the truth, to confirm and
stablish us in the profession of it, and to assist and strengthen us against
the enemies thereof. But before I come to confute the errors of the Papists,
the enemies of the truth; I will first set down the true doctrine of
justification according to Gods word.

. II. Justification therefore is a most gracious and righteous action of The
definition of Justification.
God, whereby he imputing the righteousness of Christ to a believing sinner,
absolveth him from his sins, and accepts* of him as righteous in Christ,
and as (...) heir of eternal life, to the praise and glory of his own mercy
and justice. Where first consider the name of the thing, which we have The
name.
now defined, and are hereafter to handle. To justify, if you respect the ^
Justificar^.
notation of the Latin word, signifies to make just, as to magnify,
imports to make great. Neither is it to be doubted, but that the Lord, whom
he justifies, does constitute or make just. Now the Lord makes men just two
ways; either by imputation of Christ's righteousness, which is out of them in
Christ, as being his personal righteousness: or by infusion of
righteousness, as it were, by influence into them from Christ their head. To
the faithful therefore there belongs a twofold righteousness; the one of
justification, the other of sanctification. The former is the righteousness of
Christ, and therefore the righteousness of God, as it is often called, the
righteousness of God; because it is the righteousness of him that is God, and
is imputed to the believer: the later is ours, because inherent in us, though
received from God, as all our good things are. The former is perfect, as being
the righteousness of him that is God: the later is but begun in this life, and
is to be perfected in the life to come. By the former we are justified, by the
later we are sanctified. If it be objected, that there seems little or no
difference between these two words: for as to justify is to make just, so to
sanctify is to make holy. And therefore as to sanctify, is to make holy by
holiness infused: so to justify, is to make just by justice inherent.

I answer, First, that this is contrary to the use of the word justify* not
only pe^petuall in the Scriptures, but also ordinary in the speeches and
writings of men. Wherein God is said to justify men, and man is said to
justify God, and one man is said to justify another, and one and the same man
to justify himself without any signification of infusing righteousness into
him, but by clearing him and pronouncing him just. Secondly, that there is no
further respect to be had in this controversy to the notation of the Latin or
English word, than as it is a true translation of the Hebrew word in the old
Testament, and of the Greek in the new: now I shall make it evident, Lib. 2.
that the Hebrew hitsdiq, and so the greek (...) is Verbum forens^, a
judicial word taken from the courts of justice* which being attributed to the
Judge, is opposed to condemning, and signifies to absolve, or to give sentence
with the party questioned.

. III. In the definition we consider justification, as an action of The
definition of Justification explaned. 1. That it is an action of God, Romans 8.
33. Esaias 43. 25.
God, whose alone work it is; and so the Scriptures consider it in many
places, as Romans 8. 33. It is God that does justify, for it is he only that
forgiveth sins, Esa. 43. 25. It is he only that can by making us righteous
in Christ, give us right and title to the kingdom of heaven. It is no action
therefore of our own, or of any creature, neither is it wrought by our own
preparations and dispositions. For although every man is bound to use all
means to attain to justification; yet it is not of him that wills, Romans 9.
16.
nor of him that runs, but of God that shows mercy. For if God be the
agent in justifying us, then are we the patients. And for that cause we are
never in the Scriptures exhorted to justification, or to the parts thereof
(which are not our Officia or duties, but Gods Beneficia) as we are to the
duties of sanctification, whereunto we being already justified and regenerated,
do cooperate with the Spir^t of grace.

. IIII. Secondly, when we say it is an action of God, Imputing 2. An action of
God without us.
the righteousness of Christ and absolving the believing sinner, and accepting
him, etc. we consider it not as an action of God within us working a positive
or real change as in sanctification, but as an action of God without us. For
it is a judicial act of God, as the Judge oppo^ed to condemning. And therefore
as by his sentence he does condemn, that is, make wicked; so by his sentence
he does justify, that is, of guilty he makes not guilty, (...), by his
sentence God does justify, as Chrysostom and Oecumenius note upon Romans 8. 33.
where a judicial proceeding in the business of justification is plainly
described. For there is mention of the accuser of Gods elect, there is God that
justifies, and none to condemn, there is the advocate and intercessor Verse
34.
to plead for us. And as in condemning, though the hebrew word Hirshiah opposed
to justifying, signifies to make wicked (for as Tsady is to be just, and
Hitsdiq to make just, that is, to justify; so Rashah to be wicked, and
Hirshiah to make wicked, that is, to condemn) yet God by condemning does not
make a real or positive change by infusion of wickedness into the party whom
by his sentence he makes wicked, that is, condemns: so in justifying,
though the word do signify to make righteous, yet the Lord does not, Quatenus
justificat, as he justifies, work a real or positive mutation in the party,
whom by his sentence he makes just, that is, justifies, in respect of any
inward dispositions or qualities, but only a relative change or mutation in
respect of his estate and condition before God, and in respect of some
relations to him. It is true, that in our justification we are of sinners made
righteous; but the righteousness which we have by justification stands in
remission of sin, and acceptance or constitution of us as righteous, not in
our selves, but in Christ: both which are wrought by imputation of his
righteousness. It is true also, that whom God does justify, he does also
sanctify. But in justification he does not work a real change in the party,
as he does in sanctification. And this (...) in the like actions of God, viz.
adoption, redemption, and reconciliation, which three in substance differ not
from justification. For all agree in the not imputing of sin Ephesians. 1. 7.
Col. 1. 14. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Romans 4. 5, 7.
by imputation of Christ's righteousness, but are diversified by certain
relations: all which concur in justification, that men having their sins
forgiven, whereby they had been either the children of the devil, by adoption
are made the sons of God; or the vassals and bondslaves of sin and Satan,
are by redemption made the servants of God; or enemies to God, by their
reconciliation become his favorites; or guilty of sin and damnation, in
their justification they are accepted as righteous in Christ* and consequently
become Gods servants, Gods favorites, Gods sons; and if sons then also
heirs of eternal life. As therefore in adoption, redemption, reconciliation,
there is no real change made in the party, but only a new relation acquired,
of being a son and h^ire to the adoptour, a servant to the redeemer, a
favorite to the reconciler, which before he was not: so neither in
justification is there a real or positive change (as the Papists would have
it) but (...) relative, or (...), that is, in relation, in respect of those
relations even now mentioned; and in respect of his estat^ and condition before
God; being in his justification translated from the estate of damnation, unto
the state of salvation. Even as the council of Trent, it self defines Sess.
6. cap. 4. Vt sit translatio ab eo statu in quo homo nascitur silius primi
Adami in statum grati^ and adoptionis filiorum Dei per secun* dum Adamum Jesum
Christum salvatorem nostrum.
justification to be a translation from that state wherein a man is borne the
son of the first Adam, into a state of grace and adoption of Gods sons,
through the second Adam Jesus Christ our Savior, which is done without any
real change wrought in the party as he is justified. For who before was
guilty of sin and damnation: the same man remaining a sinner in himself, and
in himself worthy of damnation, is in his justification absolved from the
guilt of sin, and accepted as r^teous in Christ, in whom also he is made a
servant, a favorite, a son of God, and consequently (as I said in the
definition) an heir of eternal life.

. V. And yet we deny not, but that those whom God reconcileth Justification
though it always concurreth with Gods gracious actions within us, yet it is
carefully to be distinguished from them.
unto himself, receiving them into his grace and ^avour in Christ, them also
he endueth in some measure with the graces of his Spirit: whom he adopteth to
be his sons in Christ, them also he regenerateth by his holy Spirit: whom he
redeemeth from the guilt of sin, he also freeth from the dominion of sin:
and whom he justifies by faith, he also sanctifies by his Spirit, that is,
whom he makes just by imputation, them also he makes just by infusion of
righteousness: to whom he imputes the merit of Christ his death and
resurrection apprehended by faith, to them also he applies the virtue and
efficacy of Christ's death and resurrection, both to mortify sin in them,
and to raise them up to newness of life. By this doctrine we may try our
selves whether we be reconciled, redeemed, adopted, justified. For hereby it
shall appear, that God has received us into his grace, if he has also endued
us with his grace. Chasidim, as they are called in the Scriptures, the
favorites of God, are usually translated his holy ones, and all the faithful,
even in this life, are termed Saints. Hereby it will appear, that we are
redeemed from the guilt of sin, if we be also freed from the dominion of
sin. Hereby it will appear, that we are adopted, if (...) be also
regeneratech Hereby it will appear, that we are justified, if we ^e also in
some measure sanctified. But yet, howsoever these graces ^waies go together,
and cannot be severed: yet must we carefully distinguish betwixt the grace of
God which is in himself, and his graces which are in us; betwixt the actions
of Gods grace without us, and the actions of his grace within us. Wherefore,
though adoption and regeneration, though receiving into grace and enduing with
grace, though redeeming from the guilt and purging in some measure from the
corruption of sin, though justification and sanctification are always
unseparable companions: yet we may not with the Papists confound them, and so
place the matter of justification, and merit of salvation in our selves, as
they wickedly do; but we are religiously to distinguish them, as they are in
themselves truly and really distinguished, to the praise of the glory, that is,
the glorious praise of his grace, not of that which is in us, but of that which
is in himself, whereby he has graciously accepted us in his beloved, Ephesians.

. VI. Thirdly, when we say it is an action of God imputing to a believing
Justification an action of God continued.
sinner, etc. We consider it, not as a sudden and momentany action, which is
of no continuance, as if all our sins both past, present, and to come are
remitted in an instant; but as an act of God continued from our vocation,
wherein the grace of faith is begotten in us, to our glorification, which is
the end of our faith. For as this action of God is called the justification of
a sinner; so, whiles we continue sinners, we have still need to be justified.
And as we always have sin in this life: so, that it may not be imputed, we
have need, that Christ's righteousness should be imputed unto us: and that as
we sin daily, so Christ our advocate should continually make Heb. 7. 25.
intercession for us: that notwithstanding our manifold slippes, whereinto
through humane frailety we fall; and notwithstanding those manifold infirmities
and corruptions, which remain in us as the relikes of original sin, we may
be continued in the grace and favor of God, by the continued imputation of
Christ's righteousness, obtained by his continual intercession for us. For
therefore does he continue his intercession for us, that our justification may
be continued to us: and that as we sin daily, so we may daily seek and
obtain pardon. But if justification should so be wrought once and at once, as
that after that act wrought in an instance, we should no more be justified, nor
no more need remission of sin; then must we erroniously conceive, that the
sins which after the first moment of our justification we do commit, are
actually remitted before they be committed; whereas God forgiveth only sins
past, Romans 3. 25. So shall we not only set open a gap to all licentiousness
Romans 3. 25.
(for who will so fear to commit sin as he ought, or when he has committed
it, so sue for the pardon thereof, who is persuaded beforehand that it is
already remitted) but also shall open the mouths of our adversaries, who will
be ready to say, that we Protestants ought not to pray for remission of sin,
because in our opinion (as they say) we need it not: but to this calumniation
of the Papist I have elsewhere The Covenant of Grace. Chap. 8. page 109.
Whether Justification be wrought but once and at once.
answered.

. VII. If it be said, that it is a received opinion among many, that
justificatio simul and semel fit, that justification is wrought at once, and
but once: I answer, that that assertion is not to be admitted without
distinction, nor without good caution. The distinction is this: that there is a
justification of a sinner before God in (...) coelesti, which properly is
called justification, and is that, which here I have defined: and there is a
justification whereby a man already justified before God, is justified in foro
conscienti^, in the court of his own conscience: which is not properly
justification it self, but the assurance of it. To this latter that assertion
of but once and at once cannot in any good sense, be applied. For neither is
the full assurance of our justification attained at once, but by degrees,
wherein we are to labor and to give diligence to make, as our election and
calling, so also our justification more and more sure unto us. Neither is it
given but once. For by committing of any crime or any grievous sin, by
spiritual desertions, by the ^orcible temptations of Satan, this act of
spiritual faith, which we call assurance, may be interrupted or lost for a
time; and yet by repentance, by prayer and practice of piety it may be
recovered again; and therefore not given but once. To the former indeed it may
be applied in both parts, but with a twofold caution: first, in respect of
simul, at once, if it be understood as excluding degrees, and not continuance.
Namely, that we are not justified by degrees, and as it were by little and
little, as though our justification were not perfect at the first. For no
sooner does a man truly believe in Christ, but the righteousness of Christ is
imputed to him, and in and by that righteousness he stands righteous before
God, as well at the first, as at the last; that righteousness of Christ, by
which he is justified, whether first, or last, being most perfect. Therefore
the righteousness of justification cannot be increased, neither does our
justification before God admit degrees, either in one and the same person, or
yet in diverse men: howsoever the assurance of justification, and the work of
sanctification, whereby we are to be renewed in the inner a Cor. 4. 16.
man day by day have degrees, according to the degrees of our faith, and
according to the measure of grace received. Secondly, when it is said that we
are justified before God semel, but once, that also may be admitted, if by once
be meant one continual act. For as we are regenerated but once, because ut
semel nascimur, ita semel renascimur: so faith, which is wrought in our
regeneration is given but once. For that which Saint Jude says, verse 3. of
faith once given, is no less true of the habit, than of the doctrine of faith;
which habit, being once had, is never utterly lost. For all they who have true
faith, are borne of God, 1 John 5. 1. John 1. 12, 13. And those 1 John 5. 1.
John 1. 12, 13.
who are once borne of God are never unborne again; but being made sons by
faith, as all the faithful are, Gal. 3. 26. they are also made Gal. 3. 2^.
Romans 8. 17.
heirs of God, and coheires with Christ, Romans 8. 17. As faith therefore is
never utterly lost, no more is justification. For so long as we have faith, so
long we are justified. But the habit of faith we never lose, though perhaps
some act of faith may sometimes be interrupted. Therefore our justification is
but one continued act, and in that sense we are justified but once.

. VIII. Now, whereas we have defined and defended according The Papists
confuted, who deny it either to be an action of God, or an action without us,
or continued.
to the Scriptures, that justification is an action of God, and such an action
as is without us, and a continued act: hence we may conclude against the
Papists; first, that neither their first, nor second justification, is that
justification, which is taught in the Scriptures. Not the second, for that is
not Gods action, but their own: who being justified before by habitual
righteousness infused from God, do themselves as they ^each, by practicing of
good works increase their righteousness, that is, justify themselves by
actual righteousness, as the merit of their second justification. Not, that
we deny, that inherent righteousness is by practice of good works increased;
but that we hold, that justification is not our own act, neither that we are
justified by any righteousness inherent in our selves, or performed by our
selves, nor that the righteousness of justification (which is indeed the
righteousness of Christ) can be increased, and therefore no degrees of
justification.

Not the first; which they make to be an action of God within us, working in
us a real change or positive mutation by infusion of the habits of grace, and
specially of charity, and confound it with habitual sanctification, from
which notwithstanding it is necessarily to be distinguished.

Secondly, justification being an action of God, is not to be confounded with
justification passively understood, and much less with justice it self. But
the Papists not only understand it passively, but also confound it with
inherent Justice.

Thirdly, they do not hold justification to be one continued act from our
vocation, to our glorification. But such an act, as may not only be
interrupted ostentimes, and lost for a time, as they say it is, by every
mortal sin, and again be renewed, so often as they go to shrift; but also
that it may totally and finally be lost. Which error I have confuted at large
in my Treatise of perseverance.

CAP. II. The efficient causes of Justification.
. I.

BUt in this definition besides the Genus, not only all the The Causes of
Justification.
causes of Justification, but also the essential parts thereof are briefly
comprised; which I will now distinctly propound. The causes, because in the
knowledge of them stands the science of every thing: the essential parts,
because in them justification it self consists. The causes of justification,
as of all other things, are four: The Efficient, the Matter, the Form, the
End.

The Efficie^t causes are of two sorts, either principal or isntrumental. The
principal is God, which I noted in the definition, when I said, The principal
efficient.
it is an action of God. For it is God that justifies, as the Scriptures in
many places do testify: as namely, Romans 3. 26, 30. 4. 5, 6. 8. 30, 33. Romans
3. 26, 30. 4. 5, 6. 8. 30, 33. Gal. 3. 8.
Gal. 3. 8. God, I say, the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost. For it being
an outward action of God (or, as the Schoolmen speak, ad extra) respecting
the Creatures, it is the common action of the whole Trinity. And thus God
alone, as the Judge does justify. For he alone is the Lawgiver, Ia^. 4. 12.
who has power over our souls against whom we sin, Psalm. 51. 4.
and by our sin become his debtours, when we transgress his law. And
therefore he alone properly forgiveth sins, as himself professes, Esaias 43.
25. and as the Scribes and Pharisees confess as a received Esaias 43. 25.
truth, Luke 5. 21. For who may take upon him to remit those debts, which we
owe to God? It is he, who reconcileth us unto himself in Christ, not imputing
our sins, 2 Cor. 5. 19. and accepting of us in his 2 Cor. 5. 19.
beloved, Ephesians. 1. 6. It is he alone, that forgiving our sins freeth us from
hell, and gives us right to his heave^ly kingdom. Which doctrine Ephesians. 1. 6.
serves, first, for our direction and instruction, where to seek and to sue
for justification and remission of sins. Not to any creature, but to God
alone in the name 1 John 21. 2.
and mediation of Christ, to whom alone our Savior directs us Matthew. 6. 12.
to sue for pardon. Secondly, it ministers strong consolation to all the
faithful. For seeing it is God that justifies them, Romans 8. 33.
who shall lay any thing to their charge? Who shall condemn, etc? Thirdly, it
s^rveth for the confutation, or rather condemnation of the Pope and all popish
priests, who take upon them power, not as Ministers of the Gospel to declare
and pronounce remission of sins, but as Judges to remit them: it being a
proper attribute of God, Exodus 34. Exodus 34. 7.
7. which he appropriateth to himself, Esaias 43. 25. and which no mere Esaias
43. 25.
man can without blasphemy arrogate to himself, Mark. 2. 7. Mark ^. 7.


. II. With the principal cause we are to join the consideration The Motives.
of the motives, or moving causes; both without God, which of some are called
(...), and also within himself, which are called (...). which are indeed
principia agendi. The former, are man's misery (which though it be not properly
a cause but the object of mercy, yet is said to be a motive, and is used as a
reason, to move to mercy Psalm. 6. 2. 123. 3. 31. 9.
; and thence misericordia has its name) and Christ's merits, which properly are
the procatarcticke cause of our justification, besides which there is no other
merit. The moving causes within God are his Mercy and his Justice, which I
signified in the definition, when I said, that justification is a most gr^cious
and right^ action os God. For as in many, if not in all the works of God, his
mercy and justice meet together, so especially in the work of our
Justification and redemption, which Cardinal C^jetan e well observed, The holy
Scripture, says he, does not say that we are justified by grace alone, but by
grace and justice together, but both of God, that is, by the grace of God and
by the justice of God, and not by the righteousness of men. By grace, I
understand the gracious love and favor of God in Christ, vouchsafed unto us in
him before all secular times, 2 Timothy 1. 9. in which he has graciously accepted
us in his beloved, by which In Romans 3. 24. Scriptura sacra non dicit nos
justificare per solam gratiam, sed per gratiam simul and iustitiam, sed
utramque Dei, hocest per gratiam Dei, and per iustitiam Dei, and non per
justitiam hominum. 2 Timothy 1. 9.
as we are elected and called and shall be saved; so by the same we are
justified, and that freely without any cause in us, Romans 3. 24. Now the Lord is
said to justify us by his grace, first, because of his free grace, he gave
his own Son to be our righteousness. Secondly, because of his own free
grace he has given us those means whereby the righteousness ^ Ephesians. 1. 6.
Romans 11. 5. Ephesians. 1. 5, 6. 2. 5. 8 2 Timothy 1. 9.
of Christ might be communicated unto us, as namely the Ministry of the Word
and of the Sacraments. Thirdly, because of his grace he blesses those means
unto us, working and increasing in us the grace of faith by which we are
justified: and las^ly, when we do by faith, Ephesians. 2. 8*
which is his gift, b^leeve, he freely imput^th unto us the righteousness of
Christ, accepts of us in him, and in him adopteth us to be his sons and
heirs of eternal life. The Lord is als^ just, in justisying a sinner. Romans 3.
25, 26.


. III. But as the Lord is gracious in justifying a believing sinner, so he is
also righteous, Romans 3. 25, 26. For therefore has the Lord set forth his son
and our Savior to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare
his righteousness through the remission of sins that are past by the
forbearance of God: to declare I say at this time his righteousness, that he
might be just, and the Iustifier of him which believes in Jesus. For such is
the righteousness of God, that he forgiveth no man's sin for which his
Justice is not fully satisfied by Christ: neither does he accept of any as
just, but such as by imputation of Christ's righteousness are made just in him.
The consideration of this justice of God in forgiving sins, does afford
singular comfort to the faithful. For seeing the Lord forgiveth no sin for
which his justice is not satisfied; and seeing our Savior has fully satisfied
the justice of his Father for the sins of all that believe in him: from hence
we may be assured, that as there is no condemnation to them that are in Christ
Jesus, so no punishment properly so called, that is, such a penalty as is
inflicted in ordine justitiae, and by way of vengeance: because it cannot stand
with the justice of God to punish the second time those sins in us, for which
his justice is already fully satisfied in Christ. The actions of the three
persons distinguished.


. IV. But the actions of God the principal efficient of justification are to
be distinguished, according to the distinction of the three Persons. For God
the Father justifies as the primary Cause and Author: the Son as the
meritorious cause: the holy Ghost as the cause applicatory, that is to say, God
the Father through the Son does justify The Father.
us by the holy Ghost. The Father, I say, as primary cause; and that in two
respects; first, in that he gave his only begotten Son for us, and set him
forth to be a (...) through faith in his blood, that all who believe in him
should be justified, Romans 3. 25. Ioh. 3. 16. Romans 3. 25. John 3. 16.
Secondly, as the Judge in absolving those that believe, and pronouncing them
just in Christ. The Son, as the Mediator and meritorious The Son.
cause; and that also in two respects. First, as he is our Surety, who paid our
debt, and our Redeemer who laid down the price of our redemption for us, Esaias.
53. 11. affording unto us the matter and merit of Esaias 53. 11.
our justification. Secondly, as he is our Intercessour and Advocate to plead
for us, that his merits may be imputed to us, Romans 8. 34. 1 Ioh. 2. 2. Romans 8.
34. 1 John 2. 2. Heb. 7. 25. 9. 24.
Heb. 7. 25. 9. 24. God the Father therefore justifies, as the primary cause
per authoritatem, as the Schoolmen speak; the Son, as the secondary Esaias
53. 11.
cause per ministerium. For so it is said, Esa. 53. 11. My righteous servant
shall justify many. The Father, as the Judge; the Son, as the Mediator and
Advocate. The Father, as the Creditour accepting Christ's satisfaction for us:
the Son, as the Surety paying our debt for us. But howsoever God the Father
has given his Son, and the Son has given himself for us, and has paid
that price, and performed that obedience which is sufficient for our
justification: notwithstanding none are actually justified by the merits of
Christ, but they only to whom they are applied. For although the sufferings of
Christ be a precious salve to cure our souls; yet they will not heal us
unless they be applied. And although his righteousness be as a wedding
garment to cover our nakedness, yet it will not cover us, unless it be put
on. In the third place therefore the holy Ghost may also be said to The holy
Gh^st.
justify us, because he does apply unto us Christ's merits unto our
justification; both as he is the Spirit of regeneration working in us the grace
of faith, by which we receive Christ unto our justification in foro coelesti:
and also as he is the Spirit of adoption confirming our faith, and working in
us the assurance of our justification, by which we are justified in foro
Conscientiae.

. V. Now the means of this application, are isntrumental causes Isntrumental
causes.
of our justification, and do justify instrumentally. And these are of two
sorts, viz. on Gods part, and on ours. For to effect this application, there
must be manus Dei offerentis, the hand of God offering, and manus accipientis,
the hand of the receiver. The instruments on Gods part, are the ministry of
the Word and Sacraments, whereby the holy Ghost does beget and confirm faith
in us. In respect whereof Ministers The Ministry of the Gospel.
are said to justify men; Dan. 12. 3. For as touching the ministry of the
Gospel: first, in it the benefit of the Messiah, as namely reconciliation,
adoption, and justification, etc. is revealed and offered to all that shall
believe, and by it we are stirred up to receive and embrace it. In which
respect the preaching of the Gospel is called the ministry of reconciliation;
and the Ministers are Gods Ambassadors sent to entreat men in Gods name and in
Christ's stead, that they would be reconciled 2 Cor. 5. 18, 20.
unto God, 2 Cor. 5. 18, 20. Secondly, the holy Ghost having thus by the
ministry of the Gospel knocked at the door of men's hearts, in his good time
makes it effectual, opening their hearts Acts 16. 14.
to give a lively and effectual assent to the Gospel, whereby they receiving
Christ and believing in him are justified. Thus faith comes by hearing Romans
10. 14, 17
the Word. And in this respect Preachers of the Gospel are said to be the 1
Cor. 3. 5.
Ministers by whom men do believe, 1 Cor. 3. 5. Thirdly, in the preaching of
the Gospel, seconded and made powerful by the operation of the holy Ghost,
the sentence of justification and remission of finnes, and consequently of
salvation is pronounced and concluded in the conscience of the faithful: when
as out of the general promise of the Gospel, Whosoever truly bel^eveth in
Christ has remission of sins, being by the Minister conditionally applied to
the hearer, and absolutely assumed by the believer, after this manner, If thou,
says the Minister, do truly believe in Christ, thou have remission of
sins and thou Romans 10. 9.
shall be saved, Romans 10. 9. But I (says the faithful hearer) do truly
believe in Christ, my conscience bearing me witness in the holy Ghost; this
conclusion is inferred, as the verdict of the holy Ghost testifying with the
conscience of the faithful in the assumption, according to Gods Word contained
in the proposition: therefore I have remission of sins, therefore I shall be
saved. And in this sense Ministers are said to remit sins, Ioh. 20. 23. and
consequently to justify, when they John 20. 23.
do pronounce remission of sins to them that believe and repent. And
whatsoever they do in this behalf upon earth according to the Word, is
ratified in heaven.

. VI. As touching the Sacraments: in them first the benefit of the Sacraments.
Messiah is represented before our eyes by the outward signs; whereupon the
Sacrament is called Verbum visibile. Secondly, such is the Sacramental union
between the sign and the thing signified, that together with the sign the
thing signified, that is, Christ with all his merits is offered in the lawful
use of the Sacrament. Thirdly, the benefit of the Messiah is not only offered
in the lawful use together with the sign, but also conferd and given to every
faithful and worthy receiver. And hereof the Sacrament is a pledge given to
the believer, to assure him, that as the Minister does give unto him the sign,
so the Lord does give unto him the thing signified. And in this sense every
Sacrament is a seal of that righteousness which is by faith, Romans 4. 11.
annexed to Romans 4. 11.
the promise of the Gospel, which by delivery of the Sacrament is particularly
applied to every faithful receiver, to assure him in particular of his
justification and salvation by Christ. Thus the ministry of the Gospel is the
means to beget faith, and the Sacraments the instruments to confirm the same.
But the Papists deny both, for that faith is begotten in the ministry of the
Word, and that so men attain to remission of sins and justification, they
say, it is a fiction of the heretics of these times. Neither do they grant
that Sacraments are seals of righteousness, or that they were ordained to
seal the promises unto us. But they hold them to be such effectual
instruments as do by virtue inherent in themselves confer justifying grace
(which they call gratiam gratum facientem) ex opere operat^. By which doctrine,
a, they have turned Religion into a mere outward formality, according to the
prophecy of them, 2 Timothy 3. 5. ascribing all the degrees of salvation to 2 Timothy
3. 5.
be achieved in this life, viz. Vocation, Justification, Sanctification to the
external use of the Sacraments; so they have made their doctrine of
justification to be an idle speculation, whereof in their practice there is
little or no use. For to what purpose do they dispute of justification, by
virtuous preparations and gracious dispositions, when they teach that the
Sacraments do ex opere operato, that is, by the very performance of the
outward act justify the receiver, requiring in him neither any virtuous
preparation, or gracious disposition, for without them he is justified. Only
this caution they do interpose, that he do not ponere obicem mortalis
peccati, that he put not the obstacle of mortal sin. For if those things
should necessarily be required, then the Sacraments should confer grace, not
ex opere operato, as they stiffly hold, but ex opere operantis. So much of the
hand of the giver.

. VII. The instrument on our part which is, as it were, manus Faith the
instrument to receive.
accipientis, the hand of the receiver, is the grace of justifying faith; which
I noted in the definition, when I said, that the Lord imputes the
righteousness of Christ to a believing sinner. Now as touching says, diverse
things are to be considered. For first, it is said to justify, not as it 1.
Faith justisieth not as it is an habit or gift in us, but as it is the hand ^o
receive Christ. g De Justif. l. 1. cap. 17.
is a quality or habit in us, as the Papists teach; ipsa fides, says g
Bellarmine, censetur esse justitia, faith it self is accounted to be justice,
and it self is imputed unto righteousness, Romans 4. 5. for so it is a part of
sanctification; but as it is the instrument, and, as it were, the hand to
receive Christ, who is our righteousness. For if we should be justified by
faith as it is an habit in us properly, then we should be justified by
habitual and inherent righteousness, which hereafter Lib. 4.
I shall fully disproveAnd if we be not justified by it, as it is an habit,
then much less as it is an act, as (...) and his followers teach; as though
(...) ipsum credere, did properly justify. Which opinion is worse than the
other. For faith does justify (as hereaster shall be proved) as the instrument
only; but it is the instrument, not as it is an act, but as it is an habit
producing that act: and therefore it is said that we are justified by faith,
and that faith is imputed Romans 4. 5.
unto righteousness. But if we should be justified by it, as it is an act,
then we should be justified by our own works: which hereafter Lib. 4. and 7.
is also to be confuted: and further, if we were justified by it, as it is an
act, then we should be no longer justified actually than we do actually
believe, (...) so there should be an intercision of justification (which I
proved before to be a continued act) so ost as there is an intermission of the
act of faith; which is ridiculous. Again, if we should be justified by faith,
either as it is an habit, or an act in sensu proprio; as they speak, and not
relatively or metonymically; then should we be justified by one habit alone, or
by the act of one habit: and consequently by a partial and most unperfect
righteousness. When it is certain that all the habits and acts of grace,
which are in the best, concurring together are not. sufficient to justify a
man before God for the reasons hereafter to be delivered, lib. 4. and 7. It is
true, that faith is imputed for righteousness, and is accepted of God, as the
perfect performance of the whole law: but this is to be understood relatively
in respect of the object received by faith, that is, Christ, who is the end
Romans 10. 5.
and complement of the Law to all that believe; insomuch that whosoever truly
believes in Christ, has fulfilled the Law. Secondly, it must be such a faith
as does specially apprehend and embrace Christ.


. VIII. 2. is the consequent of the former. For if faith does justify only as
it is an hand or instrument to apprehend and receive Christ, then justifying
faith must be such a faith as does apprehend Of this see mo^e, Lib 6. c. 4.
, receive and embrace Christ, which is not done, neither by the implicit, nor
the unformed, nor the bare historical and general faith of the Papists; but it
is done first by a lively and effectual assent to the special doctrine
concerning justification and salvation by Christ, which is the condition of the
Evangelicall promise; and then by a sound application of the promise to our
selves, as having that condition. For by a lively and effectual belief we
receive and embrace Christ, not only in our judgments by a willing and firm
assent, being undoubtedly persuaded and assured thathe is the Savior of all
that truly believe in him; but also in our hearts by an hungring desire to be
made partakers of him, and in our wills by resolving, both to acknowledge him to
be our Savior, and also to rest upon him for salvation. Having this lively
assent, which is the condition of the promise, we are to apply the promise to
our selves, as belonging to us. By the former degree we are justified, before
God in foro coelesti; by the latter, we are justified in foro conscientiae, in
the court of our own conscience. By the former, we are justified properly; by
the latter, we are not properly justified, but are in some measure assured of
our justification. By the former I do effectually believe, that Jesus is the
Savior; by the latter I do truly believe, that he is my Savior. That faith
therefore which does justify, does specially apprehend, and apply Christ: and
the proper object See Lib. 6. c. 6.. 2.
of faith, as it justifies, is Christ, or the promise of salvation by Christ;
and therefore is often called faith in Christ, or the faith of Christ. For
although by that faith, which justifies, I believe all the articles of
Christian religion, and every truth revealed by God in his word; yet I am not
justified properly by believing any other truth, but only by believing the
truth; neither is the promise of justification and salvation made to any other
belief, but only Ioh. 3. 16. Act. 16. 30, 31. Fat h do. h not dispose to
justificatio^, but it do. h actually justify.
to faith in Christ.

. IX. Thirdly, by this faith apprehending and receiving Christ, we are not
prepared only and disposed to justification, as the Papists absurdly teach,
affirming that faith does justify, even as servile Bellarm. de justificat.
lib. 1. ca 13.. Secun da dispositio.
fear does, by preparing only and disposing; for then a man endued with
justifying faith, might be as far from justification, as he that is possessed
with servile fear. But how can these two assertions be reconciled, that faith
does justify by disposing only as a preparative di^position, and yet that it
justifies formally as an habit infused, and as a part of inherent justice. But
the truth is, that by a true justifying faith we are not prepared only, but
we are actually justified. For no sooner does a man believe by a true
justifying faith, but he is justified Act. 13. 39.
and entitled unto the kingdom of heaven. As soon as he does believe, he is
translated Ioh. 5. 24.
from death to life, yea, so soon he has Ioh. 6. 47.
eternal life, that is, he has jus, right unto the heavenly kingdom.

. X. Fourthly, when we say that faith does justify, we do not Faith does
not justify absolutely in respect of its own worth, but relatively in respect
of the object.
mean that it justifies absolutely or in respect of its own worth and
dignity; and much less, that it does merit justification, either as it is an
habit, or as it is an act, but relatively in respect of the object which it
does apprehend, that is, Christ, who is our righteousness For seeing faith
does receive Christ and make us partakers of him, therefore all those benefits
which we receive from Christ are attributed in the holy Scriptures to Faith:
as to justify, to save See Lib. 6. cap. 4.. 6.
, etc. not, that these effects are to be ascribed to the virtue of faith
absolutely, but relatively in respect of the object. So when it was said to the
woman, thy Luke 7. 50.
faith has saved thee, the meaning is, Christ received by faith has saved
thee. Thus by the faith of Peter and John the Creeple was cured, Act. 3. 6. yet
not by Act. 3. 6. 12. ^6.
any power or holiness of theirs, verse. 12. But the name of Christ, that is,
Christ himself, by faith in his name, as the instrument, did cure him, verse.
16. so the name of Christ by faith in his name does justify and save, Act. 10.
43. John 20. 31. And that faith does not justify in respect of Act. 10. 43.
Ioh. 20. 31.
its own worth appears by this evidence, because the faith of diverse men,
though unequal in degrees does justify alike, and therefore is called (...),
of equal value, as Saint Peter speaks of all the faithful to whom he
writes, 2 Pet. 1. 1. (...), 2 Pet. 1. 1.
that is, as the Latin interpreter translateth, to them that have obtained
coequall faith with us in the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus
Christ. For it is not faith properly, which does justify, but the
righteousness of Christ, received by faith. The alms received by a weak hand
releeveth the party, as well as that which is received by a strong hand:
because it is not the hand properly which releeveth, but the alms. And for the
same cause the righteousness of justification is equal in all that are
justified, neither does it in the same persons admit of degrees. For it is the
most perfect righteousness of Christ, to which, considered as created and
finite, nothing can be added.

. XI. Fifthly, from hence we learn the true meaning of that question, The
meaning of the question, whether by faith, or by works.
whether we be justified by faith or by works, not as opposing the inward
grace of faith to the outward acts of obedience, which indeed are the fruits of
faith: but as opposing the righteousness of Christ apprehended by faith, to
that righteousness which is inherent in our selves, and performed by our
selves.

. XII. Sixthly, when we say that faith does justify alone, two things How
faith is said to justify alone.
are employed: First, that we are justified by the righteousness of Christ
alone apprehended by faith, and not by any righteousness in herent in us.
Secondly, that this righteousness of Christ, by which alone we are justified,
is apprehended by faith only. Not that justifying faith is or can be alone:
but because there being many graces in the faithful, which all have their
several commendations; yet none of them serves to apprehend Christ's
righteousness, but faith only, and yet that faith which is alone, severed
from all other inward graces, and outward obedience, does not justify either
alone or at all; because it is not a true and ^ lively, but a counterfeit and a
dead faith. For even as the eye among all the parts of the body, which all have
their several uses, has only the faculty of seeing: and yet that eye which
is separated from the rest of the parts, does see neither alone nor at all,
because it is but the carcass of an eye. So among all the graces of the soul,
it is the office of faith alone, as the eye of the soul, to look upon him
that was figured by the brazen Serpent: yet if it should be severed from the
rest, it were dead. For as Saint James Ia^. 2. 17.
says, that faith which is alone and by it self is dead. And as the eye, in
respect of being, is not alone, yet in respect of seeing it is alone: so faith
which is not alone, does justify alone.

XIII. Seventhly, and lastly, when we say that faith does justify Faith does
not sanctify alone.
alone, we were never so absurd, as the Papists absurdly charge us, as if we
meant, that faith alone does sanctify. For although nothing in us does
confer with faith to the act of justification as any cause thereof, (in which
sense we say, it justifies alone) yet in the subject; that is, the party
justified, many graces do concur with faith, as the necessary fruits
thereof; wherein, as also in our obedience, our sanctification stands,
wherefore faith, which justifies alone, is but one of those many graces,
wherein besides our obedience, our sanctification does consist.

CAP. III. Of the Essential causes of Justification; viz. The matter and the
form.
. I.

BUt let us come to the essential causes of justification, that The matter and
form of justification, what they are.
is to say, the matter and the form. The matter of justification, considered
as it is an action of God, is that which the Lord imputes unto us for
righteousness, and accepts as our righteousness, and that is the
righteousness of Christ, which I noted in the definition, when I said,
imputing to a believing sinner the righteousness of Christ. The Papists
confounding not only justice and justification, but also the matter (which is
the material cause) and the subject; say, that the matter of justification is
the soul of Bellarm. de justifi. lib. cap. 2.
man, or at the least the will of man; because that is the seat of justice,
whereas indeed of justification, though passively understood, not the soul or
the will is the subject, but the person or the whole man. For justification is
totius suppositi, of the person, and not of any part or faculty of man. But for
the better clearing of this point, let us briefly consider other not unlike
actions: First, when Rebecca arrayed or clothed her son Jacob with the
raiment of Esau her elder son, the matter of this action was that, which
being applied unto him, did clothe him, viz. Esau's garment: the form of that
action was the applying of it to him, which was the indution or putting it on.
For she clothed him by putting upon him Esau's garment. So the Lord justifies
us by putting upon us our eldest brothers righteousness, which is our wedding
garment. Which similitude is used not only by Saint De Jacob. and vitabeat. l.
2. cap. 6.
Ambrose, but also by Pighius himself, as hereafter Lib. 5. cap. 4. sect. 4.
shall be showed. The matter therefore of justification is Christ's
righteousness: the form is the imputing thereof. Secondly, the actions of
redemption, reconciliation and justification in substance are the same. As
therefore the Lord redeemeth us, and reconcileth us by applying unto us and
accepting for us the righteousness and merits of Christ, as the (...), or
price of ransom, and as the propitiation; for God was in Christ reconciling
the world to himself, 2 Cor. 5. 19. so he justifies us, by applying unto us
and accepting for us, the same righteousness and merits of Christ, as our
righteousness. As the matter therefore of our redemption is the (...), or
price of ransom which Christ paid for us; the matter of reconciliation is the
propitiatory sacrifice which Christ offered for us; the matter of justification
is Christ's righteousness which he had and performed for us: so the form of
redemption, as it is Gods action, is the applying unto us the price of ransom
which Christ paid, and the accepting of it in our behalf; the form of
reconciliation, the applying unto us the propitiation made by Christ, and
accepting of it in our behalf; the form of justification, the applying or
imputing of Christ's righteousness unto us, and accepting it in our behalf. In
like manner the Papists, if they would consider Justification as an action of
God, should according to their own doctrine conceive, that of their first
justification; whereby as they teach, a sinner is made righteous by infusion of
righteousness; the matter is the righteousness infused or inherent, the form
the infusion thereof: because according to their doctrine, the Lord in the
first justification makes a man righteous by infusion of righteousness. The
Papists confess after a sort, the righteousness of Christ to be the merit of
justification, but they deny it to be the matter thereof, whereas indeed it is
both: the matter, as justification is the act of God imputing it; the merit, as
justification is passively understood, because for it we are justified: the
matter, I say, of Gods justifying us; the merit of our being justified. And
this may appear by the contrary: For justification, as has been said, and
shall be proved, is opposed Matthew. 12. 37. Rom 8. 33. 1 King. 8. 32.
to condemnation. As therefore sin is not only the matter of condemnation,
which is the imputation of sin; but also the merit both of the sentence, and
of the punishment by the sentence awarded: so the righteousness of Christ is
both the matter of justification, as being that which God imputes to us; and
also the merit both of the sentence of absolution, and of eternal life, unto
which we are accepted.

. II. But of the matter and form of justification, whereof I am Of the matter
and form distinctly.
hereafter to treat at large; of the matter, in the whole fourth book; of the
form, in the fifth, I will here only set down briefly the orthodox doctrine
of the reformed Churches, and maintain it against the private opinions of some
protestant Divines, who are not sound in these points.

The matter of justification is that righteousness, wherein we stand The
matter is that which is called the righteousness of God.
perfectly righteous before God. This in many places is called the
righteousness of God. As Romans 1. 17. 3. 21. 10. 3. 2 Cor. 5. 21. 2 Pet. 1. 1.
And is therefore called the righteousness of God, because it is the
righteousness of that person, who is God, See Lib. 4. c. 2.. 2.
and therefore is not our righteousness, but his; not infused into us, but
inherent in his person, Whether this righteousness of God be the
righteousness of the Godhead.
and imputed to us, being without us in him. Hear then we are to consider
whether this righteousness of God be the righteousness of Christ, as he is
God, or as he is mediator betwixt God and man, 1 Tim^ 5.
the man Christ Jesus. The righteousness of Christ, as he is God, is the
essential righteousness of the Godhead. By which dwelling in man, Osiander
supposed them to be justified. But this, being the essential and uncreated
righteousness of God, which is his essence, and therefore himself, cannot be
the righteousness of any who is not God; and therefore if we should be
justified thereby, we should also be deified. Again, the essential
righteousness of God, being the essence of God and the very Godhead, cannot be
communicated to any creature, much less can it become the accidental
righteousness of a creature. And farther, it being the righteousness of the
Godhead, is the common righteousness of the whole Trinity, the Father, the
Son, and the holy Ghost. And therefore if we should be justified thereby, we
should be justified by the righteousness of the Father, and of the holy Ghost,
as well as by the righteousness o^ the Son.

. III. It is not therefore the righteousness of the Godhead. Is it Whether it
be the righteousness of the Manhood.
then the righteousness of the Manhood? I answer, it is the righteousness of
Christ our Mediator, who is both God and man which he in his humanity had and
performed in the days of his flesh for us. And this is to be understood not
of a part but of the whole righteousness of Christ, which was either inherent
in the man Christ, or performed by him; whether to fulfill the Commandments,
or to satisfy the Curse of the Law for us. This righteousness of Christ (that
I may speak more distinctly of it) is either negative (if I may so speak) or
positive. By the negative, I understand an absence of all sins and vices
forbidden in the Law. By the positive, I mean both a presence of all virtues
and duties required to the perfect fulfilling of the Commandments, and also of
the voluntary suffering of the penalty to satisfy the commination and curse of
the Law. The Negative is that, which we call the innocence of Christ, whereof
the Scriptures speak in many places: The innocence of Christ.
signifying that he was not only blameless, free in himself from all
imputation of sin, being (...), unreproveable, (...), unblameable John 8. 46.
1 Pet. 1. 19. but also spotless, free from all infection of John 8. 46. 1 Pet.
1. 19. 1 Pet. 1. 19. Heb. 7. 26. 1 Pet. 2. 22, 23.

nor ever offended in thought, but was absolutely and in all respects (...),
without sin, Heb. 4. 15. as one 2 Cor 5. 21.
who knew Heb. 4. 15.
no sin.

. IV. The positive righteousness of Christ, is twofold, his perfect Christ's
positive righteousness.
fulfilling of all things commanded in the Law, and his perfect satisfaction in
respect of the punishment threatened. The former is the holiness of Christ,
which the Apostle calls the Law of the Spirit of life in Christ, Romans 8. 2.
which is also twofold, the holiness of his nature, Romans 8. 2.
which is his habitual righteousness: the holiness of his life and
conversation, which is his actual obedience. The holiness of his Nature, The
holiness of his Nature.
in that being conceived of the holy Ghost, and sanctified by him Matthew. 1. 22.

graces, and that without measure, John 3. 34. In respect whereof he was said
to be anointed with the oil of gladness above his fellows, Psalm. 45. 7.
for he was full of the Spirit, Esai. 11. 2. full of grace and Psalm. 45. 7.
Esai. 11. 2. Ioh. 1. 14.
truth, John 1. 14. full, I say, not plenitudine vasis, in which sense foam of
the faithful have been said to have been full of the holy Ghost, and full of
grace; but plenitudine fontis, for of his fullness we receive even grace for
grace, John 1. 16. according to the measure of the donation John 1. 16. Ephesians.
4. 7.
of Christ, Ephesians. 4. 7. The holiness of Christ's life was that whereby The
holiness of his lise.
he continued in all the things which were written in the book of the Law to
do them, and that for us. For he came not to break the Law, Matthew. 5. 1^.
Matthew. 3. 15. Ioh. 8. 29. Romans 8. 4. Esaias 53. 11. Act 4. 27. Heb. 7. 26. 1 Ioh.
2. 20. Apoc. 3. 7. Act 3. 14. 1 Ioh. 2. 2. Act. 2. 27. Dan. 9. 24.
but to fulfill it, Matthew. 5. 17. He fulfilled all righteousness, Matthew 3. 15.
and always did those things which please God, Ioh. 8. 29. He performed in his
flesh (...), whatsoever the Law requires to justification, Romans 8. 4. and
therefore most worthily is he often called in the Scriptures not only
righteous and holy, as Esaias 53. 11. Act. 4. 27. Heb. 7. 26. 1 Ioh. 2. 20. Apoc.
3. 7. but also the just and the holy, Act. 3. 14. the just, 1 Ioh. 2. 2. the
holy one of God, Act. 2. 27. the holy of holies, Dan. 9. 24.

The other part of Christ's positive righteousness is his passive obedience,
which is called Obedientia Crucis, the obedience of the Cross, His passive
righteousness. Phil. 2. 8.
wherein he willingly submitted himself to endure those punishments for us,
which might satisfy the Justice of God, and the sentence of the Law for our
sins, as it is said, Phil. 2. 8. He humbled himself and became obedient to
the death, even the death of the Cross, and Gal. 3. 13. Gal. 3. 13.
Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the Law, himself being made a curse
for us. Now this passive obedience appears not only in his death and
passion, though in that principally, but also in all other his sufferings which
he voluntarily sustained for us in the whole course of his life, as 2 Cor. 8 9.
poverty, Heb. 12. 2.
shame, Esaias 53. 3.
sorrow, etc. The matter therefore of our justification is that whole
righteousness, which was either inherent in the man Christ, or performed by
him; whether to fulfill the commandments, or to satisfy the curse of the Law
for us.

V. This righteousness of Christ our Mediator, though inherent The
righteousness of Christ by which we are justified is the righteousness of
God.
in the humane nature and performed by it, yet is most truly, and to us most
comfortably called (according to that kind of phrase which is termed (...),
the communication of properties) the righteousness of God, because it is the
righteousness of that Person, which is God; who, though a branch of David
according to the flesh, is Jehovah our righteousness, Ier. 23. 6. God above
all blessed for evermore, Romans 9. 5. Ier. 23. 6. Romans 9. 5. Act. 3. 15.
In this sense the Jews are said to have killed the Author of life, Act. 3.
15. and to have crucified the Lord of Glory, 1 Cor. 2. 8. For as the blessed
Virgin Luke 1. 43.
is said to be (...), the Mother of God, because she is the Mother 1 Cor. 2. 8.
of that Person who is God: so the righteousness of our Mediator, who is both
God and man, is called the righteousness of God; because it is the
righteousness of that Person, who is perfect God. Thus that blood, by which
we are redeemed, is called the blood of Act. 2^. 28. 1 Ioh. 1. 7. 3. 16.
God, Act. 20. 28. or, which is all one, the blood of the Son of God, 1 Ioh.
1. 7. The life which was laid down for us, was the life of God, 1 Ioh. 3. 16.
the death by which we are reconciled to God, is the death Romans 5. 10.
of his Son, Romans 5. 10. the obedience by which we are constituted just,
Romans 5. 19. is the obedience of the same Son of God; who being Romans 5. 19.
God coequall with his Father, humbled himself and became obedient to his
Father even unto death, Phil. 2. 6, 8. and being the Son Phil. 2. 6, 8.
of God, was made subject to the Law, that he might redeem those that were
under the Law, that we might receive the adoption of sons, Gal. 4. 4. 5. Gal.
4. 4, 5.


VI. This doctrine of the Gospel, that the righteousness, by The consort
arising from this doctrine.
which we are justified, is the righteousness of God, is the chief stay of
our faith, and the principal foundation of our comfort. For hereby we
understand, his sufferings to be an all-sufficient satisfaction to redeem us
from hell, and his obedience of all-sufficient merit to entitle us unto the
kingdom of heaven. And that we might know undoubtedly, that his sufferings
were the sufferings of God, and his obedience the obedience of God, that is, of
him that is God; therefore by his divine Spirit, by which he had offered
himself to God, Heb. 9. 14.
he raised himself from death to life, and to 1 Pet. 1. 21.
glory; by which his resurrection, he was mightily declared to be the Son
Romans 1. 4.
of God, that our faith and hope might be in God. For had not Christ risen
from the dead, it had been a plain evidence of his not being God; and then
our faith 1 Cor. 15 14. 17.
were va^ne, and we should yet remain in our sins. But seeing Jesus Christ,
who is of God made unto us 1 Cor. 1. 30.
righteousness, is God, even Ier. 23. 6.
Jehovah our righteousness, hence we learn, that the righteousness, by
which we are justified, is the righteousness of God; and consequently of
infinite price and merit. For although the Godhead of Christ neither obeyed,
nor suffered any thing for us: yet seeing the person, which obeyed and
suffered, was and is not only man, but also God: therefore the Godhead
affords such d^gnity, virtue, efficacy and merit to the obedience and
sufferings of his Manhood; as that his sufferings are an allsufficient price of
ransom, and satisfaction for the sins of the whole world, as being the
sufferings of God, and therefore of infinite value: and his holiness and
obedience being the righteousness of God, and therefore of infinite merit, and
far surpassing the righteousness of all men and Angels; makes all those, to
whom it is imputed, most perfectly righteous before God in Christ. Wherefore
they who are clothed with this royal robe of Christ's righteousness (as all
the faithful are) may with boldness appear before the judgment seat of God,
because they stand just before him, not in their own righteousness, which is
unperfect; but in the most perfect righteousness of Christ, against which no
just exception can be taken. After this righteousness therefore of Christ we
ought to hunger Matthew. 5. 6.
and thirst; after this righteousness of God Matthew. 6. 33.
we ought principally to seek* to obtain this most precious Matthew. 13. 46.
pe^rle, we are to forgo all that we have, esteemimg our own righteousness
(in the question of justification, if it should be obtruded as the matter
thereof) and whatsoever else of ours might seem to be an advantage unto us,
or praiseworthy among men, as polluted Esaias 64. 6.
clouts, as Phil. 3. 7, 8. 9.
dung, and the opinion of our own worthiness and righteousness as Phil. 3.
7, 8. 9.
loss, so we may obtain that pearl; and that we gaining Christ may be
found in him, not as having our own righteousness, which is that which is
prescribed in the ^aw, but that which is by the faith of Christ, the
righteousness which is of God by faith, that is the righteousness of Christ
which is imputed of God, being apprehended by faith. Now that this
righteousness of God is the matter of our justification before God, and not
any righteousness inher^nt in us, or performed by us, I shall prove at large
in my fourth and seventh Books. Here only I allege the plain testimonies of
the holy Ghost, 1 Cor. 1. 30.
that Christ is made unto us of God our righteousness, 1 Cor. 1. 30 that he
is Ier. 23. 26.
Jehovah our righteousness, and that by his blood we are justified and
absolved from our sins, Rom 5. 9. and by his obedience, Romans 5. 9. 19.
opposite to Adams disobedience, we are made or constituted just, Romans 5. 19.

VII. The formal cause of justification is the imputation of Christ's The
formal cause. Imputation of Christ's righteousness.
righteousness, because by imputing it the Lord does justify; which ^
expressed in the definition. And this necessarily follows upon that which
has been said of the matter. For it cannot be imagined how we should be
justified by that righteousness of Christ, which is out of us in him,
otherwise than by imputation. For even as we were made sinners by Adams
personal Romans 5. 19.
disob^dience; so we a^e made righteous by the obedience of Christ. But how
could we either be made sinners by Adams disobedience, or justified by the
obedience of Christ, whether active or passive, unless they were communicated
unto us. How could they possibly be communicated unto us, being both
transient, and having now no being? For true is that saying of a learned
Philosopher, ^ul. Scaliger. de su^til.
Motus non est nisi dum fit; postquam factus est, non est: A motion (whether it
be action or passion) has no being, but whiles it is in doing or suffering;
after it is done, it has no being. Adams tranl gression was transient, and is
past and gone so many thousand years past: the active obedience of Christ was
transient, and so was his passive obedience, which had a being in rerum natura,
no longer than they were in doing and in sus^ring. How then can either Adams
disobedience, or Christ's obedience be communicated unto us? I answer, in
respect of both, as Bellarmine De amiss gratia and statu pecc. lib. 5. cap. 17.
Itaque.
answers in respect of the former. Communicatur eo modo, quo communicari
potest, id quod trans^it, nimirum per imputationem: It is communicated after
that manner, whereby that may be communicated which is transient and gone, to
wit, by imputation.

. VIII. The same Bellarmine De Justif. l. 2. sect. cap 7. sect. Quarto etc. 10.
sect. Deinde.
with other Papists does confess, that the satisfaction of Christ is imputed
unto us; but the imputation of his righteousness they deny, when as indeed the
imputation of Christ's ^atisfaction, is the imputation of his righteousness,
for what is Christ's satisfaction but that whereby he ^ully satisfied the Law,
and consequently the justice of God for us, which he did both in respect of the
penalty, which he fully satisfied by Esai. 53. 11.
bearing our iniquities; and also of the commandments, by fulfilling them: the
former, is the obedience of the cross, or his passive righteousness; the
latter, is his conformity to the Law, which is both his habitual and actual
righteousness. By the former, he freeth us from hell* by the latter, he does
entitle us to the kingdom of heaven. But the meaning of the Papists is, that
Christ by his satisfaction does free us from hell; but as for heaven, we must
attain to it by our own merits, as if there needed not so great a price to
purchase heaven, as to redeem from hell. But it is certain, that there is
required as infinite merit to purchase heaven, as there is required infinite
satisfaction to redeem from hell. In respect of both God accepts of no
righteousness to our justification, that is, either to free us from hell, or
to entitle us unto the Kingdom of Heaven, but that which is of infinite value;
because the offense of sin, for which satisfaction is to be made, is
infinite, and because the reward which is to be merited, is of infinite worth.
But, that righteousness may be of infinite value, it is not necessary, as
Bellarmine De justificat. lib. 2. cap. 5. in fine.
himself teaches, that it should be infinite in it self; but it is
sufficient, that it be the righteousness of an infinite person. And such is
the righteousness of Christ, as being the righteousness of him, that is, God;
such is not the righteousness of any mere creature: which is an invincible
argument, as hereafter shall be showed, to prove that we are justified not by
any righteousness in our selves, but only by imputation of Christ's
righteousness.

. IX. And yet this imputation of Christ's righteousness (without Imputation of
Christ's righteousness denied not only by Papists, but also by some others.
which there can be no salvation) is denied, not only by the Papists, but by
some others hereafter to be mentioned in the fifth chapter of this book; who
seem to have been drawn to this opinion by this argument of the Papists;
which I will therefore in this place answer, for their satisfaction. If (say
they) Christ's righteousness and merits, whereby The reason of their denia^
confuted.
he redeemeth and saves men should be imputed unto us, then should we
thereby become Saviors and redeemers of others: but this latter is false;
therefore the former. Answer: I deny the consequence of the proposition; for
first, when we say, that we are justified by imputation of Christ's
righteousness, our meaning is this, that the Lord accepts for us, and in our
behalf, the obedience and m^rits of Christ, as if we had performed the same
for our selves in our own persons. For as the merit of Christ is the common
price of redemption sufficient for the salvation of all universally, so it is
the price for every particular; and so is applied to every particular, not as
the common price redeeming all, but as the price of those souls in particular,
to whom it is particularly applied. Secondly, the efficacy, or effect of
imputation depends upon the will of the imputer, and therefore the force of
it cannot be extended further than he extends it; which is the justification
of the parties to whom it is imputed, but no further. Thirdly, the consequence
of the proposition does no more follow, than if I should argue thus: If by
imputation of Adams transgression others are made guilty of sin and
damnation, then they to whom Adams transgression is imputed are made the cause
and fountain of sin and damnation in all others; but of the first and second
Adam we should conceive, not as of private men; but the first Adam is to be
considered, as the root of mankind, in whom when he fell, all sinned. The
second, as the head of all that shall be sa^ed, in whom, as the head
communicating his merits to his members, all the faithful have (as his
members) fulfilled the Law, and satisfied the justice of God for themselves.
The head and the body, says Sum. 3. p. q. 48. art. 2. and q 49. ar^t. 1. Caput
and membrum sunt quasi una person na mystica: and ideo satisfactio Christi ad
omnes fideles pertinet, sicut ad ^ua membra.
Thomas Aquinas, are as it were one mystical person, and therefore the
satisfaction of Christ belongs to all the faithful, as to his members: the
Lord accepting in their behalf the obedience and Merits of Christ, as if they
had performed the same in their own persons, not for others, but for
themselves. And therefore by imputation of Christ's righteousness they are not
redeemers, but redeemed. For though Christ, who is the Savior of his body,
communicate to his members his obedience, yet not his Headship, nor his
Mediatorship, in respect whereof he was and is both God and man. Man, to do
and suffer: God, to give infinite value and worth to that which his Person did
or suffered, for the justification and salvation of all those to whom his
righteousness should be communicated and imputed; but not to make them
redeemers and Saviors of others. The righteousness of the head is of
sufficient virtue to justify and redeem all the members to whom it is
imputed; but being imputed, the merit thereof extends no further, than to
what end it is imputed; that is, to save the member, not to make it a Savior,
nor to confound the members with the head, nor to take away the proportion,
that is and ought be between the head and the members. Fourthly, to the
Papists, who confess Christ's satisfaction to be imputed unto us, I return the
like argument. If Christ's satisfaction, whereby he redeemed mankind be imputed
unto us, then are we also redeemers of mankind: But they will not, not cannot
infer, that therefore we are redeemers, but that we among others are
redeemed.

. X. But that we are justified only by the imputation of Christ's
righteousness, I shall by the help of God, fully prove hereafter in my whole
fifth book. Here only for a taste, I will but point at two argumenss, Romans 4.
5. 6. 11.
the former out of Romans 4. 5. 6. 11. the basis or ground whereof is this, that
whom the Lord justifies, to them he imputes righteousness. Now this
righteousness is either the parties own, or of another. Not their own, for
they are sinners, and being sinners they cannot be justified by righteousness
inherent, but righteousness is imputed to them without works, that is,
without respect of any obedience performed by themselves. Therefore it is the
righteousness of another: That other is no other, nor can be any other, but
Christ only; therefore by imputation of his righteousness we are justified.
The second shall be out of 2 Cor. 5. 21. As Christ was made sin for us, so
are we made 2 Cor. 5. 21.
the righteousness of God in him. By imputation of our sin to him, Christ,
who knew no sin, was made sin, and a sinner for us; therefore by imputation
of his righteousness, which here is called the righteousness of God, we who
are sinners in our selves are made righteous, not in our selves, but in him.

CAP. IV. Whether we are justified by the passive righteousness of Christ
only.
. I.

NOw I come to the private opinions of some of our Divines The private opinions
of some Divines concerning the matter of justification.
concerning the matter and some of our justification. For some as touching the
matter, do hold that we are justified by the passive righteousness of Christ
only. Of these men, some do not hold the matter of justification to be the
passive righteousness of Christ it self, but a righteousness morte Christi
partu^, purchased by the death of Christ, as the meritorious cause thereof,
viz. remission of sins, which they not without absurdity say is imputed to
us. For what is remission of sin, but the not imputing of it? If therefore
we be justified by imputation of the remission of sin, then are we
justified by the imputation of the not imputing of sin. Again, the authors
of this opinion confound justice with justification; for they say, that
remission of sin is our justice, and that justification is nothing also but
remission; when indeed neither the one, nor the other is justice, but an action
of God, imputing righteousness and not imputing sin unto us. Others hold
that by the passive righteousness of Christ it self meaning thereby his death
and passion, we are justified, as by the only matter of justification imputed
to us. But that we are not justified by the passive righteousness of Christ
alone, it may appear by these reasons:

. II. By what alone the Law is fully satisfied, by that we are justified, The
first reason, because there is no justification without the fulfilling of the
Law.
and by what alone the Law is not fully satisfied, by that alone we are not
justified. By the whole righteousness of Christ, that is to say, the
righteousness of his person, that is, his holiness, or habitual
righteousness; the righteousness of his life, which was his obedience or
actual righteousness; the righteousness of his death and passion, which is
obedientia crucis, or his passive righteousness, the Law was fully satisfied
or fulfilled: but by the passive obedience alone of Christ the Law was not
fulfilled; therefore by the whole righteousness of Christ and not by the
passive only we are justified. The proposition is thus proved: there is no
justification before God without perfect and complete righteousness, for
without that no man can stand in judgment before God, and to imagine, that a
man is justified without justice, is as absurd, as to conceive that a man is
clothed without apparel: For they that are justified are clothed Psalm. 132. 9.
with righteousness, as having Gal. 3. 27.
put on Christ, whose righteousness is their wedding garment, Matthew. 22. 11.
signified by that white and shining linen, Apoc. 19. 8.
which are the justifications of the Saints. But there is no perfect
righteousness, but that which fulfilleth the Law, and is fully conformable
unto it, it being the perfect, perpetual and immutable Matthew. 5. 18.
rule of righteousness, Matthew. 5. 18. therefore without the fulfilling of the
Law, either by our selves, or by another for us, there is no justification. Now
to the full satisfying and fulfilling of the Law, since the fall of Adam, two
things are required; not only a perfect and perpetual conformity to the Law
to satisfy the commandment, and to fulfill the condition of the legal Lev.
18. 5. Romans 10. 5. Gal 3. 12.
promise, Do this and live: but also a full satisfaction to the sentence of
the Law by bearing the penalty therein denounced, in regard of sins already
committed. Again, faith or the true doctrine of justification by faith, does
not abrogate the Romans 3. 31.
Law, but establish it. But if it should teach justification without Christ's
fulfilling of the Law for us, it should abrogate the Law, and not establish it.

III. Of the assumption there are two parts: the former affirmative, By the
passive righteousness of Christ only the Law is not fulfilled.
that by the whole righteousness of Christ the Law is fully satisfied and
fulfilled; for by his sufferings the penalty of the Law is fully satisfied for
us to free us from hell, and by his righteousness, both hab^tuall and actual,
the commandments were fulfilled for us, to entitle us unto heaven. Neither of
which we were able to perform for our selves: for neither could we satisfy
the penalty, but by everlasting punishment; neither could we fulfill the
commandment, but by a total, perfect, and perpetual obedience; which to us,
by reason of the flesh, is unpossible. And this was the miserable estate,
wherein the Law did hold us: both to be accursed, if but once, and that in the
least degree we did break it (which the best of us often do, and sometimes
in an high degree) and to be excluded from justification and salvation, if we
did not fully and perfectly fulfill it, which since the fall has been
impossible. Wherefore as without imputation of Christ's sufferings we could not
be freed from hell; so without his obedience and perfect conformity to the Law
imputed unto us, we cannot be justified or saved. By the former, our blessed
Savior has redeemed us from the curse Gal. 3. 13.
of the Law, himself being made a curse for us; by the latter he makes us
partakers of the promised blessedness, by performing for us that
righteousness, which was the condition of the promise, Do this and live.

The negative part is, that by the only passive righteousness of Christ the
Law is not fulfilled. The Law indeed is thereby fully satisfied in our behalf
for the avoiding of the penalty therein threatened; but not fulfilled in respect
of the commandment for the obtaining of the blessedness therein promised. For
the righteousness, which is of the Law, is thus described, that the man Romans
10. 5.
which does those things (which are commanded) shall live therein. And that is
defended against diverse excep^ons. First, that the Law is satisfied by bearing
the penalty.


IIII. Against this assumption diverse exceptions are taken. First, that the Law
is satisfied either by doing that which is commanded, or by bearing the
punishment, which is threatened. Answ. It is true in respect of the penal
statutes of men, but not in respect of Gods commandments, in which there is
not only a penalty threatened, but blessedness also promised. If man had
continued in his integrity, the Law might have been satisfied by obedience
only: but being fallen into a state of disobedience, two things are
necessarily required to the fulfilling of the Law; the bearing of the penalty,
in respect of sin already committed, to escape hell; and the perfect
performing of the commandments, which is the condition of the covenant, Do
this and live, to attain to the life promised: but neither alone will suffice
to justification. For neither will our obedience satisfy for the punishment De
justis. lib. 2. cap. 10. Scct. Deinde.
as Bellarmine confesses; nor the bearing of the punishment perform the
condition of the promise. But both must concur.

V. Inst. I. But it will be said, that whosoever are freed from hell, Secondly,
that those who are freed from hell, are admitted untobeaven.
are also admitted into heaven. Answ. The reason thereof is, because our
Savior, who did bear the punishment to free them from hell, did also fulfill
the commandments to bring them to heaven. But howsoever these two benefits of
Christ do always concur in the party justified; as the causes thereof
concur in Christ, who not only did both obey and suffer, but in obeying
suffered, and in suffering obeyed: yet both the causes between themselves and
the effects are to be distinguished. For as it is one thing to obey the
commandment, another to suffer the punishment: so it is one thing to be freed
from hell by Christ his suffering the penalty, another to be entitled to
heaven by his fulfilling the commandments.

VI. Inst. II. Yea but God is a most free Agent, and therefore Thirdly, that
God may justify by the passive righteousness only if be will.
may if he will justify men by the passive righteousness of Christ only
without fulfilling of the Law. Answ. What God may do, if he will, I will not
dispute; but ^ure I am, that he justifies men according to his will revealed
in his word. Wherein it is revealed, first, that God has taken that course for
the justifying and saving of sinners, as serves most for the illustration of
the glory of his justice, Romans 3. 25, 26.
as well as of his mercy. And therefore as in mercy he freeth none from hell,
for whom his justice is not satisfied: so in mercy he admits none to
heaven, for whom Christ has not by his obedience merited the fame. Secondly,
it is revealed, that the judgment of God is according to the Romans 2. 2.
truth, and therefore he justifies none by his sentence, but such as he
makes just by imputation of Christ's righteousness; thereby not only
absolving them from their sins, but also accepting, yea constituting them
righteous in CHRIST. Thirdly, that as we are justified from our sins by the
blood of Christ; so we are made Romans 5. 9. 19.
just by his obedience: that as he was made finne for us, so we were made 2
Cor. 5. 21.
the righteousness of God in him; that as we are reconciled unto God by the
death Romans 5. 10.
of his Son, so we are justified and saved by his life: by his life, I say,
which he lived before his death in the days of his flesh; and by the life
which he lived, and does live, after his death. By the acts of his life before
his death, meritoriously; by the acts of his life after his death, as his Romans
4. 25.
resurrection, his ascension, his session at the right hand of his Father and
intercession, his coming again to judgment, he saves us effectually, that
Christ as he was made unto us redemption, so also righteousness; that as he
came to deliver us from sin, so to 1 Cor. 1. 30. Dan. 9. 24.
bring in everlasting righteousness, Dan. 9. 24.

VII. Inst. III. If we be justified by Christ his fulfilling of the If by
Christ's fulfilling of the Law, then by a legal righteousness.
Law then we are justified by a legal righteousness; but we are not
justified by a legal justice; but by such a righteousness, as without the Law
is revealed in the Gospel. Answ. The same righteousness, by which we are
justified, is both legal and Evangelicall in diverse respects. Legal, in
respect of Christ, who being made under the Gal. 4 5.
Law, that he might redeem us, who were under the Law, perfectly fulfilled
the Law for us. Evangelicall, in respect of us, unto whom his fulfilling of the
Law is imputed. And herein stands the maine, both agreement and difference
between the Law and the Gospel. The agreement, that both unto justification
require the perfect fulfilling of the Law: the difference, that the Law
requires to justification perfect obedience to be performed in our own
persons. The Gospel propounds to justification the righteousness of Romans 1.
17. 3. 21.
God, that is, the perfect righteousness of Christ, who is God, performed for
us, and accepted in the behalf of them that believe, as if it had been
performed in their own persons. The second reason out of Romans 5. 19.


VIII. Our second reason. As by the disobedience of the first Adam, by which he
transgressed the Law, men were made sinners, his disobedience being imputed to
them: so by the obedience Romans 5. 19.
of the second Adam whereby he fulfilled the Law, men are made righteous, his
obedience being imputed to them. In answer to this argument, two novelties are
broached; the former, that as we were made sinners by one act of disobedience
committed by one man, and that but once: so we are justified by one act of
obedience performed by one and that but once; which was that oblation of
Christ, whereby he but once Heb. 9. and 10.
offered himself. Whereunto I reply, first, that between sin, whereby the
Law is broken, and obedience whereby the Law is fulfilled, there is great ods.
The Law is broken by any one act of sin; for he that offends in any Iam.
2. 10.
one, is guilty of all. But the Law is not fulfilled by any one act of
obedience, but by a total, perfect, and perpetual observation of the Law; for
by the sentence Gal. 3. 10.
of the Law he is accursed, whosoever does not continue in all the things
which are written in the book of the Law to do them. But in no one act of
obedience, there neither is, nor can be a continuance in doing all the things
that are commanded. Secondly, that although the obedience by which we are
justified was but of one man, yet it was not one act, but as the Apostle
calls it in the verse going Romans 5. 18.
before, (...). Now (...) Romans 8. 4.
is all that the Law requires to justification. The second Novelty is, that
neither Adam in sinning transgressed the Law, nor our Savior in his obedience
to death obeyed the Law. For neithe^ the commandment given to the first Adam
concerning the forbidden fruit, nor the commandment given to the second Adam
concerning his suffering of death for us, was any commandment of the Law; no
more than the commandment given to Abraham for the sacrificing of his son,
or to the Israelites for the spoiling of the Egyptians, but a special
commandment. Whereto I reply, that although every thing which God commands
in particular, be not expressed in the Law; yet we have a general
commandment Deuteronomy. 12. 32.
expressed in the Law, that whatsoever God commands we must do; and if we
do it not, we sin; and every sin is (...), that is, 1 Ioh. 3. 4.
a transgression of the Law.

IX. Our third reason. If Christ by his conformity to the Law fulfilled the Law
for us, then his obedience in fulfilling of the Law is Thirdly, because Christ
bis obedience is accepted for u^.
accepted of God in our behalf, as if we had fulfilled it in our own
persons: but Christ by his conformity to the Law fulfilled the Law for us;
therefore his obedience in fulfilling of the Law is accepted of God in our
behalf, as if we had fulfilled it in our own persons; that is to say, both
his habitual and actual righteousness is imputed to us. The consequence of
the proposition is necessary, for if he performed obedience for us and in our
behalf; he performed it in vain, if it be not accepted for us and in our
behalf. The assumption also is of necessary truth; for first, that Christ did
fulfill the Law it is evident, for himself professes, that he came to fulfill
the Law, Matthew. 5. 17. that it became Matthew. 5. 17. 3. 15. Ioh. 8. 29.
him to fulfill all righteousness, Matthew. 3. 15. that he did always those
things which please God, Ioh. 8. 29. and the Scripture testifies, that not for
himself but for us he fulfilled (...), Romans 5. 18. 8. 4.
whatsoever the Law requires to justification: that his whole life was a
perpetual course of obedience, Phil. 2. 8.
(...), even until his death; which he performed not for himself; for as he
was incarnate, not for himself, but for us men and for our salvation, (for it
was the exinanition Phil. 2. 7.
of himself) so being incarnate, he sanctificed Ioh. 17. 15.
himself for us, and was made under the Gal. 4. 5.
Law, not for himself, for that was a farther degree of humiliation; that
being man he humbled himself to be obedient, Phil. 2. 8. Romans 10. 4.
even until his death, and therein also humbled himself to undergo the death
of the cross. The Apostle Romans 10. 4. teaches, that Christ is the end, that
is, the perfection (...), as the Greek Fathers speak; that is, complement of
the Law to all that believe unto righteousness, that is, that he has
fulfilled the Law for all believers, in so much that all who truly believe,
have in Christ fulfilled the Law. Upon which place Remigius writing says,
Christus fin^ ^gis, in completio legis, Christ the end of the Chrysostom. in Romans
10. 4.
Law, that is, the fulfilling of the Law; Theodoret. He that believes in our
Lord Christ, he has fulfilled the scope of the Law, and what that is
Chrysostom shows. For, says he, What did the Law intend? To make a man
just, but it was not (...).
able, for never any fulfilled it; but this end our Savior Christ has (...).
more amply accomplished through faith, if therefore (...).
thou beleevest in Christ, the have not only fulfilled the Law, but much more
than it commanded, for thou have received a far greater righteousness, and
what can that be, but the righteousness of Christ? And Photias, (...).
whosoever therefore, says the Apostle, believes in Christ, he fulfilleth
the Law. Sedulius likewise, Perfectionem habet Legis, qui credit in Christum.
he has the perfection of the Law, who believes in Christ. This therefore
does plainly prove, that Christ's obedience in fulfilling the Law is imputed to
all that believe unto righteousness, as if themselves had fulfilled it. And
this is the conceived doctrine of the Church of England, Homil. of salvation.
part. 1.
that Christ satisfied the justice of God and redeemed us, not only by the
oblation of his body and shedding of his blood, but also by the full and
perfect fulfilling of the Law, and the same was taught by I^st. lib. 2. cap.
16.. 5.
Calvin (not to mention all the rest of our Divines) Christum sc. nos
reconciliasse Deo, and justitiam acquisivisse toto obedientiae suae cursu.

. X. But against this assumption diverse things are objected: Object. 1. That
Christ obeyed the Law not for us, but for himse^fe.
first, they fear not to say (which I fear to relate,) that Christ obeyed the
Law not for us, but for himself: for they say, that Christ, as he was man, was
bound to obey the Law for himself; which assertion detracteth from the merit
of his obedience, from the bounty of his Grace, from the dignity of his person.
From his merit; for if his obedience were of duty, then were it not
meritorious, as himself teaches, Luke 17. 10. for Debitum non est meritum.
And if this be true, that Christ's Luke 17. 10.
obedience is not meritorious, than have we no title to heaven. From his
bounty; if what he did indeed for us, and not for himself, he should be
thought to have done for himself, and not for us. From the dignity of his
person; as if either he needed to obey for himself, or by his obedience he
were any way bettered in himself or improved. But these men should have
remembered, that the person, who (as both of us confess) did obey the Law, was
and is not only man but God also, and therefore, as his blood was Gods blood,
Act. ^0. 28.
so his obedience was the obedience Phil. 2. 6, 8.
of God; and consequently was performed not of duty, nor for himself. For if
of duty, then had God been a debtor to the Law: Neither needed the humane
nature, being by personal union united to the divine, to obey, or to merit for
it self; seeing from the first moment of the conception thereof, it was
personally united to the Deity of the Son of God, in whose person it
subsisting was, from the beginning of the being thereof, most happy, and
enjoying the beatificall vision, being at that time, as the Schoolmen speak
both viator and comprehensor. Neither did the humane nature, which does not
subsist by it self, work any thing by it self in the work of our redemption,
but God manifested 1 Timothy 3. 16.
in the flesh, did in and by it both obey and suffer for us. And as the
eternal Son of God, being God coequall with the Father, assumed the humane
nature and became man, not for himself, for his incarnation was an (...).
Phil. 2. 7.
abasing of himself, as it were, to nothing (for man compared to God is as
Esaias 40. 17.
nothing, if not as less than nothing) but for us men and for our salvation:
so being man, whatsoever he did or suffered in obedience to God, was not for
himself (for it was a further Phil. 2. 8.
debasing of himself) but for us: and as for us he sanctified himself, John
17. 17. so for us he performed all righteousness, Matthew. 3. 15. and fulfilled
the Law for us, Matthew. 5. 17. that whatsoever the Law requires to
justification might be fulfilled Object. 2. Of the Papists
in it, Romans 8. 4.

. XI. But here the Papists object, R^mists in Phil. 2. Sect. 1. That Christ
merited for himself. Phil. 2. 9.
that our Savior Christ by his humiliation did merit his exaltation; because
the Apostle says, that therefore God exalted him, Phil. 2. 9. Answer. In
every aetiologie the reason, which is rendered, is in a large sense called the
cause, though it may be any other argument, which is not the cause of the
Consequent, but of the consequence; as here, humiliation was not the cause, but
the way to exaltation: and exaltation not the effect; but the consequent, as
Luke 24. 26.
it is said, Luke 24. 26. ought not Christ to suffer these things and so to
enter to his glory? And this appears by the scope of the Apostle in that
place; which is to exhort us to the imitation Phil. 2. 3, 4. 5.
of our Savior Christ his charity and humility. Of his charity, in that he
being God, for our sakes became man; and being man ver. 6, 7, 8. verse. 9.
humbled himself further, and became obedient until his death, even the death
of the cross. Of his humility, in that it was the way to his glory. For before
honor Prove. 15. 33. 18. 12.
is humility, and he that humbles himself shall be exalted. But humiliation
is so far from being the cause of exaltation, that it is the contrary Luke
18. 14.
to it; even as corruption to generation, and loss to recovery, yet because
recovery presupposes loss, and the generation of one the corruption of
another, and the exaltation of the Son of God, his foregoing humiliation:
therefore each of these may be said to be causa sine qua non, as all necessary
forerunners may, though they be no causes: Even as Fabius, when Livius
Salinator bad him remember, that by his means he had recovered (...); Why
should I not remember it, says he, I had never recovered it, unless thou
hadd^st lost it, Cic. 2. de Oratore.

And further I add, that the exaltation of Christ, whereof the Apostle Phil.
2. 9.
speaks, was not the exaltation of him to be the Son of God; for that he
was from all eternity, but the manifestation thereof. For although in respect
of Christ's resurrection, Act 13 33. Psalm. 2. 7. Heb. 1. 5.
especially it be said, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee; yet
was not Christ then first begotten, whose generation is eternal; but then he
was mightily declared to be the Son of God by his resurrection, Romans 1. 4.
and Romans 1. 4.
this was that name above all names, which God did give unto him after his
humiliation, his manifesting and declaring him by his resurrection to be the
Son of God. So the Apostle says, Heb. 1. 4, 5. that Christ Heb. 1. 4, 5.
has obtained a more excellent name than the Angels: For unto which of the
Angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day I have begotten thee?
This exaltation was a necessary consequent of his humiliation, and that in two
respects; first, for avoiding the scandal of the cross, for having taken upon
him the form of a servant, and therein having humbled himself to become
obedient until death, and to the death of the cross; it was necessary, lest
men should take offense at his great humiliation, and refuse to believe in a
man that had been crucified, that he should mightily be declared to be the
Son of God by his resurrection, ascension, and sitting at the right hand of
his Father; secondly, this declaration of Christ to be the Son of God was to
follow his humiliation as a necessary stay of our faith in Christ, for if
Christ had not risen again; 1 Cor. 15. 14. 17.
then had our faith been vain, and we had remained in our sins. But by his
resurrection and exaltation, whereby he was powerfully declared to be the
eternal Son of God; we understand, that the obedience, which he had
performed, and the suffering which he sustained for us, were not the obedience
and sufferings of m^re a man, but of him that is God; for which cause Saint
Peter says, that God did raise him and give him glory, that our faith 1 Pet.
1. 21.
and hope might be in God.

. XII. If they will needs with the Arrians See Cyril. Thesaur. lib. 3. cap. 2.

understand the place of Christ's exaltation it self, which is his filiation,
and not of the declaration thereof; thereupon it will follow, that Christ by
his obedience and sufferings in the humane nature, had merited to be God; but
this he had not by purchase, but by nature, and therefore himself prayed a
little before his death, Ioh. 17. 5. And now Father glorify me with the Ioh.

glory, (not which I have merited by my death, but with that glory) which I had
with thee before the world wa^. And it is evident, that the glory whereunto
Christ in this place is said to be exalted, is proper to God himself, Esaias 45.
22. And this may suffice for this point, for I will not Esaias 45. 22.
trouble the Reader with those two other allegations of our Rhemists, the one
out of Apoc. 5. 12. that the Lamb which was slain, was worthy Apoc. 5. 12.
to receive power and (as they read) Divinity: from whence they should prove,
if they prove any thing, that Christ by his sufferings in his humanity, merited
his Divinity. The other, Heb. 2. 9. that Christ, Heb. 2. 9.
because of the passion of death, was crowned with glory and honor: where the
words are thus to be construed, according to the distinction and interpretation
of the Sea D. Fulke in his answer to the Rhemists Heb. 2. 9.
Fathers: we see Jesus crowned with glory and honor, who for a shor^ time was
made less than the Angels ( viz. by hi^ incarna^ion) for the suffering of
death (that is,) that he might suffer death; or as the Apostle speaks, that
by the grace of God he might ( viz. in the humane nature assumed,) taste of
death for all.

must have an (...) desire, an unsained purpose, a serious care, an upright
endeavor to walk in the obedience of Gods commandments, in this study and
practice of piety consists our new obedience, which we must be careful to
perform, not to be justified thereby, but to glorify God, to obey his will,
to restifie our thankfulness toward him, to edify our brethren; to gather
sound testimonies to our selves and assurance of our 2 Pet. 1. 10.
justification; and so to make our calling and our election sure. Object. 4. If

conformable to the commandments alone, because we are all sinners, nor by
suffering the punishment alone, but by both. And therefore Christ performed
both for us, that by both we might be justified. But this objection I will
requite with

death and passion of Christ only, to what end and purpose serves his
habitual righteousness and actual obedience, by which he was obedient to
the Law in the whole course of his life, doing always those things which are

pleasing to God, performing Matthew. 3. 15.
all righteousness, fulfilling Matthew. 5. 17.
the Law, and whatsoever the Law Romans 8. 4.
requires to justification? These things, as I showed before, he did not for
himself, therefore for us and in our stead. To this some of our aforesaid
Divines do answer, that Christ indeed fulfilled the Law for our sakes: but
they put a difference between pro and propter, saying, that Christ obeyed the
Law pro se, not pro nobis, sed propter nos, that is, for our sakes, but not for
us, or in our stead, which some express thus, that he might be sanctus
Pon^ifex, and sacra Victima, an holy Priest and an holy Sacrifice. Others thus,
that these things are required in Christ, that in his blood he may be
righteousness unto us. Answ. 1. That there is no such distinction in the
Scriptures, but the words, (...), in this very point of Christ's doing or
suffering for us, are used indifferently: (...), 1 Cor. 8. 11. (...), Ioh. 17.

1 Ioh. 2. 2. (...), Matthew. 20. 28. Mark. 10. 45. Neither is this distinction
acknowledged by the Fathers, who acknowledge that Christ obeyed pro nobis.

was baptized pro nobis: Aug. tract. 4. in Joan. and tract. 111. that he who
dyed for us, lives pro nobis. Cyril. Thesaur. lib. 9. cap. 2. That he was made
a Priest pro nobis. Idem in Joan. lib. 2. cap. 1. pro omnibus mortuus, pro
omnibus resurrexit, etc. Answ. 2. This to me seems but a shallow conceit. For
who is the Priest, and what is the Sacrifice? Was not the Priest the Son of
God, both God and Man? Was not the Sacrifice the flesh or human nature of the
Son of God? Surely, if Christ had never submitted himself to obey the Law, yet
he being God, had been a most holy Priest; his body and blood being the body
and blood of God, had been a most holy and all-sufficient Sacrifice. Neither
was it the holiness of the humanity that sanctified the sacrifice, or gave the
virtue of satisfaction unto it; but the dignity of the person, and the virtue
of the Godhead, which made the righteousness of the Man Christ, as well active
as passive, to be meritorious and satisfactory for others. Jesus Christ
therefore being both God and Man, was and is our high Priest, who offered the
sacrifice of his humanity upon the altar of his Deity, which sanctified the
sacrifice and made it an all-sufficient satisfaction for the sins of all that
believe. It is the Spirit, says our Savior Christ, that gives life, the
flesh (by it self) profits nothing, Ioh. 6. 63. the sufferings or obedience
of Christ, as he is Man, Ioh. 6. 63.
considered apart from the Godhead, are neither satisfactory nor meritorious
for others; but being the sufferings of God, they are a sufficient price of
ransom to free us from hell; and being the obedience of God, is of sufficient
merit to entitle us unto the kingdom of heaven.

. XVI. Our fifth reason. There are two parts of justification, the Our fifth
reason: that there are two parts of justification.
one, the absolving from the guilt of sin and damnation; the other, the
accepting of a believing sinner, as righteous unto life: the former, is wrought
by the sufferings of Christ imputed, as a full satisfaction for sin; the
other, by imputation of Christ's perfect obedience, as a sufficient merit of
eternal life: by the former we are freed from hell, by the latter we are
entitled to the kingdom of heaven. Of them both the Romans 5. 9. 19.
Apostle speaks, Romans 5. that we are justified, that is, absolved from our
sin, by the blood of Christ. v. 9. and that we are justified, that is,
constituted just by his obedience, verse. 19. To this argument they answer by
denying the antecedent; saying, that there are no parts of justification, but
that it wholly consists in remission of sins. Indeed if it were the only
matter of justification, as some of them teach, and the entire formal cause of
justification, as others avouch, of whom we shall speak in the next Chapter; I
say, if both these opinions were true, then I would confess, that the whole
nature of justification does consist in forgiveness of sin; but whiles it is
either, but the matter, as some say; or but the form, as others; or neither of
both, as I avouch: it is a manifest error to say, that justification
consists wholly in remission of sins. Again, in every mutation, though it
be but relative, we must of necessity acknowledge two terms; t^rminum a quo,
and terminum ad quem; the denomination being taken commonly from the terminus
ad quem. As in justification there is a motion or mutation from sin to
justice, (from which term justification has its name) from a state of death
and damnation, to a state of life and Salvation. But if justification be
nothing else but bare remission of sin, then is there in it only a not
imputing of sin; but no acceptance as righteous: a freedom from hell, but
no title to heaven. To this they answer; that to whom sin is not imputed,
righteousness is imputed; and they who are freed from hell, are admitted to
heaven. I do grant, that these things do always concur; but yet they are
not to be confounded, for they differ in themselves, and in their causes, and
in their effects: in themselves, for it is one thing to be acquitted from the
guilt of sin, another thing to be made righteous; as we see daily in the
pardons of malefactors: in their causes, for remission of sin is to be
attributed to Christ's satisfactory, sufferings; the acceptance as righteous
unto life, to Christ's meritorious obedience. In their effects, for by remission
of sin we are freed from hell; and by imputation of Christ's obedience, we
have right unto heaven.

. XVII. If unto justification there be required besides remission Object. Then
there be two formal causes of justification.
of sin, Imputation of righteousness; then there are two formal causes; of
justification. Answ. It follows not, for although there be two t^rmini in
this mutation, yet there is but one action; and this one action is the only
form of justification, viz. imputation of Christ's righteousness; of which are
two effects, which also be the two parts of justification, remission of sin,
and acceptance as righteous; as I said in the definition, that justification
is an action of God, wherein he imputing the righteousness of Christ to a
believing sinner, does not only absolve him from his sins, but also
accepts of him as righteous, and as an heir of eternal life.

. XVIII. Notwithstanding this so evident truth, some of the That justificati.
on does not consist only in remission of sins.
Divines, of whom we spoke, when they would prove justification by the passive
righteousness of Christ only, take this position for granted, that
justification is nothing but remission of sin, and hereupon infer, that
seeing we have remission of sin only by the blood of Christ, we are
justified by his blood only: And to this purpose they allege many testimonies
of Scriptures, affirming that by the blood of Christ and by his death and
passion we have remission of sin; to all which we readily subscribe. But if
there be any other places that seem to ascribe unto the sufferings of Christ
more than remission of sins, as entrance into heaven and salvation, etc. such
places are to be understood by a Synecdoche, putting the chie^e and most
eminent part of his obedience for the whole. Others labor to prove this
assertion, that justification is nothing but remission of sin, by
testimonies, and by reasons; and to this purpose collect a multitude of
testimonies of Protestant Divines, who against the Papists have maintained,
that justification confisteth in remission of sins only. But this assertion,
as hereafter I shall show, is to be understood as spoken in opposition to the
Papists, who unto justification, besides remission of sins, require inward
renovation or sanctification; and therefore their meaning was to exclude from
justification, not imputation of righteousness, which always concurreth in
the same act with remission of sin, and without which there can be no
remission; for by the same act of imputation of Christ's whole and entire
righteousness, we have both remission of sins, and acceptance unto life;
but to exclude renovation a ratione justificationis, from the proper nature of
justification; as if they had said, we are not justified both by remission and
renovation, as the Papists teach, but by remission without renovation; that is,
in their meaning, by remission only: and this is acknowledged by Bellarmine
himself, as hereafter shall be showed. And forasmuch as by remission of sin
we have an imputative righteousness, for to whom the Lord imputes not sin,
to him he imputes righteousness without works, as the Apostle proves, Romans
4. 6, 7. therefore, when it is said, that we are justified by remission Romans 4
6, 7.
only, and not by renovation; it is all one, as if we said, that we are
justified by imputation only, and not by infusion of righteousness. Their
chiese argument, because remission is as well of sins of omission as of
commission.


XIX. Their chief argument to prove their assertion is this. Remission is as
well of the sins of omission as of commission. As therefore he, whose sins
of commission are remitted, is reputed, as if he had done nothing forbidden:
so whose sins of omission are remitted, is reputed, as if he had left undone
nothing that is commanded. Now he that is reputed as if he had neither done
any thing forbidden, nor left undone any thing that is commanded; he is
reputed, as if he had fulfilled the whole Law.

I answer by distinction, if they consider remission of sins barely without
imputation of righteousness (as they must, if they will make good their
assertion) then he that has only remission of the sins both of commission
and omission, is freed from the guilt of both, but not from the fault. For
notwithstanding such remission of his sins, he is a sinner, as having both
committed what is forbidden, and also omitted what is commanded. Yet by
remission or not imputation of sin he is freed from the punishment, and a
r^atu poenae, from the guilt binding over to punishment, as if he had neither
committed any thing forbidden, nor omitted any thing commanded. He therefore
that h^th remission is reputed, as having neither committed any evil, nor
omitted any good; not simply or absolutely, but in respect of the punishment,
and the guilt which binds over to punishment. As for example, a male^actour
being convicted of Felony, is by the Kings pardon acquitted both from the
punishment and the guilt binding him over to punishment; but yet
notwithstanding his fault remains, and for all his pardon he is a thief.
But if they conceive of remission of sinn^, as having the imputation of
righteousness concurring with it, as always it happens in Gods
justification of a sinner; then it is true, that he^ to whom his sins are
remitted, that is, to whom sin is not imputed, and righteousness is imputed,
is reputed simply and absolutely, as if he had neither committed any thing
forbidden, nor omitted any thing commanded, but as if he had fulfilled the
whole Law. For it is not in Gods pardon as it is in men's: A man by his pardon
may remit the punishment and the guilt binding over to punishment; but he
cannot take away the fault, neither can he by his pardon, make the offender
just. But whom God does justify, he makes them righteous by imputation of
Christ's righteousness, whereby he does not only free them from the guilt of
sin and damnation; but also covering their fault he accepts, ye^
constituteth them righteous and heirs of eternal life. For Gods judgment is
according to truth, and therefore he justifies none but such as are just,
though not by righteousness inherent, for so none Psalm. ^43. 2. Gal. 2. 16.
are or can be justified, yet by righteousness imputed. Justification
therefore is not only an acqui^ing of a sinner from punishment by the not
imputing of sin, but also an acc^pting of him to life by imputation of
perfect righteousness: not only a freeing of a man from hell, but also the
entituling of him to (...): not only a forgiving of our debt, which Christ our
surety has paid for us, but also an enriching of us with the inestimabl^ (...)
of Christ's most p^fect righteousness.

XX. To this argument some do add a second not unlike, whosoever Object. By
remission we are made innocent and therefore just.
are innocent they are just; by remission of sins men are innocent; therefore
by remission of sins men are just. Answ. The proposition is not generally and
necessarily true, for we may conceive a man to be innocent, who is not just:
for innocence is but an absence of sin, not importing a presence of
righteousness. Infants if they were clear from original sin, were
innocent, but not just. To the assumption, I answer, that by the bare remission
of sins without imputation of righteousness men are not innocent: for bare
remission is like to a Kings pardon, which takes away the punishment, but not
the fault. But if they speak of remission of sin accompanied with imputation
of Christ's righteousness, then I will confess, that by remission of sin men
are made both innocent and just. But that righteousness imputed which shall
make a man just, must not stand in suffering only, but in an universal
conformity with the Law of God. You have heard our arguments, and their
answers: now let us examine their proofs.

XXI. The principal author of this Novelty has three arguments. Three
arguments of I. P.
The first is this; Whereby we have entrance into heaven, thereby 1
alone we are justified: by the blood of Christ we have entrance into heaven;
therefore by the blood of Christ alone we are justified. Answ. The proposition
if it had been propounded thus, by what we have entrance into heaven, by that
we are justified; or thus, by what alone we have entrance into heaven, by that
alone we are justified, had been true; but as it is propounded, it is false:
for we have entrance into heaven by his resurrection, ascension, and
intercession, (not to speak of his obedience, by which notwithstanding we are
as the Apostle says, justified, and entitled to heaven) yet we are not
justified by any of these alone. If his meaning be that by the blood alone of
Christ we have entrance into heaven, the assumption also is false, unless he
either by a Synecdoche do under one principal include all the merits of
Christ, or exclude all other means out of Christ, who is our only Savior.

His second argument, Sablata privatione ponitur habitus, therefore sin being
remitted and taken away, justice follows of its own accord. 2
To which I answer briefly, that neither the punishment, nor the guilt, which
only (as themselves teach) are taken away in justification, are privations,
nor the justice which is acquired is an habit in the party justified: and
therefore that Logical Axiom does not serve his turn.

His third argument; If we are justified only by remission of sins, 3
then not by that righteousness which is in Christ: but we are justified only
by remission of sins. Answ. The consequence of the proposition is unsound,
for although we were justified by remission of sins alone; yet we were
justified by imputation of Christ's passive obedience, at the least, unto
remission of sins. The assumption he proves, first, by this reason; because
otherwise our sins being remitted, we should still remain accursed. Answ.
It follows not, for together with remission of sins by imputation of
Christ's sufferings, concurreth acceptance unto life by imputation of Christ's
obedience, without which we could not be said to have fulfilled the Law in
Christ. Secondly, by the authority of Calvin, whom in this case these men abuse
worse than the Papists. For Bellarmine De justis l. 2. c. 6
, though he object against Calvin, as these men do, that he places
justification only in remission of sins; yet he consesseth De justis. l. 2.
c. 1
, that his meaning thereby was not to exclude imputation of Christ's
righteousness, but renovation or sanctification. And he cites these words out
of Lib. 3. c. 11. sect. 2.
Calvin's institutions, that he places justification in peccatorum remissione,
and justitiae Christi imputatione, in the remission of sins, and imputation
of Christ's righteousness. And again Sect. 3.
, that God, when he does justify us, he does absolve us by imputation of
righteousness, that in Christ we may be accepted as just, who in our selves
are not. Wherefore, says he, when Calvin in the same Chapter,. 21. and 22.
and in his Antidote unto the Council of Trent, Sess. 6. does contend, that
justification consists only in remission of sins; he does not exclude the
imputation of Christ's righteousness, but inward renovation and sanctification.
The same Bellarmine confesses De justif. l. 2. c. 1. and 6.
, that those whom he calls Lutherans. (who indeed are very sound in this
point) do all of them place justification in the imputation of Christ's
righteousness, which assertion of theirs is most true, because by imputation
of Christ's righteousness we have not only remission o^ sins, but also
acceptance unto life, as being righteous in Christ; not only freedom from
hell, but also right and title to the Kingdom of Heaven.

XXII. Another treating of this point, affirms, that Christ is the The
arguments of J. F.
matter of our justification, and is made righteousness unto us in his passive
obedience only; and yet confesses, that both the holiness of his person and
the obedience of his life are necessarily required, that he might be meet to
become our righteousness in his sufferings. But this is frivolous: because, as
I noted before, he being perfect God, as well as perfect man, had been in his
sufferings an All-sufficient satisfaction for our sins, though he had never
submitted himself to the obedience of the Law. But the divine Nature of the
Son of God, and the dignity of his person, as it made his sufferings
all-sufficiently satisfactory for our sins, to redeem us from hell, because
they were the sufferings of God, the blood of God, etc. so it made his
obedience all-sufficiently meritorious to constitute and make us righteous, and
to make us Heirs of Eternal life; because it was the obedience or
righteousness of God. For the Son of God was made under Gal. 4. 4, 5.
the Law, that he might not only redeem us, who were under the Law, by his
sufferings; but also that by his meritorious obedience we might receive the
Adoption of sons. But he proves Christ to be our righteousness only in
his passive obedience, because it only was both prefigured in the types and
figures of the Law, and also represented in the sacraments. As touching the
types and figures of the Law which prefigured Christ; they were either figures
of his person and office, or they represented his benefits, as namely and
especially justification or ^anctification. And those, which figured his
benefit of justification, either represented the remission of sin by his
sufferings; or acceptance with God by his obedience, or both. The ceremony of
Genesis 35. 2. Z^ch. 3. 4.
changing their clothes, when they were to come before God, did import that
those who desired to please God, must be clothed with Christ's righteousness,
which is also signified by the wedding Mat. 22. 11, 12.
garment, and the holy attire, wherein the Priests were to appear before God
Exodus 28. 43.
The high Priests wearing of the golden plate with this inscription Exodus 28.
36. 38
Holiness of the Lord, (who is Jehovah I^r. 23. 6.
our righteousness) was to this end, that the iniquity of the holy things,
which the children of Israel should hallow, in all their holy gifts, being
taken away, they might be accepted before the Lord. The high Priests offering
of incense upon the golden Altar, resembled the pleasing obedience of Christ in
his life and death, and his intercession for us. The Arc of the Covenant was a
Type of Christ the Mediator; the cover upon it, of his propitiation; the tables
of Covenant within it, of his fulfilling the Law for us. The sanctification of
the first fruits, which were a type of Christ (who is the first fruits of all
that shall be saved, 1 Cor. 15. 23.) was imputed to the whole increase or
store, Romans 11. 16. So ^aith Athan^s. tom. 2 advers. eos qui negant Christum ^x
natura no^ra s^mpsisse primitias.
Athanasius, (...); That the fulfilling of the Law performed by the first
fruits (so he calls the flesh of Christ) is imputed to the whole lump, etc.

XXIII. But come we to the Sacraments, which he truly says Whether the
passive obedience of Christ only, be represented in the Sacraments.
are the souls of that righteousness Romans 4. 11.
which is by Faith. And yet, says he, Baptism signifies only the washing of
the soul by the blood of Christ; the Eucharist represents only his body
broken, and his blood shed for our sins. Answ. Though some parts only of the
benefits of Christ are represented in the several Sacraments; yet the
substance of each Sacrament is the participation of Christ wholly with all his
merits and benefits. Thus in Baptism we are incorporated into Christ, and in
it we put on Gal. 3. 27.
Christ, who is our righteousness. And it is the Sacrament, not only of
remission of sin and of justification, but also of regeneration and
sanctification, we being therein conformed to his death and resurrection, Romans
6. 3, 4, 5. In the Lords Supper we have communion with Christ, being not only
united to him as Ephesians. 5. 30.
bone of his bone, and flesh of his flesh; but also have communion with him
both in his merits by imputation, and in his graces by influence from him as
our head. Other arguments are used by the same author; but because in them he
takes two things for granted, which he cannot prove; the one, that
justification consists only in remission of sin; the other, that we ascribe
remission of sin to Christ's active obedience, I will not trouble the Reader
with them. Only let him call to mind the errors which the Authors of this
opinion do run into for the defense thereof. First, that remission of sins
is the matter of justification which is imputed to us. Secondly, that the Law
is fully satisfied by bearing the penalty alone. Thirdly, that by one act of
obedience we are made just, as we were by one act of disobedience made
sinners. Fourthly, that neither by his disobedience Ad^m did transgress the
Law, nor Christ by his obedience unto death, obey it. Fifthly, that Christ
obeyed the law not for us, but for himself. Sixthly, that justification
consists wholly and only in remission of sins. Which being for the most
part consequents of this opinion, do prove the antecedent to be false.

CAP. V. That the formal cause of Justification is the imputation of Christ's
Righteousness.
. I.

YOu have heard the private opinions of some of our Divines Private opinions
concerning the form of justification.
concerning the matter of justification: now let us examine the unsound
opinions of some others concerning the form. For as the former made remission
of sins the matter, which is imputed to justification; so these make it the
form. And as the former teach, that justification consists wholly in
remission of sin, so do these. And yet the former hold it to be but the
matter; and these, but the form. Indeed if it were both the matter and the
form, they might well say, that justification does wholly consist therein. But
being, according to their own conceit, but the one, or the other, and
according to the truth, neither of both, but an effect of the true form (for
by imputation of righteousness we have remission of sin) their opinion must
needs be unsound. But the thing wherein chiefly they err is, that with Disp.
de^. C^r. (...). 4 part. c. 4. Christi justitiam nobis imputari est m^rum
commentum.
Socinu^ the heretic they deny the imputation of Christ's Righteousness; and
consequently do hold, that neither the active nor passive obedience of Christ
is that, which is imputed to us for righteousness. What then? forsooth the act
of faith. Of these men's error I shall not need to say much in this place:
because, besides that, which has already been delivered in the third Chapter,
I have plentifully and fully proved in my whole fourth book, that the
righteousness of Christ, is the matter which is imputed to justification; and
in my whole fifth book, that the imputation of Christ's righteousness is the
form of justification. Only I will note their depravation of our Doctrine, and
point at their errors.

II. As touching the former: when we say, that the imputation of Their
depraving of our Doctrine.
Christ's righteousness is the formal cause of justification, because by
imputation of Christ's righteousness God does justify us: they will Bellarm.
de just. l. 2. c. 7.. quart.
needs, with the Papists, make us hold, that we are formally righteous by that
righteousness, which is not in us, but out of us in Christ; which is absurd:
for as themselves expound the phrase A. W. page 180. n. 4.
, Formal justice consists either in the qualities of the soul, or in good
actions (that is, it is either habitual or actual) so that it cannot stand in
imputation; by which we can no more be just formally, than wife, rich, alive,
by imputation of wisdom, riches, and life. Wherefore I marvel how they could
be so absurd, as to conceive so absurdly of us. But we teach, that Christ's
righteousness, both habitual and actual, by which he was formally just, is
the matter; and the imputation thereof is the form of justification. And so
those very Authors, upon whom they would father this assertion, in express
terms do teach; affirming, that Christ's obedience, or fulfilling of the Law

formal cause of justification. We say then, that the righteousness of Christ
it self is not the formal cause of justification, or that by which we are
formally just; but the imputation of it; it self being the matter of
justification; that is to say, that thing, which unto justification is imputed.
Wherefore I shall not need to answer, in defense of our assertion, the
arguments, either of those Veteratores, the Papists, or these Novatores, who
both agree in this calumniation against us, all tending to prove, that we are
not formally ju^ by that righteousness of Christ, which is out of us in him:
which we do not hold. For the righteousness, whereby a man is forma^ly just,
is inherent in himself: for what is more intrinsecall than the form? But
Christ's righteousness is not inherent in us, no more than our sin was
inherent in him. And yet, as he was made sin or a sinner by our sins, not
formally, (God forbid!) but by imputation: so we are made righteous by his
righteousness, not formally (as we are justified) or in our selves, but in
him, viz. by imputation. And again, as by Adams actual transgr^ssion, which
was transient, and now has no being, we are made sinners, that is, guilty of
sin and damnation by imputation of his disobedience: so likewise by Christ's
obedience, which he performed in the days of his flesh, and was proper to his
own person, we are justified, that is, not only freed from the guilt of sin
and damnation, but also constituted just, and entitled to the Kingdom of
Heaven. And yet we deny not, but that, as they to whom the guilt of Adams
transgression is imputed, are also by sin inherent transfused from him by
carnal generation formally made sinners: so they, to whom the obedience of
Christ is imputed unto justification, are also made formally just by an
inchoated righteousness received by influence from Christ, and infused by his
spirit in their spiritual regeneration.

III. In their opinion it self denying the imputation of Christ's Their own
errors, which besides the principal, are six.
righteousness to justification they err more dangerously than the Papists,
who are forced to confess the imputation of Christ's satisfaction: for the
maintenance of this maine error they hold six others. First, that remission
of sin is the entire form or formal cause of justification. Secondly, that
justification is nothing else but remission of sin. Thirdly, that no other
righteousness concurreth to justification besides the remission of sin, no
not the righteousness of Christ, otherwise than it does merit remission of
sin. Fourthly, that the righteousness, by which we are justified, is not the
righteousness of Christ it self, but a righteousness purchased by the death
of Christ, viz. remission of sin. Fifthly, that not the obedience of Christ
it self is imputed whether active or passive, but the merit thereof. Sixthly,
that not the righteousness of Christ, but the act of faith is imputed for
righteousness. All which before I saw the book wherein these errors are
broached, I had plainly and fully confuted in this Treatise.

IV. For as touching the two first, and the maine error it self; The two
first of the six.
I have proved, both in the third Chapter of this book Lib. 1. c. 3.. 7. etc.
briefly, and in the whole fifth book at large, that the form of
justification is the imputation of Christ's righteousness; by which we are both
absolved from our sins, and also are in Christ accepted and made righteous;
and consequently, that these two are the essential parts of Lib. 1. c. 4.. 16.
etc. 6..
justification, viz. the not imputing or remission of sin, which God does
grant by imputation of Christ's sufferings, in respect whereof we are said to
be justified by his Romans 5. 9.
blood; that is, freed from the guilt of sin and damnation; and the
imputation of Christ's Romans 5. 19.
obedience; by which we are made or constituted righteous, and are entitled
to the kingdom of Heaven. So that remission of sin is not the form, and
much less the entire form of justification, considered as an action of God;
but an effect of the form, because by imputation of Christ's righteousness we
have remission of sin. Neither is it the whole benefit of justification, but
a part thereof. For although many of our Divines, as has been said, have
taught, that unto justification remission of sins is only required: yet
their assertion, as has also been showed, is to be understood (as Bellarmine
himself understands Calvin) as spoken in opposition to the Papists; who say,
that to justification concur, not only remission of sins, but also inward
renovation or sanctification. To contradict them, our Divines have said, that
we are justified by remission only or not imputing of sin, (wherewith
always concurreth imputation of righteousness,) and not by renovation or
sanctification. Their meaning therefore by the exclusive particle only, was to
exclude, not imputation of righteousness, which unseparably accompanies the
not imputing of sin, as Saint Paul proves, Romans 4. Romans 4. 6. 8.
6. 8. and Bellarmine himself confesses; but infusion of righteousness or
renovation.

V. The third is the same in effect with that which I fully confuted, The third
error
Cap. 4. and contradicts their own assertion, who teach with us, that we are
justified by the whole course of Christ's obedience: for remission of sin is
properly ascribed to Christ's sufferings or his blood 1 Job. 1. 7.
which cleanses us from all our sins; and not to his active obedience. And
justification is nothing, as they say, but remission of sin: whereupon it
would follow, that we are justified only by Chri^ts passive obedience, which I
have already disproved. The fourth error.


VI. The fourth, denying the righteousness of Christ it self to be our
righteousness, I have fully confuted in the fourth book: besides that, which
has already been alleged in the third chapter of this book that which is
added concerning a righteousness purchased by the death of Christ, is the same
with that which I confuted, Chap. 4.. 1. for our righteousness is not
remission of sin, but that by which we have remission; not justification it
self, but that by which we are justified. For remission of sin, as well as
justification it self, is an action of God, not imputing sin and imputing
righteousness; and therefore is not that righteousness which is imputed. Thus
therefore I argue; By what we have remission of sin, by that we are
justified, and by what we are justified, that is, our righteousness by the
blood of Christ we have remission of sin, and not by that righteousness
which is purchased by his blood, viz. remission of sin, for that to say were
very ridiculous. Wherefore by the blood of Christ we are justified; and
consequently, that with the res^ of his obedience is our righteousness.

. VII. To the fifth I answer, that the meritorious obedience of The fifth error.
Christ both active and passive are the merits of Christ. If therefore the
merit of Christ be imputed, then his meritorious obedience: Neither can the
merit of Christ's obedience be imputed to us, unless the obedience it self be
imputed, and by imputation accepted of God for us, as performed by our selves.

For as the guilt of Adams transgression could not be imputed to us, unless
the transgression it self were first imputed, and made ours; by imputation
whereof we are made sinners, that is, guilty of his sin unto condemnation:
so the merit of Christ's obedience cannot be imputed, unless the obedience it
self be imputed, and made ours; by imputation whereof we are freed from the
guilt of sin and damnation, and are accepted as righteous, and as heirs of
eternal life. And as it may truly be said of them, to whom Adams disobedience
is imputed, that they sinned in Adam: so of them, to whom Christ's obedience is
imputed, it may no less truly be said, that in Christ they have satisfied the
justice of God, in Christ they have fulfilled the Law; the Lord accepting of
the obedience of Christ in their behalf, as if they had performed it in their
own persons. For Christ is the end, the perfection and complement of the Law
to all that believe. So that whosoever truly believes in Christ, has in him
fulfilled the Law, as the Greek expositors expound that place, Romans 10. 4.
Romans 10. 4.


. VIII. But, say they, we were not so in Christ, when he obeyed, Object. 1.
as we were in Adam, when he sinned. Neither are we members of Christ until
we actually believe. And therefore, neither could we be said to have satisfied
the justice of God for our sins, nor to have fulfilled the Law in him, as we
are truly said to have sinned in Adam. Or if it could be said, that in Christ
we satisfied Gods justice for our sins, then should we need no pardon.
Neither can punishment and pardon stand together if we have borne the
punishment, then are we not pardoned. A^sw. The first Adam was a Romans 5. 14.
type of the second, and both were heads and roots of mankind. Adam, of those
that shall be condemned; Christ, of those that shall be saved. For as in Adam
all dye, 1 Cor. 15. 22.
that dye eternally; so in Christ all live, that live eternally. And as in Adam
Romans 5. 19.
(...) that is, all that shall be condemned were constituted sinners, his
disobedience being imputed to them, because in him they sinned: so in Christ
(...) all that shall be saved, shall be constituted just, his obedience being
imputed to them, because in him, as their head, they have satisfied and
fulfilled the Law. Neither are we more truly derived from Adam in respect of
the life natural, than we are from Christ in respect of the life spiritual.
Therefore if Adams disobedience were imputed to condemnation, much more Christ's
obedience is imputed unto justification of life, as the Apostle Romans 5. 17, 18.
argues Romans 5. and from thence Bernard; Epist. 190. See infr. lib. 5. chap. 4.
Cur non aliunde justitia cum aliunde reatus? alius qui peccatorem constituit;
alius qui justificat a peccato. Alter in semine, alter in sanguine. An peccatum

. IX. Yea but then (say they) when Christ obeyed, we were not Object. 2.
his members: No more (say I) were we the branches of the first Adam, when he
disobeied. Actually, we are neither branches of the first Adam, until we
partake the humane nature by generation; nor members of the second Adam, until

nature by regeneration, and yet it is most true, which Bernard avoucheth in
the place even now cited, satisfecit Epist. 190.
ergo Caput pro membris, etc. the head therefore satisfied for his members, etc.

. X. Yea but our faith relyeth upon Christ, as having already Object. 3.
redeemed us.

Ans. Christ is the Lamb Apoc. 13. 8.
of God slain from the beginning of the world. The virtue of whose obedience
is extended, not only to them that come after Christ; but also to all the
faithful that went before from the beginning of the world, who were members
Their afflictions were the reproach of Christ. Heb. 11. 26. viz. in his members.
of Christ as much as we are now. And for them, as well as for us, Christ
obeyed the Law, and suffered death; and to them (so many as believed) was the
obedience of Christ imputed, Act. 15. 11.
as well as to us. They all did eat the same 1 Cor. 10. 3. 4.
spiritual meat, and did all drink the same spiritual drink. For they
drank of that spiritual Rock which followed, and that Rock was Christ.

. XI. But if in Christ, say they, we satisfied the punishment, then Object. 4
we need no pardon.

Answ. When we say, that in Christ we satisfied and fulfilled the Law, our
meaning is, that his satisfaction and obedience is imputed to us; that is, it
is accepted of God in our behalf, as if we had performed the same in our own
persons. Neither should it seem strange, that satisfaction and pardon may
stand together, seeing God pardons no sin, for which his justice is not
satisfied. But it is Christ that satisfied, and bare the punishment; and we are
they who are pardoned by imputation of his satisfaction unto us. Here therefore
especially mercy and justice met together: justice, executed upon Christ's
mercy, exhibited to us; who are justified by the grace of God freely, Romans 3.
24. 15.
in respect of us, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus: and therefore
not freely in respect of him, who paid so great a price. For him God set forth
to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness
for the remission of sins, etc. But that the righteousness of Christ is the
only thing, which properly is imputed to justification, I have at large
disputed, Lib. 4. and 5.

. XII. The sixth I have already refuted Lib. 1. Cap. 2.. 7. Whereunto I now
add; that these men, confessing the truth with us, that faith The sixth error
is the isntrumental cause of justification, confute themselves. For if it be
the instrument to receive that which is imputed, then is it not the thing it
self which is imputed properly; though relatively it may in respect of the
object, which it, as the instrument or hand, does receive to justification: and
that is the righteousness of Christ. And for this cause, as hereafter Lib. 6.
c. 4. sect. 6.
shall be declared, the same benefits, which we have from Christ properly,
are attributed to faith; not absolutely, in regard of it self; but relatively
in respect of that righteousness, which it does apprehend. If it be said, that
faith as the instrument receives remission of sin, because by it we are
assured thereof: I answer, that by faith receiving Christ we have remission of
sins and justification, before we can by special faith be assured of it. And
it is a great absurdity, as elsewhere Covenant of Grace. cap. 8. page 94. n. 5.
I have showed, to teach, that men must believe, and be assured of the
remission of their sins, to the end that they may be remitted.

. XIII. I shall not need therefore to say any more in this place, A Caveat for
young Divines.
unless it be to give a Caveat to all young Divines, that they give no credit
to these Novelties, which either affirm that we are justified by the passive
righteousness of Christ only; or deny that we are justified by the
righteousness of Christ at all, as the matter of our justification. By Matter
I understand that very thing, which is imputed as our only righteousness; by
which we stand perfectly righteous before God; by imputation whereof, we are
both freed from hell, and also entitled to the kingdom of heaven. And let all
men take notice, that these opinions, howsoever to some they seem matters of
small importance, are notwithstanding very dangerous, if not pernicious; seeing
they concern our very title to the kingdom of heaven, and seeing al^o I have
proved in this Treatise, that without imputation of Christ's The necessity of
imputation of Christ's righteousness.
righteousness there can be no justification, nor salvation. For all will
confess, that without Christ's obedience and sufferings none can be justified
or saved; and that they justify or save none, but them only to whom they are
communicated and applied. But they cannot be communicated otherwise than by
imputation, whereby God accepts them in our behalf, as if we had in our own
persons performed them for our selves. Again, these four assertions I hold
for undoubted truths: first, that what Christ our blessed Savior in the days
of his flesh did or suffered in obedience to God, he did and suffered, not for
himself, but for us: secondly, that whatsoever he did and suffered for us that
believe, that the Lord accepts in the behalf of all that believe: thirdly,
that what he accepts in our behalf that he imputes unto us, for by
imputation we mean nothing else: fourthly, to say, that what Christ did and
suffered for us God does not accept in our behalf, is both blasphemous against
Christ the wisdom of his Father, as if he did and suffered those things,
which he did and suffered in vain: and also pernicious unto us, for if Christ's
doings and sufferings for us be in vain, as they are if they be not imputed
to us; then is our faith vain, and we remain in our sins, and in the
woeful state of damnation.

. XIV. But some will say; it is sufficient to believe, that by the Object.
merits of Christ we have remission of sin, and that having remission of
sins we shall be saved by him. Answ. Yea, but God forgiveth no sins, for
which his justice is not fully satisfied. For as he is merciful, so he is just
in forgiving our sins. But no such satisfaction can be imagined, but that of
Christ. For we our selves are not able to satisfy for our sins, but by
eternal punishment. And how shall we have remission by Christ's satisfaction,
if it be not applied and communicated unto us? how can it be communicated and
made ours, but by imputation? And that the very papists themselves are at
length forced to confess. And where they say, that having remission of sins
they shall be saved: I confess it is true, because with Gods remission of
sins there does always concur imputation of righteousness. But the bare
remission of sin without imputation of righteousness, which only freeth a
man from the guilt of sin and damnation, does not entitle him or give him
right to the kingdom of heaven. It is one thing to have by faith remission of
sins, and another to have by faith inheritance among them that be sanctified,
Act. 26. 18. Eternal life is not to be Act. 26. 18.
had without perfect fulfilling of the Law, which is no where to be found but
only in Christ. And therefore by the only meritorious obedience of Christ, by
which he has merited and purchased salvation for us, we are saved. But how
should we be saved by his obedience, if it be not communicated unto us, and
made ours for our selves? how can it be made ours, but by imputation?
wherefore no imputation of Christ's obedience, no salvation.

CAP. VI. The end or final cause, the essential parts, the fruits and
consequents of justification.
. I.

THE final cause or end, for which God does justify a The end Supreme.
sinner by imputation of Christ's righteousness, is either supreme, or
subordinate. The supreme, is the manifestation of the glory, both of his mercy,
and of his justice (as is noted in the definition) which as they do concur
in all the work of God, Psalm. 145. 17. Psalm. 145. 17.
so especially in the work of redemption and justification. For therein the
mercy of God appears to be so great, that rather than he would suffer us
most miserable sinners to perish in our sins, he has sent his own and his
only begotten Son, that we might be justified Romans 3. 24.
freely by his grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, to the
praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he has made us Ephesians. 1. 6.
accepted in his beloved. His justice also such, that rather than he would
suffer the sins of his own elect to go unpunished, or forgive them without
due satisfaction; he has punished them in his own Son, and exacted from
him a full satisfaction for them: having set him forth Romans 3. 25, 26.
to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness
through the forgiveness of sins, which are past, by the sufferance of God;
to demonstrate, I say, his righteousness at this time, that he might be just
and the justifier of him who believes in Jesus. Not unto us therefore, not
unto us, as if we were justified by our own righteousness or worthiness; but
Psalm. 119. 1.
to the name of God all glory is due for his mercy and for his righteousness
sake; who does justify us, not of works Ephesians. 2. 9. Romans 4. 2.
lest we should glory in our selves: but of his grace, freely, without any
desert or cause in our selves, through the redemption wrought by Christ; who is
of God made righteousness 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31.
unto us, that he which gloryeth may glory in the Lord.

. II. The subordinate end is our salvation, and the way unto it, The

Salvation.
our (...), our particular supreme end and chief good, unto which both
justification and sanctification is referred; yet it is subordinate to the
glory of God, as to the sovereign and universal end. For such is Gods
goodness toward his elect, that he has subordinated our salvation to his
own glory; as he has our justification and sanctification to both. And
therefore, as we are first above all things to desire, that God may be Mat. 6.
9, 10, 11.
glorified; so, that he may be glorified, we are first among those things,
which we desire for our own good, to seek his Mat. 6. 33.
Kingdom, and his righteousness; that his Kingdom of glory, and the Kingdom
of Grace, which consists in the Romans 14. 17.
righteousness of justification, and the two companions thereof peace and joy
in the holy Ghost; may come upon us; and next, that his will may be done upon
earth, as it is in heaven, by our new obedience: for this is the will of God 1
These. 4. 3.
, even our sanctification. Salvation, I say, is the end both of our
justification and sanctification: for being made free from sin* and become
servants to Romans 6. 22.
God, we have our fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life. The end
of our faith by which we are justified, is the 1 Pet. 1. 9.
salvation of our souls, unto which by justification we are entitled, and
Romans 8. 24.
saved in hope that being justified by his Tit. 3. 7.
grace, we should be made heirs according to, hope of eternal life: for all
that be justified, Romans 8. 30.
shall be glorified. And this also I noted in the definition, when I said, that
those whom the Lord does justify by imputation of Christ's righteousness, he
accepts as righteous in Christ, and as heirs of eternal life: for by faith
Act 26. 18.
we have remission of sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified.

III. But we are justified by faith, not only, that in the end we 2.
Certainety of Salvation.
may be saved; but also, that in the mean time our salvation being of Grace,
might be certain and sure: and that being justified Romans 5. 1, 2.
by faith we might have peace and joy in the holy Ghost: Whereas, if it
depended upon our works or worthiness, it would be uncertain. For the
promise of this inheritance was not made to Abraham, and his seed through the
Law, in respect of any righteousness therein prescribed, but through the
righteousness of Faith. And therefore it is of faith, that it might be by
grace, to the end the promise might be sure to all Romans 4. 13, 16.
the seed, Romans 4. 13. 16.

IV. The other end, which is subordinate not only to Gods glory,
Sanctification.
but also to our Salvation, is our sanctification, as being the way to eternal
life: for though we be saved by grace through faith, and not of works; yet we
are the workmanship Ephesians. 2. 8, 9, 10.
of God, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God has before
ordained, that we should walk in them: We are therefore justified, First, that
God may be glorified. Secondly, that we may be saved in the life to come.
Thirdly, that in this world we may lead a godly life. See Luke 1. 74, 75. 1
Pet. 2. 24. Tit. 2. 11, 12, 13. So much of the causes.

V. There remain the essential parts of justification, which I expressed The
parts of justification.
in the definition, when I said, that God does justify a believing sinner,
when imputing unto him the righteousness of Christ, he does absolve him from
his sins, and accepts of him in Christ as righteous, and as an Heir of
Eternal Life.

The parts therefore of justification are two, absolution from sin, and
acceptance as righteous in Christ; both which the Lord grants by imputation
of the full and perfect satisfaction of Christ, whereby he fully satisfied the
Law, both in respect of the penalty, which he satisfied by his sufferings; and
also in respect of the precept, which he satisfied by his perfect
righteousness, both habitual and actual. As therefore there were two
branches of the Law to be satisfied, the commination and the Commandment; and
two parts of Christ's satisfaction answerable thereunto: so there are two parts
of justification, absolution from the curse of the Law, by imputation of
Christ's sufferings, wherein he became a curse for us; and acceptance as
righteous in Christ by imputation of Christ's most perfect righteousness both
habitual and actual: in respect of both which parts of his satisfaction,
Christ is the end of the Law for righteousness Romans 10. 4.
, that is, does justify all that truly believe in him.

VI. And hereby it may appear, that those three benefits of Redemption,
Reconciliation, and Adoption, are all comprehended under Redemption,
reconciliation, adoption comprised under Justification.
this maine benefit of justification; the two former, being all one in
substance with the former part: for as touching the former, In Christ we have
Redemption through his blood Ep 17. Col. 1. 14
, even remission of sins, Ephesians. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14. And as touching the latter;
God was in Christ 2 Cor. 5. 19.
reconciling the world unto himself, not imputing unto them, or remitting
their sins, 2 Cor. 5. 19. and therefore all three, Remission of 1 (...). 2.
7. Heb. 9. 22.
sins, Col. 1. 14. 1 Pet. 1 19.
Redemption, and Romans ^. 10. Col. 1. 20.
Reconciliation are ascribed to the blood and to the death of Christ. The third
is all one in substance with the second part: For what is it to be adopted, but
to be accepted of God Ephesians. 1. 5, 6.
in his beloved as righteous, and as an Heir of Eternal Life? and this is
ascribed to the righteousness and obedience of Christ Romans 5. 19.
both in his life and death. For therefore was the Son of God made under the
Gal. ^. 4, 5.
Law, namely to obey, and to fulfill, and to satisfy it; that he redeeming us
from the yoke of the Law requiring perfect obedience in us to justification, we
might receive the Adoption of sons.

VII. Now follow the consequents and fruits of justification, which The fruits
and consequents o^ Justification.
are the Grace of Sanctification and the parts thereof, consisting partly in
righteousness inherent, and partly in outward obedience called good works:
which I do the rather mention in this place; because the Papists though they
cannot deny, that they are the effects and fruits of justification, which as
they use to allege out of Augustine, Non praecedunt justificandum, sed
sequuntur justificatum, not go before as causes, but follow as effects, yet
notwithstanding most absurdly contend, that they concur with faith unto
justification, as the causes thereof: we acknowledge them to be necessary in
the subject, that is, the party that is justified, and to be saved necessitate
praesentiae, as the necessary fruits and consequents of justification, and as
necessary antecedents to glorification: but we deny their necessity of
efficiencie, as causes concurring to the act of justification, or merit of
salvation: We acknowledge them as the necessary fruits of Redemption and
Justification, as the marks and cognizances of them that shall be saved, the
necessary forerunners of glorification, the only true way to our heavenly
country, the evidence according to which we shall be judged at the last day;
yet we are not justified by them, nor saved for them (as hereafter I shall
plainly and plentifully prove) but only by and for the righteousness and
merits of Christ apprehended by Faith.

A TREATISE OF JUSTIFICATION.
THE SECOND BOOK: That Justification and Sanctification are not to be
confounded.
CAP. I. Setting down the heads of the Controversies: the first whereof is,
that Justification and Sanctification are not to be confounded. The first
proof, because the hebrew word, which signifies to justify, does never
signify to make righteous by infusion of righteousness.
. I.

HAving thus briefly set down the true Doctrine The heads of Controversy.
of Justification according to the Word of God: we are now to confute the
erroneous doctrine of of the Papists. There are six maine and capital errors,
which the Papists most obstinately hold and maintain concerning justification;
and consequently so many principal heads of controversy between us,
whereunto diverse other particular questions are to be reduced. The first
concerning the name; whether justification and sanctification are to be
confounded. The second concerning the moving cause, which is the justifying and
saving Grace of God, which they call gratia gratum faciens. The third
concerning the matter of justification. The fourth concerning the form. The
fifth concerning the isntrumental cause, which is Faith. The sixth concerning
the fruits of faith and consequents of justification, which are good works;
concerning which are two maine questions. First, whether they do justify a
man before God. Secondly, whether they do merit Eternal Life.

II. The first capital error of the Papists is, that they confound The
Papists confound justification and sanctification.
justification and sanctification, and by confounding of them, and of two
benefits making but one, they utterly abolish, as shall be showed, the benefit
of justification; which notwithstanding is the principal benefit, which we
have by Christ in this life, by which we are freed from hell, and entitled to
the Kingdom of Heaven. And this they do in two respects: for first, they
hold, that to justify in this question signifies to make righteous by
righteousness inherent, or by infusion of righteousness, that is, to
sanctify. Secondly, they make remission of sin, not to be the pardoning and
forgiving of sin, but the utter deletion or expulsion of sin by infusion of
righteousness. Thus they make justification wholly to consist in the parts of
sanctification. For whereas Sanctification is partly privative, which is the
taking away of sin, which we, according to the Scriptures call mortification;
and partly positive, which we call vivification; and is partly inward or
habitual, consisting in the habits of Grace infused, and partly actual which
is our new obedience, and practice of good works: all these, and only these
they make to concur to justification: which with them is partly privative,
which they call remission of sin, whereby they understand the utter deletion
or extinction of sin, wrought by infusion of perfect righteousness, which is
an higher degree of mortification, than we can attain unto in this life: and
partly positive, and that either habitual, which they call their first
justification, wherein a man of a sinner is made righteous by infusion of the
habits of Grace, which is indeed regeneration: and partly actual, which they
call their second justification, wherein a righteous man is made more just by
the practice of good works, whereby they merit not only the increase of
righteousness, but also the Crown of Eternal Life.

III. Of this first controversy therefore are two questions: First, The
Papists ground their ^rrour upon the like notation of the Latin words.
whether to justify does signify to make righteous by infusion of
righteousness, which is to sanctify. Secondly, whether remission of sin be
the utter deletion and abolition of sin by infusion of righteousness. In
both the Papists hold the affirmative. The former, which is a most pernicious
error, they ground upon the like notation of the Latin words to justify and
to sanctify. That as to sanctify is to make holy by holiness inherent; so to
justify is to make just by infusion of righteousness. But though the notation
of the Latin words were to be respected; yet no more could be enforced from
thence, but that to justify is to make just. And that is all, which De justif.
lib. 2. cap. 9.
Bellarmine goes about to prove. Now God makes men just two ways: by
imputation, as he justifies: by infusion, as he sanctifies them. For if a man
may be made just, not only inwardly by obtaining righteousness, but also
outwardly by declaration, as De iustif. l. 2. c. 3. s^ct. Ad secundum. Potest
aliquis sieri iustus tum in t^insece per adoptionem iustitiae, tum extrinsece
per declarationem.
Bellarmine himself says; then much more by imputation: even as we were made
sinners by Adams actual transgression, and as Christ was made sin, that is,
a sinner for us. For even as by Adams disobedience we were made sinners and
guilty of damnation, his transgression being imputed to us: so Romans 5. 19.
are we made just by the obedience of Christ imputed to us. And as Christ, who
knew no sin, was made a sinner by imputation of our sins to him; so 2 Cor.
5. 21.
we are made the righteousness of God in him, that is, righteous in him by the
imputation of his righteousness, who is God unto us. But indeed the force of
the Latin words is to be respected no further, than as they are the true
translation of the Hebrew word in the Old Testament, and of the Greek in the
New.

. IV. The Hebrew root Tsadaq, from whence those verbs do spring, The Hebrew
verb in the first conjugation, or in Call.
which signify to justify, is by the Septuagint translated, sometimes (...),
to be just, blameless or pure. (...), to be just, as Job 9. 2. 15. 20. 10. 15.
15. 14. 25. 4. 33. 12. 34. 5. 35. 7. (...) to be blameless, as Job 22. 3.
(...) to be pure, as Job 4. 17. sometimes (...) in the same sense, to be just,
as being a translation not of a passive, but of a Neuter, as Genesis 38. 26. (...)
Thamar is more just than I. So Psalm. 19. 10. j^dicia Dei, (...), Psalm. 51. 6.
(...)* and so Romans 3. 4. Psalm. 143. 2. Esai. 43. 9. cum 41. 26. Ezekiel. 16. 52.
In Ecclus. 18. 1. Deus solus justificabitur, the Greek is, (...). Sometimes
(...), to be reputed just, as Job 11. 2. 13. 18. 40. 3. Sometimes to be
justified and absolved from sin, to be pronounced and accepted as righteous,
as Esai. 43. ^6. Let us plead together, declare thou (...) first thine
iniquities, that thou may be justified, Esai. 45. 25. in the Lord all the
seed of Israel shall be justified.

The passive is only once used Dan. 8. 14. where it is said that the In
Niphal. Nitsdaq.
sanctuary after 2300. days shall be justified, that is expiated or purged.

In the second conjugation it signifies to justify, but not as the word In
Piel. Tsiddeq.
is used in the doctrine of justification: but as it signifies either to
arrogate righteousness to a man's self, as Job 32. 2. or to attribute or
ascribe it to others, as Job ^3. 32. or to show himself or others righteous,
as Ier. 3. 11. Ezekiel. 16. 51, 52.

In the third conjugation it signifies to justify in that sense that the In

question of justification: And it is verbum forense, a judicial word used in
Courts of judgment, which usually is opposed to condemning. And it signifies
to absolve and to acquit from guilt, and accepting a man as righteous, to
pronounce him just, or to give sentence with him. Deuteronomy. 25. 1. If there be a
controversy between men, and they Deuteronomy. 25. 1.

the righteous, and condemn the wicked. Prove. 17. 15. He Prove. 17. 15.

are abomination to the Lord: and so the word is used, 2 Samuel 15. 4. Psalm. 82.
3. Job 27. 5. Esai. 5. 23.

. V. From the Courts of men and from humane Judges this To justify, is a
judicial word translated from Courts of judgment.
word is translated to spiritual judgments, and is attributed to God the
Judge to Christ our Mediator, and Advocate; to Preachers, as they are the
Ambassadors of God in Christ his stead. God is said to justify, when he
absolveth a man from sin or guilt, and pronounces him just, Exodus 23. 7. I
will not justify a wicked man, I will not absolve or acquit him, or hold him
guiltless. 1 King. 8. 32. and 2 Chronicles. 6. 23. Solomon desires the Lord that
he would judge his servants, condemning the wicked to b^ing his way upon his
head, and justifying the righteous, to give him according to his
righteousness. Esai. 50. 8. Christ Esai. 50. 8.
for the comfort of his members argues, as the Apostle does to the Romans 8 33.
like purpose, Romans 8. he is near that justifies me, who will contend with me
-- who is mine adversary -- who shall condemn me? Christ our Savior is also
said to justify, both as our Mediator and surety paying our debt, Esai. 53.
11. (my righteous servant agni^one sui, Esai. 53. 11.
that is, by faith in him shall justify many, and he shall bear their
iniquities) and also as our intercessour and advocate, to plead for us sinners
appealing from the tribunal of justice to the throne of grace, 1 John. 2. 2.
Romans 8. 34. Preachers also are said to justify, Dan. 12. 3. Dan. 12. 3.
both as they are the instruments of the holy Ghost to beget faith in the
souls of the Elect, by which they are justified in the Court of heaven: and
also as they are Ambassadors and Ministers of God to pronounce remission of
sins to them that believe and repent, and so to justify them in the court of
their own Conscience.

There remains the fourth Conjugation importing a reciprocal In Hithpael,
Hitstaddeq.
signification, in which the word is once only used, Genesis 44. 16. how shall we
justify our selves?

. VI. These are all the places wherein I fi^de this word to be The Hebrew word
never signifies to make just by righteousness inherent.
used in the old Testament. By all which it does evidently appear that the
Hebrew word, which signifies to justify, does never signify to make
righteous by infusion of righteousness, or by righteousness inherent: the
which will more clearly appear by the countrary; for as to condemn is to
make wicked; so to justify, is to make just. The word Rashah signifies to be
wicked, as Tsadaq does signify to be just, so Hirshiah, which signifies to
make wicked, is to condemn, as Hitsdiq, which signifies to make just, is to
justify. As therefore they, who are condemned, are said to be made wicked, or
unjust, namely by sentence: so they, who are justified, are said to be made
just, viz. by sentence. But he that condemns the wicked, whether it be God or
man, though he be said, according to the force of the word, to make him wicked;
yet does not make him wicked formally, or by infusion of wickedness inherent.
Therefore, he that justifies a man, whether he be God or man, though he be
said, according to the Etymology of the word, to make him just: yet quatenus
justificat, he does not make him just, as he justifies him, by righteousness
inherent. No more than he that condemns the just does make him formally
wicked; nor he that justifies the wicked does make him formally just; which
if a man should do, it would be no abomination to God, as by he sentence of
Prove. 17. 15.
Solomon to justify the wicked is, but the contrary, Iam. 5. 19, 20. Da^. 12. 3

. VII. And not unlike hereunto is the phrase of cleansing or The like use in
other words.
polluting, that is, making clean or unclean, attributed to the priest in the
Levit. 13. 3. 6. etc.
Law when he was to judge of the Leprosy either in persons or things; which
he was said to make clean or unclean, when he did but judge or pronounce them
so to be. And further, this is to be noted, as a thing usual in the Hebrew
tongue, that the third Conjugation does seem to make that quality or thing,
which is implied in the signification of the first Conjugation, not always
really and formally, but many times in word only, or judgment, sentence, or
conceit. Thus Gadal signifies to be great, Higdil to make great or to
magnify, which is in words to extol, in which sense we are said to magnify
Luke 1. 46.
God, etc. So Aman signifies to be true, Heemin to make true, that is, to
believe, as contrariwise not to believe a man is to make him a liar 1 Ioh. 5.
10.
, and yet a man may believe 2 These. 2. 11.
a lie, which he cannot make true. Thus Rashah signifies to be wicked,
Hirshuah to make wicked by sentence; and so Tsadaq signifies to be just, and
Hitsdiq to make just, namely by sentence. And such is the ordinary use of
diverse Latin and English words of the like composition, as to glorify,
magnify, vilify, nullify (as Herod Luke 23. 1^.
did Christ) and so to justify: for as we are said to justify Luke 7. 29.
God, when we ascribe righteousness unto him, to justify other men, to
justify our selves: So God is said to justify men, when he ascribes or
imputes Romans 4. 6.
righteousness unto them.

CAP. II. The use of the Greek Words signifying to justify, or justification,
never importing inherent justice.
. I.

THE Greek words, which signify to justify and to be The Greek words,
first, (...).
justified, are (...), and (...); from whence are derived, (...), which
signifies justification, and (...), which sometimes also signifies
justification. And of these I am now to speak. (...) and (...) are not in use
among the authors of the Greek tongue, in the sense of justifying or making
just. (...), says Suidas, (...), it signifies two things; to punish (as being
derived from (...), which sometimes signifies punishment) and to think right
or meet: sometimes, both (...) and (...) do signify to condemn, in the
contrary sense to the sacred use of the words: sometimes (...) signifies only
to think, to judge or suppose, and (...) sometime to be righted in judgment.
From profane authors therefore we are not to setch the true meaning of the
words, but from the Septuagints, who translating the Hebrew Text of the old
Testament, do render the Hebrew words, which I spoke of, importing
justification, by these Greek words (...) and (...). And from them not only
the son of Sirach, and other Ecclesiastical authors writing in Greek, but
also the holy Apostles and Evangelists have received the same. And therefore
these words are no otherwise to be understood, than as the translations of the
said Hebrew words, signifying no other thing, than what the Hebrew words
import: which (as I have showed) do never signify to make or to be made
righteous by inherent righteousness.

. II. (...) is used by the Apostle and by the Evangelist Luke, (...)
sometimes as the translation of Tsiddiq in Piel, as Luke 7. 29. the people
Luke 7. 29.
Luke 10 29.
and Publicans (...), justified God. The Lawyer, Luke 10. 29. Luke 16. 15.
willing to justify himself. The Pharisees, Luke 16. 15. justified themselves
before men. And so is the word used sometimes by the son of Sirach, as
Ecclus. 10. 29. who will justify him that sins against his Ecclus. 10. 32.
13. 26.
own soul? Cap. 13. 26. alias 22. A rich man speaks things not to be
spoken, and yet men justify him. Sometimes the Apostle uses the word (...) as
the translation of Hitsdiq, as always he does in the question of
justification, and always as the action of God: as Romans 3. 26. Romans 3. 26. 24
28. 30.
who justifies him that believes in Jesus; how? verse. 24. gratis, without any
cause or desert of justification in the party, without works, that is, without
respect of any righteousness inherent in him, or performed by him, verse. 28.
who justifies the Circumcision and uncircumcision, that is, both Jews and
Gentiles, not of works or by inherent justice, but by and through faith, verse.
30. who justifies the ungodly, that is, Romans 4. 5, 6.
the believing sinner, that works not, Romans 4. 5. and therefore not by
inherent righteousness: how then? by imputing righteousness without works,
verse. 6. who Romans 8. 30. whom he calls he justifies, namely Romans 8. 30, 33.
by faith, and whom he justifies he also glorifieth, using the word in the
same sense, verse. 33. who can lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? it is
God that justifies, who shall condemn? where most manifestly the word is used
as a judicial word, opposed to accusing and condemning. Neither can any color
of reason be alleged why the word in these places should signify contrary to
the perpetual use both of it self, and of the H^brew word, whereof it is a
translation, to make righteous by righteousness inherent.

. III. (...) is used sometimes as the translation not of the passive (...).
verb, but as of the Neuter in Call, as I have showed before out of the Greek
translation of the (...). So Ecclus. 7. 5. be not just before God, not wise
before the king; or as it is usually translated, do Ecclus. 7. 5.
not justify thy self before God. So also in the new Testament. Romans 3. 4.
cited out of Psalm. 51. 6. where the Hebrew word is not a passive, Romans 3 4.
but a neuter. And so Apoc. 22. 11. (...) let him that is Apoc. 22. 11.
just, be just still. As the translation of the passive it is often used. But
as it never signifies to be made just by inherent justice (as I will show,
when I come to answer the objections of the Papists:) so it always
signifies, either to be declared or pronounced just, or to be absolved and
made jus^ by imputation. In the former sense, wisdom is said to be justified
of her Children: Matthew. 11. 19. Luke 7. 37. Luke 7. 29.
Luke 7. 37. who, verse. 29. justified God. Christ, who is God, was manifested
in the flesh, justified in the Spirit, 1 Timothy 3. 16. Thus by our words we shall
be justi^ed, not made 1 Timothy 3. 16.
just formally or by inherent righteousness, but in the sense opposed to
condemnation. For as by thy words thou shall be justified, so by thy words
thou shall be condemned, Matthew. 12. 37. Thus not the hearers Matthew. 12. 37
alone, but the doers of the Law shall be justified, that is, pronounced just,
Romans 2. 13. and in this sense the faithful are justified by works, that is,
declared, approved, and known to be just. James 2. 21, 23. 24, Jam. 2. 21,
23. 24, 25.
25. cum Genes. 22. 12. ^n the latter sense, Ecclesiast. 1. 28. alias 22. the
famous man, Chap. 31. 5. The lover of Gold, Chap. 23. 14. alias 11. Eccles. 1.
28 31. 5. 23. 14.
The rash swearer shall not be justified, that is, as it is in the Commination
of the third Commandment, shall not be held guitlesse; but most plainly,
Chap. 26. the last verse, the huckster shall not be justified Eccles 26. ver^.
uit.
from sin, that is, not absolved from sin nor accepted as righteous. So
Act. 13. 38, 39. where most plainly, to be ^ustified from sin, Act. 13. 38,
39.
does signify to be absolved or freed from the guilt of sin, and is used
promiscuously with remission of sin. And this sense o^ freedom from the
guilt, is ^ometimes extended to signify a total freedom, as Romans Romans 6. 7.
6. 7. He that is dead is justified (that i^, as Chrysostom and O^umenius
expound it, (...) is freed) from sin. As these places are plainly repugnant
to the Popish sense: so none of the rest, where (...) is used, does favor it.
For either they import remission of sins, and acceptance as righteo^s, as
Luke 18. 14. The Publican who had Luk 18. 14.
humbled himself and craved pardon, went home justified, that is, obtained
pardon, and was accepted as righteous, rather than the Pharisee, who had
justified himself: or distinguish between justification and sanctification,
as 1 Cor. 6. 11. or exclude justification by inherent 1 Cor. 6. 11.
righteousness, as Romans 3. 20. Romans 4. 2. 1 Cor. 4. 4. Gal. 5. 4. Or imply
imputation, Rom 3 20. Romans 4 2. 1 Cor. 4. 4. G^l. ^. 4.
as where we are said to be justified either by his blood, as Romans 5. 9. Or by
faith, as Romans 5. 1. Gal. 3. 24. Or by grace, as Ti^. 3. 7 Or both exclude the
one and imply the other, as Romans 3. 24. 28. Gal. 2. 16, R^m. 5. 9. Gal 3. 24.
Tit. 3. 7. Romans 3 24, 28. Gal. 2. 16. 17. 3. 11.
17. 3. 11.

IV. There remain these two words, which I mentioned before, (...), and (...)
is used only in two plac^s, Romans 4. 25. and 5. 18. In the former it is said,
that Christ was delivered (to death) for (...)
our sins, and was raised again for our justific^tion, to whom, as it is
Romans 4. 25. 5. 18.
in the precedent verse, righteousness shall be imputed, if we believe on
him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead: for as our Savior by his
death, and obedience unt^ll death merited for us remission of sins, and the
right to eternal life; so by the acts of Christ restored to life, as namely by
his resurrection, his merits are effectually applied and imputed to our
justification. For if Christ had not risen again, we had been still in our
sins, 1 Cor. 15. 17. In the latter place, justification is in direct terms
opposed to condemnation. For as by the offense or transgression of one, viz.
the first Adam, (...) the guilt (which is to be supplied out of the sixteenth
verse) came upon all 1 Cor. 15. 17. Romans 5. 18.
men, the offspring of the first Adam, (...), unto condemnation: so by the
(...) of one, whereby he fulfilled the Law, viz. the second Adam, the (...),
or free gift opposite to the guilt of damnation, which is our title and right
to the kingdom of heaven, comes to all men (that belong to the second Adam)
unto justification of life.

V. The word (...) is divers^y used, both in the (...) in the purall number.
plural number, and in the singular. In the plural, it has three
significations; for first, it signifies Iura, the Laws or Commandments of
God, either in general and indefinitely, as namely where no other word of the
like signi^cation Psalm. 119. 8. 12. Romans 2. 26.
is joined with it, as Psalm. 119. 8, 12. Romans 2. 26. Or more particularly the
precepts of the ceremonial Law. And this sense is most usual, when it is
joined with words signifying other laws Luk 1. 6.
or precepts. For the whole Law, which is called mishmereth Genesis 26. 5. Za^h.
3. 7.
Jehovah, the observation of the Lord, that is, all that the Lord requires to
be observed, is often distinguished into three parts: ^eut. 5 3^. 6. 1. Deuteronomy
8. 11. 11. 1. 1 King. 2. 3. 8. 58. Nehem. 1. 7.
Mitsvoth, which the Septuagint translate (...), the Commandments of the
moral Law: Mishpatim, which they translate (...) or (...), the precepts of the
judicial Law: Chuqqim, which they translate sometimes (...), and sometimes
(...), the statutes and ordinances of the Ceremonial Law. Insomuch that the
vulgar Latin for Chuqqim, renders many times, even where the 72. have (...),
ceremonias, as Genesis 26. 5. Deuteronomy. 4. 8, Genesis 26. 5. Deuteronomy. 4. 8. Romans 9. 4, Heb.
9. 1. 10.
14, 45. 5. 1, 31. 6. 1. 17. 8. 11. 10. 13. 11. 1. etc. The Apostle Romans 9. 4.
calls the Moral Law (...), the Judicial (...), the Ceremonial (...), and
accordingly the precepts of the Ceremonial Law are called Heb. 9. 1. (...),
The ordinances of divine service, and because they were but external
observations, verse. 10. (...), carnal ordinances. Secondly, it signifies the
judgments of God, Apoc. 15. 4.
Apoc. 15. 4. which by the vulgar Latin and others is translated Iudicia. And
as (...) sometimes signifies the just works of God which are the acts of his
justice, so in the last place some expound (...), Apoc. 19. 8. to be the just
works of the Saints; and as the author of the Homilies in Saint Augustine,
justa facta, or just facta; as the Greek writers sometimes use the word;
which the Papists will needs translate justifications, meaning thereby just
works, and hoping thereby to prove that men are justified by them: which we
deny not in that sense wherein Saint James says we are justified, that is,
declared, and known to be just by them. But if justifications be the true
translation of (...), in that place, then we are thereby to understand the
merits of Christ, by which the Saints are justified; which are more fitly
resembled by a garment, than either inherent righteousness or righteous Apoc.
19. 8. Matthew. 22. 11, 12.
works. And is indeed called Matthew. 22. 11, 12. the wedding garment, which
garment is put on by a true faith, by which the faithful, as they are
exhorted, Romans 13. 14. put on Christ. Whereof Baptism is a seal, Gal. 5. 27.
And this is that white garment, which is to be had from Gal 5. 27. Apoc. 3.
18. Apoc. 3. 4. 6. 11. 7. 9.
Christ to cover our nakedness, Apoc. 3. 18. Sometimes indeed the white robes
do signify the glorious and happy estate promised to the faithful, as Apoc.
3. 4. 6. 11. 7. 9. which is purchased by the merits of Christ, for which cause
their robes are said to be made white in the blood of the Lamb. But here the
holy Ghost expounds the fine linen, wherewith the Saints are arrayed, to be
the justifications of the Saints; which, as I said, are the merits and
obedience of Christ put on by a true faith: which being without us, as garments
use to be, and yet being applied unto us and put on by faith, do cover our
nakedness, and therefore are more fitly resembled by fine linen pure and
shining, than our own righteousness; which neither is without us, as a
garment, nor yet pure, but Christ's righteousness imputed is both as a garment
pure and perfect in it self, and shines forth by the light of good works,
Mat. 5. 16. Matthew. 5. 16.


. VI. (...) is a verbal derived from (...), either as (...) signifies (...)
in the singular number. Ps^. 19. 10.
to be just, in which sense the precepts of God are said to be (...), Psalm.
19. 10. or as it signifies to be justified. In the former sense (...)
signifies that which is just, either as the Law of God prescribing
righteousness, (so the Law of nature written in the hearts Romans 1. 32.
of men is called (...). Romans 1. 32.) or as the whole righteousness Romans 5. 18.
which in the Law is prescribed, and so it is used, Romans 5. 18. For as by the
transgression of one, ( viz. the first Adam) whereby the whole Law was
violated, guilt came upon all men (that were in him) unto condemnation: so by
the (...) of one, the second Adam, whereby he fulfilled the whole Law, the free
gift, which is our right and title to heaven came upon all men (who are in him)
unto justification of life, and Romans 8. 4. God sent his Son (the Law being
impossible to be fulfilled Romans 8. 4.
by us) in the likeness of sinful flesh, that (...), all that the Law
requires to justification, might in our nature be performed Romans 5. 16.
and fulfilled. In the latter sense it is once only used, viz. Romans 5. 16. in
the same signification with (...), that is, justification, verse. 18. both of
them being opposed to condemnation. If therefore the words which the holy Ghost
does use to express the benefit of justification, do never signify
justification by inherent righteousness, but the contrary, as has been
^hewed: then that justification, which the Papists teach, is not that which is
taught in the holy Scriptures, but contrary to it.

. VII. And the same is proved by these two reasons: first, because The first
reason that the benefit of justification is expressed in such terms as do not
imply insusion of justice but imputation. Romans 4. 6, 7, 8.
the Apostles, when they express the benefit of justification in other terms,
they do signify the same, not by such words as import infusion of
righteousness; but by such, as plainly signify, either absolution from
sin, which is the not imputing of sin, or imputation of righteousness,
Romans 4. these phrases are used to signify one and the same thing: to justify,
to impute righteousness without works verse. 6. to remit sin, to cover sins,
verse. 7. not ^o impute sin, verse. 8. to be justified and to be blessed; and to
be blessed is to have their sins remitted or covered, verse. 6. Romans 5. 9, 10.
to be justified by the blood of Christ, and to be reconciled Romans 5. 9, 10. 2
Cor. 5. 19, 21.
unto God by his death all one, 2 Cor. 5. 19. to reconcile us unto himself,
not imputing our offenses unto us, and verse. 21. to make us the righteousness
of God in Christ, as he was made sin for us, Act. Act. 26. 18.
26. 18. that by faith we may have remission of sins, and inheritance, that
is, that we may be heirs of the heavenly inheritance among them that are
sanctified, Ioh. 3. 18. He that believes in Christ, (...) is not condemned,
that is, as Paul speaks Act. 13. 39. is justified: but he Ioh. 3. 18. Act.
13. 39.
that believes not him is condemned already. That, which Paul affirms Romans
3. 21, 22. now without the Law is manifested the righteousness Romans 3. 21, 22.
of God, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets, even the righteousness
of God, which is by the faith of Jesus Christ unto all and upon all that
belee^e; Saint Peter more plainly expresses, Act. 10. 43. unto him all the
Prophets bear witness, that every one, which Act. 10. 43.
believes in him, receives remission of sins through his name.

. VIII. Because the whole process of the justification of a sinner The whole
process of justification is judicial. Romans 8. 33, 34.
is judicial, Romans 8. 33 34., For the sinner summoning himself before the
judgment seat of God, as every one must do that would be justified; his own
conscience, being rightly informed by the paedagogie of the Law, accuses him,
the devil pleads against him, the Law convicteth him, and makes him (...),
Romans 3. 19.
subject to the sentence of condemnation, if God should judge him according to
his Law. But the sinner being instructed in the Gospel, and the holy Ghost
having opened Act. 16. 14.
his heart to believe, appealeth from the sentence of the Law to the promise of
the Gospel, and from the tribunal of justice to the throne of Grace, humbly
entreating the Lord for Christ's sake to pardon his sins, and to accept of the
merits and obedience of Christ, as a full satisfaction for them. Our Savior
sitting at the right hand of his Father makes intercession Romans 8. 34. 1 Ioh.
2. 2. Heb. 7. 25. 9. 24.
, and as an advocate pleads for him that forasmuch as he himself has paid
the debt, and satisfied Gods justice for the believing sinner; therefore the
Lord, not only in mercy, but also in justice is to remit his sin, and to
accept of him in Christ. The Lord, as a gracious and righteous judge imputing
to the believer the merits and righteousness of Christ, absolveth him from his
sins, and accepts of him as righteous in Christ, that is to say, justifies
him. The believing sinner being thus justified in the Court of heaven, is not
at the first justified in the Court of his own conscience, that is to say, is
not yet persuaded and assured of his justification; until the holy Ghost, by
the ministry of the Gospel pronouncing remission of sins and justification
to every one that believes, teaches him to apply the promises of the Gospel
unto himself, which he seals unto him by the Sacraments. The believer being
thus persuaded, and in some measure assured of his justification, gives
diligence by practicing the duties of repentance and sanctification, to
confirm and increase that assurance more and more unto the end of his life,
laboring by all good means to make sure his election, his vocation and his
justification: and so proceeds from faith to faith. The believer having thus
been justified in this life, both in the court of heaven, and in the court of
his own conscience; after this life, namely at the day of judgment, when our
Savior will judge of men's faiths according to the evidence of their works,
shall be justified, that is, pronounced happy and blessed. These Romans 2. 13.
three degrees of Gods most gracious proceeding with the faithful, I have set
down, not that there are so many degrees of justification, so properly called.
For the first degree only is that justification, whereof we treat, which
admits no degrees. The other are degrees of the declaration thereof; the
former, privately to the conscience of the faithful; the other, publicly to
the whole world.

CAP. III. The allegations of the Papists concerning the word justification:
the two first significations thereof assigned by Bellarmine.
. I.

HAving thus explained the true sense and meaning of Bellarmine relates four
significations of the word justification.
these words, which in the holy Scriptures are used to signify justification:
let us now examine the allegations of the Papists concerning the same.
Bellarmine therefore says De justif. l. 1. cap. 1.
that the word justification (meaning the Latin word) is used four ways in
the holy Scriptures, meaning the vulgar Latin edition, when as indeed neither
the Latin edition it self, nor the Latin word is in this question further to
be respected, than as it is a true translation of the Hebrew in the Old
Testament, and of the Greek in the New. First, says he, it is taken First,
that it signifies the Law. Psalm 119. 8. 12.
for the Law which teaches righteousness, and so is used, Psalm. 119. 8. I
will keep thy justifications: and verse. 12. teach me thy justifications, etc.
This Bellarmine barely expounds, without any further enforcing: but Gregory
Martin Discovery of translations, cap. 1. 50. and cap. 8.
, and our Rhemists In Luke 1. 6. and in Apoc. 19. 8.
urge it as a principal argument: that the precepts of the Law are therefore
called justifications, because the observation of them does justify us, and
therefore exclaim against us, that in our translations, we, in stead of
justifications, do read statutes or ordinances. As though in translating the
holy Scriptures we did profess to translate the Latin edition, and not the
Original Text. Now the word, which in the old Testament is by the vulgar Latin
interpreted justificationes, and by the 72. (...), is Chuqqim* which when it is
used alone, signifies undefinitely any of the precepts, statutes or
commandments of God: but being used with other words of the like
signification, from which it is distinguished, signifies the statutes and
ordinances of the Ceremonial Law: insomuch that the vulgar Latin in many
places, even where the Greek has (...), renders Ceremonias, a as I showed
before Cap. 2. sect. 5.
; which though the Latins sometimes call justificationes, yet by the
confession of the Papists themselves do not justify. And the like is to be
said of Luke 1. 6. where Zachary and Elizabeth Luke 1. 6.
are said to have walked in all the Commandments and justifications of the
Lord: where the Greek word is (...), which is the translation of Chuqqim, and
signifies the statutes of the ceremonial Law, as being distinguished from the
Commandments of the moral Law; but of the Greek word I have spoken
sufficiently before, Chap. 2.. 5. If therefore the force of the Latin word
justificationes be urged, I answer, that the observation of the moral Law can
justify no man that is a sinner, and much less the observation of the
ceremonial. And the conclusion, which they infer from the force of the word,
that the precepts of the Law are called justifications, because by the
observation of them men are justified, is directly contrary to that of the Rom
3. 28. Gal. 2. 16. 3* 11.
Apostle, that by the works of the Law no man living is, or can be justified.

II. But if they be justifications, whose are they? For so they Their Argument
retorted.
argue: If good works, say they, be the justifications of the Saints, then
they justify the Saints. So may I say, if the precepts of the Law be the
justifications of the Lord, then belike they justify him, but neither are
fitly called justifications; (though the Greek word (...), may not unfitly be
given both to the Law of God, as the rule of justice, and to the judgments of
God, as the acts of justice, and to the good deeds of the Saints as works of
justice; and also to the merits of Christ, Romans 5. 18. Apoc. 19. 8.
which notwithstanding do not justify him, but us) unless they mean, that
as by good works the faithful, so by righteous commandments and just
judgments God is declared and manifested to be just. And farther, the law of
Nature known to the Gentiles, is called Romans 1. 32.
(...), which notwithstanding does not justify either him or them, and is by
the Latin interpreter unfitly translated, the justice of God. And moreover
Bellarmine himself, as we have heard, notes that the Law is called
justification, because it teaches righteousness, and yet not that
righteousness by which we are justified; for that without the Law Romans 3. ^1.
is manifested in the Gospel, being witnessed by the Law and the Prophets;
even the righteousness of God which is by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
upon all that believe. But to conclude; Bellarmine had no reason to make this
the first signification of the word in the Scriptures, for the Hebrew word,
which the vulgar Latin translateth sometimes iustificationes, and sometimes
ceremonias in the same sense, does signify no such matter: and the Greek,
which twice Romans 5. 18.
at the most in the Scriptures signifies justification, does usually signify
the Apoc. 19. 8. forte.
Law of God, and his statutes and ordinances, but more especially those of the
ceremonial Law, which if they be any where called justifications, it is to be
imputed to the corrupt translation; and not to the original truth.

III. So much of the first signification. The two next, whereof The second and
third signification.
there is no example in the Scriptures, he has coined to fit their newfound
distinction of justification it self, which they distinguish into the first
and the second. The first, when a man of a sinner, is made just by infusion of
habitual righteousness. The second, when a just man is made more just by
practice of good works. Accordingly justification, says Bellarmine, in the
second place signifies acquisition of righteousness, viz. inherent, which is
their first justification; and in the third place incrementum justitiae, the
increase of justice, which is their second justification: which distinction, if
it were applied to sanctification, were not to be rejected. For that, which
they call their first justification, is the first act of our sanctification,
which the Scriptures call ^eration: in which the holy Ghost does ingenerate in
the soul of the Elect the grace of faith, and with it, and by it, other
sanctifying graces, wherein their justification, which is habitual,
consists. And that which they call their second justification being actual,
is our new obedience, by which our sanctification is continued and increased.
But to justification it cannot truly be applied; for first, justification is an
action of God, for it is God that does justify. Their second justification is
their own act, whereby they being just already make themselves more just.
Secondly, justification, as has been said, is an action of God without Lib. 1.
Cap. 1.
us, not implying a real mutation in us, but relative, such as is wrought by
the sentence of a Judge, and is opposed to condemnation. Thirdly, because it is
the righteousness of Christ by which we are justified, which is a perfect
righteousness, whereunto nothing can be added. Therefore of justification it
self there are no degrees, though of the assurance thereof there are degrees
according to the measure of our faith.

IV. But let us see how Bellarmine proves his second signification. The second
signification proved by three testimonies. The first, 1 Cor. 6. 11.
To that purpose he alleges three testimonies of Scripture, which prove
nothing else but that the Papists have no sound proof for their erroneous
conceit. The first is taken out of 1 Cor. 6. 11. And such were you, but ye are
washed, but ye are sanctified, but ye are justified. Where indeed the word is
used, but in a sense distinguished from sanctification. The scope and
intendment, the Apostle is to exhort the Corinthians, being now Christians, to
abstain from those sins whereunto they were addicted, whiles they lived in
Gentilisme. Such you were then, says the Apostle, but now since you gave your
names to Christ, you were baptized into his Name, and in your Baptism were
washed from those sins, being sanctified from the corruption of them by the
Spirit of God, and justified from the guilt of them in the Name of Jesus
Christ, that is, by faith in his Name. Thus therefore these three words are to
be distinguished. The washing of the soul, which is represented by the
washing of the body, is the general word whereby the purging of the soul from
sin is generally signified, Act. 22. 16. But as in sin there are two things
from which we had need to be purged, that is, the guilt of sin, and the
corruption thereof: so this ablution or washing of the soul has two parts,
ablution from the guilt of sin, which is our justification; ablution from the
corruption of sin, which is our sanctification. Both which are represented
and sealed in the Sacrament of Baptism, wherein, as the outward washing of the
body does represent the inward washing of the soul, both from the guilt and
corruption of sin: so the Element of water, whereby the body is washed or
sprinkled, is a sign of the water and blood which issued out of Christ's side,
whereby the soul is washed; that is to say, the blood of redemption, and the
water of sanctification: for by the blood, that is, the merits of Christ, we
are freed from the guilt of sin; and by the water, that is, the Spirit of
sanctification, we are freed in some measure from the corruption. And both
these, as I said, are signified in Baptism. For we are baptized into the
remission of sins, Act. 2. 38. Mar. 1. 4. Act 2. 38. Mark. 1. 4.
Our souls being washed with the blood of Christ, according to that in the
Nicene Creed, I believe one Baptism for the remission of sins: and we are
baptized unto the mortification of sin, and rising unto holiness of life,
Romans 6. 3, 4. our souls being washed by the water of the Romans 6. 3, 4.
holy Ghost. For we are baptized into the death of Christ and similitude of
his resurrection; that as Christ dyed and rose again, so we that are baptized
should dye unto sin, and rise to newness of life: for which cause Baptism
also is called the Laver of regeneration, Tit. Tit. 3. 5.
3. 5. This then is the sum and effect of the Apostles exhortation: that
seeing they having given their names unto Christ, had been baptized into his
Name, and were therefore Sacramentally at the least washed, and consequently
both in their own profession and opinion of others, judging according to
charity, sanctified from the corruption of sin, and justified from the guilt
of the same: therefore they should take heed, lest they should again be
polluted with those sins from which they were sanctified; or made guilty of
those crimes, from which they were justified.

V. His second testimony is Romans 8. 30. Whom he has called, them Bellarmines
second testimony.
he has justified. Answ. The Context does show, that the word in the 30.
verse is used in the same sense as verse 33. For having showed, Romans 8 30.
verse 33.
that whom the Lord calls, he does justify, and whom he does justify, them
also he does glorify: from thence he infers this consolation, who shall
lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that justifies, as was
said, verse 30. who shall condemn, etc. Where justifying most plainly is
used, as a judicial word, signifying by sentence to justify (as Chrysostom
and O^cumenius on this place do note) as opposed to accusing and condemning,
and cannot with any show of reason be drawn to signify contrary to the
perpetual use of the word, infusion of righteousness. But here it may be
objected, that in this place, where the Apostle sets down the degrees of
salvation, sanctification is either included in justification, or left our.
Answ. It is left out: for the Apostle setting down the chain of the causes of
salvation, in the degrees whereof every former being the cause of the latter,
left out sanctification, as being no cause of salvation, but the way unto it,
and the cognizance of them that are saved. And these degrees are so set down,
Act. 26. 18. where the end of the ministry is expressed: first, Vocation that
men should be called, and thereby brought to believe: secondly, Justification,
that by faith they may receive remission of sins: thirdly, Glorification,
that by faith they may receive the inheritance among them that are sanctified:
where sanctification is mentioned only as the cognizance of them that are
saved. Again, sanctification is left out, because it is included, in respect
of the beginning thereof, which is our conversion or regeneration, in vocation:
and in respect of the consummation, in glorification: for as sanctification is
gloria inchoata, so glorification is gratia consummata.

. VI. His third testimony is Romans 4. 5. to him that believes in him His third
Testimony, Romans 4. 5.
who justifies the ungodly. Ans. he should have done well to have made up the
sentence; his faith is imputed for righteousness: which place is so far srom
favoring the Popish conceit, that it plainly confutes it: first, it is called
the justification of the ungodly, that is, of one who is a sinner in himself:
for he that is a sinner in himself by inherent sin, and so remains, cannot
be justified by righteousness inherent: secondly, because to him that
believes in Christ, faith, relatively understood, that is, the righteousness
of Christ apprehended by faith, is imputed for righteousness: thirdly, because
in this place justification is expressed by these terms, not imputing sin,
remitting or covering of sin, imputing righteousness without works,
imputing faith for righteousness to him that works not, (that is, that
seeks not to be justified by his own righteousness) but believes in him
that justifies a sinner.

CAP. IIII. The third and fourth signification of the word justification
assigned by Bellarmine.
. I.

THirdly, says Bellarmine, justification is taken for increase His third
signification* for increase of justice.
of justice: for even as he is said to be heated, not only who of cold is made
hot, but also who of hot is made hotter: even so he is said to be justified,
who not only of a sinner is made just, but also of just is made more just*
Ans. In this comparison of like there is a great unlikenesse: for calefaction
implies a real mutation and a positive change in the subject from cold to
hot: but in justification the change is not real, but relative, as before has
been showed. Bellarmine therefore must prove, that to justify does signify
to make righteous formally by righteousness inherent, before he can prove that
it signifies the increase of inherent justice. But if the former cannot be
proved, much less the latter. But yet he brings three proofs, such as they
be.

. II. The first Ecclus. 18. 21. Ne verearis usque ad mortem justificari,
Bellarmines first proof out of Ecclus. 18. 21.
qu^niam merces Domini manet in aeternum: fear not to be justified until
death for the reward of the Lord adideth for ever. Answ. To omit, that the
book is Apocryphal, which ought not to be alleged in controversies of
faith: the testimony it self is vilely depraved. The words in the Original
are (...), that is, stay not until death to be justified; or as their own
interlinear translation reads Ariae Montani.
it, ne expectes usque ad mortem justificari, wait not until death to be
justified: where it is evident, that he speaks of justification in our first
conversion, which he would not have differred until the time of death, and not
of the continuance or increase of it: for then the sentence would bear a
contrary, and indeed an ungodly sense: (...), abide not or continue not to be
justified, or to be just until thy death. And the words, until death, are not
to be joined with the last word justified, but with the first, stay not until
death. And their translation of the words (...), whether as Bellarmine here
reads, ne verearis, or as some editions have ne veteris, has no affinity
with the Original. But our interpretation, as it agrees with the words of the
Text, so it is confirmed by the context. Use Physike before thou be sick,
before judgment prepare thy self, -- humble thy self before thou be sick,
and in the time of sins (that is, whiles thou mai'st yet sin) show thy
conversion; let nothing hinder thee to pay thy vows in due season, and defer
not until death to be justified, or to become just.

III. But this testimony Bellarmine urges again in another place, The same
place urged, de justif. l. 4. c.19.
showing that the place is to be understood of continuing and proceeding in
justice, and the words (...), are as much as cease not. And this he would prove
by that which goes before, be not hindered to pray always: where the wise man
admonishes us to increase our justice by continual prayer: and also by that
which immediately follows, because the reward of the Lord endures for ever:
for reward agrees not to the first justification of the wicked, but
indulgence. Answ. This interpretation of Bellarmine may then be admitted, when
it shall be proved: first, that (...) signifies to cease: secondly, (...) to
pray: thirdly, (...) always: fourthly, that those words, but the reward of the
Lord endures for ever, are found in the Original Text. But if Bellarmine
knew, that (...) signifies stay not, or wait not, and not cease not, (...),
to render the vow and not to pray; (...) in due season and without delay, and
not always; and that the clause concerning the reward of the Lord is not in
the Greek Text; then can it not be denied, but that Bellarmine endeavored
against his own conscience to father his error upon the Son of Sirach:
howbeit the reason which he renders is Pharisaicall: For unto the first
justification, says he, of sinners, not reward, but indulgence agrees, as
though there were any reward of our righteousness, (which always in this life
is impure and imperfect, Esai. 64. 6.) but by indulgence. If thou Lord
should mark what is amiss, O Lord, who shall stand? but with thee there is
mercy or indulgence, that thou may be feared, Psalm. 130. 3, 4. To them that
love God, and keep his Commandments, the Lord shows mercy, Exodus 20.6. To
thee Lord mercy, for thou reward'st a man, (meaning the godly man) according
to his works, Psalm. 62. 12. which plainly shows, that the reward of good
works is to be ascribed to Gods mercy and indulgence, and not to our defect:
for it is great mercy that he pardons the imperfection and iniquity of our
good works; greater, that he accepts of them in Christ; but greatest, that
he graciously rewards them: and who knows not that eternal life it self,
which is the reward that endures for ever, is the Romans 6.23.
free and undeserved gift of God, not rendered to our merits, but given of his
free grace.

IV. His second testimony is, Iam. 2.24. You see then that a man is His second
proof out of Iam. 2.24.
justified by works, and not by faith only. Answ. Of this place we are
hereafter to treat more fully. Now we are only to clear the signification of
the word, which in this place most evidently signifies, not to be justified
before God or made just, but to be approved or declared just. In which sense
the Schoolmen themselves do teach, that good works do justify declarative.
But here it may be objected, that Saint James in this place speaks of that
justification whereunto faith concurreth with good works, and good works with
faith. But to declare a man to be justified, faith being an inward and hidden
grace of the heart, has no use or efficacy; but it self is to be declared and
manifested by works, as it is verse 18. Answ. The Apostle does not speak Jam.
2.18.
of justifying faith it self, but of the profession thereof, or of says
professed only, as appears by the fourteenth verse, where the question is
propounded; What does it profit, my brethren, if a man shall say he has
faith, and have not works, can that faith, which is in profession only, save
him? Now to the justification of a man before men, and declaration of him to
be a man justified before God, two things are requisite; the profession of the
true faith, and a godly conversation answerable to that profession. For neither
good workss declare a man to be justified, if they be not joined with the
profession of the true faith: neither does the profession of faith justify a
man before men, if his faith cannot be demonstrated by good works. And in
this sense it is said, that a man is justified, that is, known to be just by
works, and not by faith only.

V. His third testimony is, Apoc. 22.11. Qui justus est justificetur adhuc, he
that is just let him be justified still. Answ. The word (...) in this place
does not signify to be justified, but to be just, as the word is often used
not only in the translation of the Septuagints, but also in the new Testament,
as I have showed before, as being the translation not of the passive, but of
tsadaq the verb neuter in Call, which signifies not to be justified, but to
be just. And this exposition is confirmed, first, by the words going before;
He that does wrong let him do wrong still, he that is filthy let him be
filthy still; and so, he that is just let him be just still. Secondly, by the
authority of the Complutensis editio, of the Kings Bible, of Andraeas
Caesariensis, and of Arethas in Apoc. who instead of (...) read (...), let him
work righteousness; of some Latin editions of the vulgar translation, which
instead of justificetur, read justitiam faciat; and lastly of Cyprian, who
renders the place thus, justus adhuc justiora faciat. This De bono patienti^.
place therefore does not speak of the increase of our justification before
God which cannot be increased, and much less are we exhorted unto it (for as
soon as a man is justified, he stands righteous before God in the most
perfect righteousness of CHRIST, which admits no increase) but of
perseverance in righteousness. Moreover, the word (...) still, does not
signify increase, but continuance.

VI. And these were Bellarmine his three first significations of The fourth
signi^ication of the word justification.
the word justification, whereof not any one can be proved out of the word of
God. Fourthly, says he, It is taken for the declaration of justice after a
judicial manner, in which sense he ^s said to be justified, who when he had
been by the accuser made guilty of some iniquity, is by the sentence of the
Judge declared just and absolved. And to this purpose he alleges not only
Prove. 17. 15. he that justifies the wicked and condemns the just, etc. And
Esaias 5. 23. But (which are not so pertinent) Luke 7. 35. and Luke 10. 29. Now,
says he, of the four acceptions of the word our adversaries teach this
fourth to be most proper. As for the ^econd, and the third which arises from
the second, they say it is improper, and not to be found in any approved
Authors. But of this matter, says he, we will discourse Libro 2. Cap. 3.
whether we will follow him. In the mean time let it be observed, that the
Papists who cannot approve their own acceptions of the word by any one place
of Scripture, do nevertheless acknowledge that use of the word which we do
maintain. But whereas he does insinuate, that we do therefore reject the
second and third significations, because the word is not so used in approved
Authors: I answer, if he speak of the Latin word (as he does) that it is
not used of the Authors of the Latin tongue at all; and in the Latin edition
of the Scriptures, and from thence in other Ecclesiastical writers, it is used
as the translation of the Hebrew and the Greek, and must accordingly be
understood. And if of the Greek, that it is not used indeed of the Authors of
the Greek tongue in the Popish sense. But that is not the reason why we
reject those senses, but because they are not to be found in the holy
Scriptures.

CAP. V. Bellarmines discourse concerning the signification of the word
justification, de Iustif. lib. 2. cap. 3. examined. De Iustif. l. 2. c. 3.

. I.

BUT let us examine Bellarmines disputation concerning the His 1. proof out of
Romans 5. 17, 18, 19.
signification of the word Lib. 2. Cap. 3. where alleging (...). 5. 17, 18,
19. to prove justification by inherent righteousness, he affirms, that to be
justified by Christ in that place, does signify to be made just by obtaining
righteousness (...). And this he would prove by two reasons: first, out of
those words j^sti constistuentur multi, many shall be constituted or made just:
From whence he argues thus:

To be constituted just is to be made just by inherent righteousness: To be
justified is to be constituted just, Romans 5. 19. Therefore to be constituted
just is to be made just by righteousness inherent.
Answ. We confess, that whosoever is justified is constituted, yea, is made
just: but the question is concerning the manner: whether by infusion of
righteousness, or by imputation. The assumption therefore is granted by us.
But the proposition is false, and has no ground in the Scriptures. Yea, the
contrary may be proved out of the place alleged; where justification, or
making righteous is opposed, not to the corruption of sin, but to guilt and
condemnation, verse. 16. and 18. And therefore he is said in this place to be
justified, or constituted righteous, who being absolved and acquitted from the
guilt of sin, and from condemnation, is accepted as righteous unto life: for
as in the former part of the 19. verse, many are said to be constituted
sinners, that is, as the Chrysoft. T^eodoret. (...).
Greek interpreters do expound it, and as appears by the former verses,
guilty of sin, and obnoxious to condemnation by the disobedience of Ada^,
meaning that one offense of his which we call his fall; which cannot be otherwise
understood but by imputation: so in the latter part, many are said to be
constituted just, by the obedience of the second Adam, that is, absolved from
the guilt of sin and condemnation, and accepted as righteous in Christ, his
obedience being communicated to them; which cannot be by any other means, but
by imputation. Neither can any reason be given why (...), to be constituted
just, should not be a judicial word, as well as (...) to be justified. In all
other places, this verb, whether it be used in the good sense or in the bad,
signifies no such thing, as Bellarmine infers upon it. For as in the bad it
signifies to convince or condemn, as Gal. Gal. 2. 18. Iam. 4. 4. Romans 5. 8. 2
Cor. 4. 2. 6. 4. 7. 11.
2. 18. Iam. 4. 4. so in the good, to approve or commend, as Romans 5. 8. 2 Cor.
4. 2. 6. 4. 7. 11. And accordingly the meaning of this place may be this: as by
the disobedience of the first Adam many were convicted and condemned as
sinners, that is, guilty of sin and damnation: so by the obedience of the
second Adam many shall be approved and accepted as righteous.

His reason is from the antithesis of Adam to Christ: which as I shall
hereafter ^ib 4. c. 10. sect. 1. etc.
in his due place prove, makes wholly against him: for if by the actual
disobedience of Adam imputed unto us we were made sinners; then by the
obedience of Christ imputed unto us we are made righteous: but the former is
true, therefore the latter. Of this antithesis I am hereafter to speak more at
large: in the mean time this may suffice to maintain and justify our
exposition of the word against Bellarmines cavils.

. II. But here Bellarmine frames to himself a fourefold Objection Bellarmines
answer, de justis. l. 2. c. 3. to four Ob^e- ctions out of C^lvin and
Chemnitius refuted. The first reason because justifying is opposed to
condemning. Bellarmines hi^t answer.
of Calvin and Chemnitius, proving that to justify is a judicial word,
signifying to absolve and to pronounce just. Their first reason is, because the
Apostle opposes justifying to condemning, as Romans 5. 16. 18. 8. 33. Therefore
as God is said to condemn, when he does not acquit a man, but pronouncing him
guilty deputeth him unto punishment: so on the contrary, he is said to
justify, when he acquitteth and absolveth a man from guilt, and pronouncing
him just accepts of him in Christ as righteous unto eternal life. To this
Bellarmine shapeth two answers: first, That justification is rightly opposed
to condemnation; but is not therefore always a judicial word: for even
condemnation it self sometimes is the act of a Judge appointing him to
punishment, who in judgment was found guilty: and sometimes it is the effect
of a fault, which has deserved punishment. And so Adam has condemned us, and
God condemns: but Adam has not condemned us by judging us after a judicial
manner, but by imprinting in us Original sin. After the same manner, says
he, justification sometimes is the act of a Judge, sometimes the effect of
grace. And both ways does Christ justify us: first, as the second Adam by
deletion of sin, and infusion of grace: secondly, in the day of judgment by
declaring them just, whom before he had made just.

Reply: Justification in this question, and in the places alleged, is
considered as an action of God, and being referred to God, it signifies, not
to make just by infusion of righteousness; but by sentence after the manner of
a Judge, to absolve from sin and to pronounce and accept as righteous, as
being opposed to condemning, which being referred to God, signifies not to
make sinful, but by sentence after the manner of a Judge to pronounce the
offendour guilty, and to award him punishment. But what either justifying or
condemning may signify, being referred to other either persons or things, it
is not material; so that it be confessed, (which cannot be denied) that
justifying, being ascribed to God, signifies not to make righteous by
infusion, no more than condemning, being attributed to God, signifies to make
wicked by infusion; but both are to be understood as the actions of a judge,
who either pronouncing a man just absolveth him from guilt; or pronouncing him
guilty appoints him to punishment. This therefore was an impertinent shift of
a subtle sophister having nothing to say to the purpose, for whereas he
applies his distinction of condemning and justifying to the first and second
Adam, as pertinent to the places alleged: I answer, first, that neither is
considered, as the act of the first or second Adam, but as Bellarmine
confesses in his second answer, as the actions of God the Judge: secondly,
that although in some sense the first Adam may be said to have condemned us,
as the second Adam is truly said, Esai. 53. 11. to justify us: yet both is to
be understood of the guilt of sin, brought upon us by the one, and taken
away by the other. For as the first Adam by his transgression may be said (...)
to have condemned us, because he has inwrapped us in the guilt of his sin,
and so made us guilty of death and obnoxious to the ^entence of condemnation,
that transgression of his being imputed us, being in him as the root: so the
second Adam may truly be said to justify us (who are in him) both as a surety
in taking upon him our guilt, and paying our debt for us, Esai. 53. 11. and
also as our intercessour and advocate pleading for us, that by imputation of
his righteousness we may be absolved from our sins, and accepted as
righteous in him.

. III. His second answer is, that although condemnation and justification
Bellarmines second answer.
some where signify the action of the Judge, as in the place cited, Romans 5.
16. yet notwithstanding when God does justify a sinner by d^claring him just,
he does also make him just, because the judgment of God is according to the
truth. And therefore Christ, whether he justifies us by his obedience, or by
his judgment, he always makes just. And thus Augustine (says he) understood
this place.

Reply: That God makes just, whom he pronounces just, we freely confess: but
the question still is of the manner, for in justification when he pronounces a
man just, he makes him just, and that perfectly just, not by infusion of
inherent righteousness, but by imputation of Christ's righteousness. And whom
he justifies, that is, makes just by imputation of righteousness; them he
also sanctifies, that is, makes just in some measure by infusion of grace.
For to use Bellarmines own words, when God does justify a sinner by declaring
him righteous, it is plain, that in himself he is a sinner, who by God is
declared to be just: and therefore, that he is not justified by inherent
justice, for in himself he is a sinner, as we all are. How then shall the
judgment of God be according to the truth, when he declares a sinner to be
just? To a sinner believing in Christ, the righteousness of Christ apprehended
by faith is imputed for righteousness, Romans 4. 5. and this we shall hereafter
Romans 4. 5.
show to be an argument unanswerable.

None, remaining sinners in themselves, can truly be declared or pronounced
just in respect of righteousness inherent.

All mortal men, even the most righteous of them, meraine sinners 1 Job. 1. 8.
Ecclus. 7. 20.
in themselves, 1 Ioh. 1. 8. Ecclus 7. 20. Therefore

No mortal man can truly be declared or pronounced just in respect of inherent
righteousness, and consequently none are or can be justified by
righteousness inherent.

IIII. The testimony of Augustine is falsified. For disputing Augustine de
peccatorum meritis and remis. Lib. 1. Cap. 15.
against the error of the Pelagians, who imagined that original sin was not
propagated from Adam, but that imitation only makes sinners by Adam: he
infers, that then by the same reason only imitation makes just by Christ.
As though either Adam had done no more against us, or Christ for us, than that
they had been prime examples and precedents, the one of sin, the other of
righteousness. But Augustine shows out of Romans 5. that as those who are
regenerated by the Spirit of Christ, obtain remission of sins and inward
grace: so those who come from Adam by natural generation, are made guilty of
his sin unto condemnation, and also receive corruption from him by
propagation, all which we teach. But that Augustine pleads not for
justification by inherent justice, appears by the antithesis, which in that
place he makes betwixt our condemnation by Adam, and our justification by
Christ. First, that whereas to condemnation there concurres Non tamen aliqua
justitia propter Christum, sicut aliqua peccata propter Adam.
our own voluntary transgression besides Adams sin: yet to our justification
there does not concur any righteoufnesse besides Christ. Secondly, (which
difference Saint Paul also notes Romans 5. 15, 16) because in the carnal
generation original sin only is contracted; but in the spiritual
regeneration there is remission not only of original, but also of voluntary
sins.

V. The second reason of Calvin and Chemnitius, which Bellarmine The second
reason of Calvin and Chemnitius, that as the Hebrew, so the Greek signifies.
takes upon him to confute, is this, because the Apostle writing of
justification did, no doubt, imitate the Hebrew phrase, though he wrote in
Greek. But the Hebrew word signifying to justify, has the judicial
signification. The argument may thus be propounded.

Such as is the signification of the Hebrew hitsdiq in the old Testament, the
same is the signification of the Greek word (...) both in the edition of the
Septuagints, as being the translation thereof, and in the new Testament, which
in this point retains the translation of the Septuagints:

But the Hebrew hitsdiq is merely a judicial word, opposed to condemnation,
as I have proved heretofore by induction of examples, as Deuteronomy. 25. 1. 1 King.
32. 8. Prove. 17. 15. Esai 5. 23. and never signifies to make righteous by
infusion, or to endue with righteousness inherent:

Therefore the Greek word also has the same signification.

To the assumption Bellarmine answers, that the Hebrew word properly
signifies to make just, but because a man may be made just, both inwardly by
obtaining of justice, and outwardly by declaration; hence it is, that the word
admits these diverse significations. Reply. In this answer we are to take his
confession of the truth, both that we may be made just outwardly by
declaration, and also that the Verb sometimes does signify so much. In vain
therefore do the Papists urge against us the signification of the Latin word
justificare, as signifying justum facere. seeing by our exposition it
signifies justum facere also, not only by declaration, as Bellarmine here
speaks, but much more by imputation. But though he confesses the
signification of the Verb urged by us: yet we may not acknowledge the
signification so much urged by the Papists: yea we confidently deny, that the
Hebrew hitsdiq does any where in the Scriptures signify to endue with
righteousness inherent.

VI. This therefore he endeavors to prove by induction of Bellarmines first
testimony, Dan. 12. 3.
examples, and first out of Dan. 12. 3. Qui adjustitiam erudiunt multos, who
instruct many to righteousness. The Hebrew word is matsdiqim, where the
Prophet speaking of the great glory which shall be of Teachers, who justify
many, the vulgar Latin (which is the only authentic Text among the Papists)
does not translate the word making righteous by infusion, or enduing with
righteousness inherent, which is the work of God alone, and not of the
Teacher; but instructing unto righteousness, or as Bellarmine himself
expounds, by teaching to bring men to righteousness; which is done by
bringing them to believe, and therefore this allegation proves not the Popish
signification of the word. Yea, but it disproveth, says Bellarmine, the
judicial signification so much urged by you. For Teachers do not justify
after the manner of ^udges, (howbeit the Popish Priests dot in their absolutions
as themselves do teach.)

Reply. But this is nothing but a cavil. For where we say, that to justify,
in this doctrine of justification, is verbum forense, a word taken from Courts,
having a judicial signification, as namely to absolve from sin, or to give
sentence with a man after the manner of a Judge: our meaning is, that this word
being attributed to God, as it is God alone that justifies, (and so we
consider justification as an action of God) it always has this judicial
signification, and never signifies to endue with righteousness inherent. But
we do not say, that it being attributed to any other, as it is to diverse
others both persons and things, it is to be expounded as the act of the Judge;
though otherwise the justice employed in the signification of the word, be
after the judicial sense, not inherent, but imputative. Thus (as I have said
before) Christ justifies, not only as he is our Judge, but also as our
Surety paying our debt, and as our Advocate pleading for us. The holy Ghost
justifies, both as he is the Spirit of regeneration working in us the grace of
faith; and as the Spirit of adoption, by applying unto us the merits of Christ,
assuring us of our justification and adoption. The Ministers of the Gospel
justify (as they are also said to forgive sins, to beget men unto God, and
to save them) ministerially, as the Ambassadors of Christ, whose office it is
to reconcile men unto God, to preach and to pronounce remission of sins to
them that believe, and also instrumentally, as the instruments of the holy
Ghost, to work in them the grace of faith, by which they are justified: for
faith comes by hearing Romans 10. 14, 17. and Preachers are said to be
Ministers by whom you believe, 1 Cor. 3. 5. Sacraments do justify as seals
of that righteousness which is by faith, Romans 4. 11. And as the Ministry of
the Word and Sacraments do justify ut manus dantis, as the hand of God giving
and applying Christ and his righteousness to the faithful receiver: so faith
is manus accipie^tis, the hand of the believer receiving Christ and his
righteousness unto justification.

VII. But the second place is in his conceit more clear, viz. His second
Testimony, Esai. 53. 11.
Esai. 53. 11. where the Lord speaking by his Prophet concerning Christ, says,
My righteous servant shall by his knowledge justify many, and he shall bear
their sins, where the verb is in Hiphil Iatsdiq, which signifies shall make
just: Chemnitius indeed, says he, goes about to wrest this place also to the
judicial signification: But in vain, for there are four words which are
manifestly repugnant to his interpretation. But before we speak of those
four words, let us hear what Exam. part. 1. page 131. a.
Chemnitius says, Whereas Andradius (says he) wresteth that sentence of Esaias
to prove, that to justify is to endue the mind with the quality of inherent
justice, it is great impudency for there is presently added an exposition, how
that justification is to be understood, because he shall, says Esaias, bear
their iniquities: where Chemnitius does not so much as mention the judicial
signification of the word, justifying, after the manner of a Judge, but rather
signifies, that Christ at his first coming, did not justify the Elect after
the manner of a Judge, but as a surety in taking upon himself our debt and
bearing our iniquities, and as a Redeemer paying our ransom, and so di
charging us from our debt and from our bondage. Neither does it follow, that it
is not a judicial word, because in that place it signifies not to justify as
a Judge, for besides the Judge there are other parties also who do justify in
a judicial sense, as namely sureties and advocates.

. VIII. Now let us examine those four words, all which serve to The four
words which (...) takes hold of.
prove that Christ in that place is not said to justify after the manner of a
Judge, which no man affirms, and therefore Bellarmine fights with his own
shadow. For we doubt not, but that Christ may be said to justify diverse ways:
first, by his doctrine, as our Prophet and Teacher* in which sense Teachers are
said to justify, Dan. 12. 3. secondly, as our Priest, both by his satisfaction
and sacrifice propitiatory, as Esai. 53. 11. for so he says, and he shall
bear their iniquities; so Heb. 9. 26, 28. and also by his intercession, as our
Advocate, 1 Ioh. 2. 2. Romans 8. 34. Heb. 9. 24. thirdly, by his sentence, as our
king and judge at the 2 Timothy 4. 1. The first word, by his knowledge.
last day, Matthew. 25. 34. The first word is by his knowledge, that is, as he
expounds it out of Hierome, by his doctrine. Answ. We deny not, but that
Christ by his doctrine did justify many, working in them the grace of faith,
for even other Teachers, who are but his Ministers, do also justify others,
as Daniel speaks, not by infusion of righteousness, but as the instruments
of the holy Ghost to beget faith in the hearers, or being, as Saint Paul
speaks, Ministers by whom they do believe, and believing are justified in
the judicial sense. But Esaias speaks not of his doctrine, but of his
knowledge, and that passively understood; not, for that knowledge whereby he
knows all things, but whereby he is acknowledged to be the Messiah, that is
to say, faith; and so Pagnine, Vatablus, and Tremellius read, scientia sui, or
agnitione sui, that is, by faith in him (for so is faith often termed, as 2
Pet. 1. 2, 3. and 1 Timothy 2. 4. etc. by which, as it is said in this place of
Esaias, he does justify La rabbim, that is as Paul speaks Romans 5. 19. (...),
the multitude of the Elect, who believe in him: how? by bearing their
iniquiti^s, that is, the punishment due for their sins, his sufferings being
imputed to them: if therefore justifying by faith do prove justification by
works or by inherent righteousness, then this word proves it.

. IX. The second word is ipse justus: by which word, says he, is signified The
second word, ipse justus.
that Christ does justify not only by teaching, but also by just working, and
by imparting his righteousness unto us. Answ. Christ his obedience or just
working is proper to his person, and inherent in him, and therefore that
righteousness, which he performed in his own person, being both active, and
therefore transient, and proper to his person, and therefore without us, cannot
be imparted to us otherwise than by imputation. To what purpose then does he
urge this word, seeing Christ is just in justifying us, as well by imputation,
as by infusion? Forsooth, to show, that Christ by his obedience and sufferings
does not justify after the manner of a Judge: which no man affirms. But what
is his reason? because it is not required to justifying after a judicial
manner, that he, who justifies others, should himself be just: as if he
should say, it is not required that a Judge should be just: contrary to that
Genesis 18. 25. But God does justify us after the judicial manner, as a Judge,
through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, and by forgiveness of sins,
and that to this end to show forth his justice that he might be just* and the
justifier of him who believes in Jesus, Romans 3. 25, 26. But this might better
have been objected against his own exposition of the former word; seeing he,
who is not just himself, may by his doctrine justify others. Notwithstanding,
that which Bellarmine here affirms concerning Christ, is most true: that it
was necessary, that he who should justify others by his obedience should be
just himself: howbeit he impertinently alleges, Romans 3. 26. which speaks
of God justifying us, not as a Mediator by his obedience, but as a Judge by his
sentence. But the true reason, why the Prophet uses this word, is in respect
of the words following, to signify that Jesus Christ the righteous was made a
propitiation for our sins, 1 Ioh. 2. 2. and that Christ, who was just and
knew no sin, was made sin for us, that we might be the righteousness of
God in him, as the Apostle speaks, 2 Cor. 5. 21. and Esai. 53. 5, 6, 6.

. X. The third word is my servant: which signifies that Christ did The third
word, my servant.
serve his Father in the work of justification, and consequently did justify
men, not by judging, but by ministering, as himself says, Matthew. 20. 28. and
is therefore called the Minister of Circumcision; that is, of the Jews. The
The fourth, and he shall* bear their iniquities.
fourth word and he shall bear their iniquities: which signifies the manner
how Christ by ministering does justify; that is, by bearing the burden of our
sins upon his shoulders; that is, by suffering the punishment due for our
sins. Answ. The thing which he indevoureth to prove, viz. that Christ, as he
performed the office of Mediation in the days of his flesh, did not justify
us after the manner of a Judge, is true. But his reasons are not sufficient.
Not the former, for he might be Gods Minister or servant, as all Kings or
Judges are, and yet our Judge. Not the second; for although he were our Priest
to offer himself for us, and by his obedience and sufferings to justify us;
yet is he also our King and our Judge, who by his sentence will justify us at
the last day. But although Christ did not justify us after the manner of a
Judge: yet it follows not either that the word does signify infusion of
justice, to which purpose Andradius alleged this place, or that it is not a
judicial word. For it is a judicial word as it is attributed not only to
Judges, but also to sureties and advocates. Christ, as our Advocate, justifies
by pleading for us as asurety, by bearing the punishment judicially imposed
upon us. And whereas Bellarmine would prove out of 1 Pet. 2. 24. that inherent
righteousness is an effect of Christ's satisfaction, or bearing our iniquities,
he proves nothing but what we teach, viz. that the fruits and end of our
justification and redemption by Christ is our sanctification, Luke 1. 74, 75.
Romans 6. 22. Tit. 2. 14. And consequently that our sanctification or inherent
righteousness, being the fruit and effect of our justification, cannot be the
cause thereof, no more than it is the cause of redemption. For

By what righteousness we are redeemed, by the same we are justified: for
redemption and justification in substance differ not, Romans 4. 6. 7. 3. 24. 25.
Col. 1. 14. Ephesians. 1. 7. By the righteousness of Christ we are redeemed, which
is out of us in him, and not by righteousness inherent. Therefore By that
righteousness of Christ, which is out of us in him, we are justified, and not
by righteousness inherent.
His third place is Apoc. 22. 11. which I have fully answered before: Lib. 2.
cap. 4. sect. 5. Ap. 22. 11.
and is here impertinently recited to prove the signification of the Hebrew
word, being not sufficient to clear the Greek. Seeing their own best
editions in stead of (...), read (...), as I have showed before.

. II. The third and fourth reason, which Bellarmine alleges out of Calvin and
Chemnitius, and answers them together, are concerning the signification and
composition of the Latin word justificare: which indeed are not used as
arguments to prove the true signification of the word in this controversy, but
as just exceptions against the arguments of the Papists, who rely too much upon
the signification and composition of the Latin word: wherein they were justly
reprooved by Chemnitius; first, because the controversy being, what is the use
and signification of the word in the Scriptures, it is not material, what the
Latin word does signify in other authors; but what is the signification of
the Hebrew word in the Old Testament, and of the Greek in the New, whereof the
Latin is merely a Translation. And therefore the Latin, if it be a right
Translation, must in this controversy be understood to signify the self
same thing with the Hebrew and the Greek: the use and signification whereof in
the Scriptures is judicial, and is never used in the Popish sense: wherefore
though the use of the word in other authors did favor the Popish conceit, yet
would it not disadvantage us: secondly, though the Latin words do signific to
make just, (which is all that can be enforced from the signification and
composition thereof) and be so expounded by Augustine, whom Bellarmine to that
purpose alleges, yet this makes nothing against us. Not only because
Bellarmine has confessed, men may be made just, either inwardly by obtaining
of righteousness inherent, or outwardly after a judicial manner; but also
because we freely profess that whom God does justify, he makes righteous by
imputation of Christ's righteousness. It is true indeed, that some of our
Divines deny the word to signify making righteous: but their denial is to be
understood according to the meaning of the Papists, viz. by infusion: thirdly,
the Latin word justificare, and so the English, as in the translation of the
Scriptures it has always the judicial signification, and never signifies to
endue with righteousness inherent, no more than the Hebrew and the Greek
whereof it is a translation: so oftentimes in the Fathers, and many times in
the Popish writers, and always almost in the common use of speech, it
signifies to clear from guilt, to free from imputation of fault, to approve,
to declare, or pronounce just. Or if at any time it be used in the sense of
induing with righteousness inherent, it is contrary to the use of the
Scriptures, which in the doctrine of justification is to be retained.

. XII. Yea, but the Fathers interpret justifying to be making righteous, The
use of the word in the Fathers.
whom to refuse in an ecclesiastical question, and to appeal to the judgment
of the Latin authors as Tully and Terence, is a great importunity, says
Bellarmine, especially seeing the Apostle has taught, that to be justified, is
to be constituted or made just, according to the composition of the word. Answ.
That which is said of the Authors of the Latin tongue is a mere calumniation,
for in them the word is not used at all. The interpretation of the Fathers,
according to the doctrine of Saint Paul we approve; acknowledging, that whom
God does justify, he makes them just, by imputation of Christ's
righteousness. Yea but, say they, the Fathers mean by inherent justice. Answ.
Though some of the Latin Fathers, who were ignorant of the Hebrew, and not
skillful in the Greek, sometimes under the term of justification include the
benefit also of sanctification, being led thereunto by the notation of the
Latin word; yet sometimes they exclude it; as first, when they place
justification in remission of sins, as many times they do: secondly, when
according to the Scriptures they oppose it to condemnation: thirdly, and
especially, when with one consent they plainly teach, that we are justified by
faith alone, as hereafter shall be showed: which cannot be understood of
justification by inherent righteousness. For it were very absurd to affirm
(which the Papists would feign father upon us) that to justification by
inherent righteousness nothing is required but faith only. Again, Bellarmine
objecteth, which in the ninth Chapter (where he confesses justification to be
often taken in the Scriptures for declaration of righteousness) he more
plainly expresses, although to justify were every where taken for to
pronounce just, yet that were no advantage to us. For a sinner cannot truly be
pronounced just, unless he who pronounces him just, do withal make him
just, which God only can do. And therefore he alone is said to justify a
sinner, and by absolving him to make him truly just. Answer. Whom God
pronounces just, them he makes just: but still the question is of the
manner: for to justify by absolving, is to make righteous by the not imputing
of sin, and imputing of righteousness, and not by infusion of
righteousness: for that is not to justify, but to sanctify. Howbeit we
freely confess, that whom God justifies, he also sanctifies, and that
whosoever is in CHRIST JESUS, he is a new Creature. But howsoever these graces
do always concur, insomuch that whosoever has the one has the other, and
whosoever has not both, has neither: yet notwithstanding they must carefully
be distinguished. And that is it which hitherto I have endeavored to prove.

CAP. VI. H^w Justification and Sanctification are to be distinguished.
. I.

NOw let us consider how they are distinguished. First, by their contraries.
And first the difference of them may appear by their contraries. The contrary
to justifying is condemning: the contrary to sanctifying is polluting or
defiling with sin: first therefore the word, which signifies to condemn, if
you respect the force of the word, signifies to make Hirshiah.
wicked, even as the Verb which signifies to justify does; if you respect
the force Hitsdiq.
of the word, it signifies to make just: As God therefore, when he
condemns, is said to make wicked, not by infusion of wickedness, but by his
sentence, pronouncing the party guilty, and deputing him to punishment: so when
he justifies, he makes just by his sentence, not by infusion of
righteousness, quatenus justificat: but by imputation of Christ's
righteousness he absolveth the party from guilt and punishment, and accepts
of him as righteous in Christ, and as an heir of eternal life: secondly, the
contrary to sanctifying, which is to make holy, is polluting or defiling with
sin, which is to make unholy and unclean. What difference therefore is
between condemning and polluting, the like is between justifying and
sanctifying. And as condemning and polluting are by no means to be
confounded, no more can justifying and sanctifying.

. II. In justification we are freed from the guilt of sin: in
sanctification, from the corruption or pollution of sin. For God is then

said to justify us, when he absolveth us from the guilt of sin by
imputation of Christ's righteousness: and he is then said to sanctify us,
when by his Spirit he mortifieth sin in us, and freeth us in some measure
from the corruption thereof.

. II. Justification is an action of God without us, as also are redemption,
reconciliation, and adoption, which three benefits in substance Thirdly, an
action of God without us. within us.

differ not from justification, but are all comprehended under it: the second
first being the same in effect with the former part of justification, viz.
remission of sins; and the last being all one with the second part of
justification, which is acceptance of the believer as righteousness in
Christ, and as an heir of eternal life, as I have showed heretofore: for then
are we said to have redemption, Ephesians. 1. 7.
when we have remission of sins, then is God said to reconcile 2 Cor. 5. 19.
us unto himself, Col. 1. 14.
when he does not impute our sins unto us: then he is said to adopt us,
when he accepts Ephesians. 1. 5, 6. Romans 8. 17.
of us in Christ as righteous and as heirs of eternal life. None of these
actions does work a Real change in the party, but imports a new relation
between God and them, as has been showed. But sanctification is an action of
Gods Spirit within us, working in us a real change, by mortification of sin
within us, and infusion of Grace and righteousness into us.

. IV. Of justification the matter is the righteousness of Christ, Fourthly, in
respect of the matter.
which is in him as the subject, but imputed to us: the matter of
sanctification is a righteousness derived from Christ, but inherent in us. The
matter therefore of our justification is perfect, but not inherent, to wit, the
most perfect righteousness of Christ, which is out of us in him. The matter of
our sanctification is inherent, but not perfect, to wit, justitia inchoata, a
righteousness which is but begun in us, and that new obedience, which though
it be sincere and unfeigned, is with great infirmity performed by us; recta
forsan, sed non pura justitia, as Bernard says.

. V. Hereupon it follows, that of justification it self, whereby we are
justified before God, there are no degrees; (though of the assurance Fifthly,
degrees of sanctification, but none of justification.
thereof there be, which are the degrees of special faith) because to the
most perfect righteousness of Christ, by which we are even in our first
conversion justified, nothing can be added; and therefore, as I have said, the
faith of all the faithful though different in degrees, is (...), 2 Pet. 1. 1.
of equal worth in the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ:
even as the hands of diverse men though unequal in strength, yet are of equal
efficacy in respect of the alms received thereby. But of sanctification there
are degrees according to the measure of grace received.

. VI. The form of justification considered as an action of God, is imputation
of Christ's righteousness: of sanctification, the infusion Sixthly, in respect
of the form.
of righteousness. For God by imputation of Christ's righteousness does
justify us: and he does sanctify by infusion of righteousness.

. VII. The parts of justification, are remission or not imputing Seventhly, in
regard of the pa^ts.
of sin unto condemnation, and acceptance as righteous unto life, both
wrought by imputation of Christ's righteousness unto us. The parts of
sanctification are mortification, whereby we dye unto sin, and vivification
whereby we live unto righteousness, rising from the grave of sin, unto
newness of life; and is therefore called the first resurrection; both wrought
in us by the Spirit of sanctification.

. VIII. We are justified by faith, not as it is a grace or habit in Eighthly,
in respect of faith.
us, that is to say, as it is a part of inherent righteousness: but as the
hand or instrument receiving the righteousness of Christ, which is imputed to
them that believe: but we are sanctified by faith, as it is a part of that
righteousness, which is inherent in us. And therefore we are justified by
faith alone, because no other grace does concur with it to the act of
justification, none of them serving to receive the righteousness of Christ,
but faith only: but we are not sanctified by faith alone, because with it
concur not only all other inward graces, but also our outward obedience.

. IX. The righteousness, by which we are justified, is not prescribed in the
Law, but without Romans 3. 31.
the Law is revealed in the Gospel, Ninthly, in respect of the Law.
the righteousness of God, that is to say, of Christ, who is God, apprehended
by faith. For the Law to justification requires perfect and perpetual
obedience to be performed by him in his own person, that should be justified
thereby; which fince the fall of Adam has been, and is by reason of the flesh
impossible to all men, who are descended from Adam by ordinary generation. But
the Gospel assures justification without respect of works to all that truly
believe in Christ, teaching that we are justified by faith, that is, by the
righteousness of Christ apprehended by faith, without the works of the Law,
that is, without respect of any obedience prescribed in the Law and performed
by us. But the righteousness, by which we are sanctified, is prescribed in
the Law, which is a most perfect rule of all righteousness inherent.

. X. Unto the act of justification our own righteousness and obedience do
not concur as any cause thereof, but follow in the subject, Tenthly works in
the question of justification, of no value, sanctification, of great worth.
that is, the party justified, as necessary fruits of our redemption and
justification. Yea, in the question of justification, wherein is considered,
what that is by which we are justified and saved in hope; our own
righteousness and obedience, if it should be obtruded as the matter of our
justification, is to be esteemed as Phil. 3. 8.
dung, that we may be found in Christ, not having our own righteousness,
which is prescribed in the Law; but that, which is through the faith of Christ.
But in the question of sanctification, that righteousness, which is inherent
in us, and that obedience which is performed by us, is all in all, as being
both that habitual and also actual righteousness and holiness wherein our
sanctification does consist. Eleventhly, by justification entitled, by
sanctification fitted for Gods kingdom.


. XI. By our justification we are Act. 26. 18. Tit. 3. 7.
entitled to Gods kingdom, that is, saved in hope: by our sanctification we
are fitted and prepared for Gods kingdom, into which no unclean Apoc. 21. 27.
thing can enter. Justification therefore is the right of Gods children to
their inheritance. Sanctification is the cognizance and mark of those that
shall be saved, wherefore our Savior says, that Act. 26. 18.
by faith we have remission of sins, and inheritance among them that are
sanctified. In the Greek Text there is a comma after (...). and therefore the
words (...), are not to be conserved with the Participle (...), but with the
Verb (...), thus, that by faith they may receive remission of sins, and
inheritance among them that are sanctified.


. XII. The righteousness by which we are justified, is the meritorious cause
of our salvation. But the righteousness by which we are sanctified, is a fruit
of our justification, but no cause of our salvation; unless you will call it
causam sine qua non, which is no cause, for we are neither saved by it, nor for
it, but only by and for the merits of Christ apprehended by faith. But though
it be not the cause by or for which we are justified or saved: yet it is the
way wherein we being once justified, are to walk toward our country in
heaven, Ephesians. 2. 10. as Bernard well says, via regni, non causa regnandi, the
way which leads to the kingdom, but not the cause of coming unto it.

cause the holy Ghost in the Scriptures does never exhort us to justification
or the parts thereof, viz. remission of sin and acceptance of the believer
as righteous unto life, as being the actions of God: but to sanctification and
the parts thereof he uses to exhort, as to mortification, Col. 3. 5.

does justify alone. The other mediate, which it brings Seventeenthly, of

is of sinners, and consists partly in remission of sins.

. XIX. Of this difference between justification and sanctification The Papist^
wilf^ll confounding of justification and sanctification, the ground of their
malicious calumniations against us.
the Papists will by no means take notice, though it be manifold and
manifest. But will needs understand justification to be that, which we,
according to the Scriptures, call sanctification. And this is the very ground,
both of their malicious calumniations against us; and also of their own
damnable errors concerning justification. For as if we also did confound
justification and sanctification, they charge us, as if we taught that we are
sanctified by faith alone, that we are formally made just or sanctified by a
righteousness, which is without us, etc.

But if we did hold, that justification were to be confounded with
sanctification, we would acknowledge, that the most things, which the Papists
affirm concerning justification, are true, because they are true of
sanctification. As namely that we are not sanctified by faith alone, that we
are sanctified by a righteousness inherent in us and performed by us; that it
is partly habitual, consisting in the habits of grace, as faith, hope,
charity, etc. and partly actual, which is our new obedience consisting in good
works; which are the fruits and effects of our faith, and charity, and other
inward graces. That of sanctification there are degrees, and that by exercise
and practice of the duties of holiness and righteousness, our sanctification
is increased, etc.

. XX. What then? Is the difference between us and the Papists It is also the
source of their errors, which are most pernicious.
in this great controvefie only in words? Nothing less. For as their
confounding of justification and sanctification is the ground of their
calumniations against us, so of their own errors. For confounding
justification and sanctification, first they confound the Law and the First,
they confound the Law and the Gospel, and are farther from grace.
Gospel, the covenant of works and the covenant of grace; as if the Gospel
did unto justification require inherent, and that a more perfect
righteousness, than the Law requires. And consequently, with the false
Apostles and teachers of the Galatians, do teach another Gal. 1. 8, 9.
Gospel than that which the Apostle taught; which, whosoever does, he is
accursed. Whrefore the samethings, which the Apostle objecteth against the
Galatians, who were seduced by their false Teachers, are verified of the
Papists: who seekng to be justified by the works of the G l 310.
Law are under the curse: they are fallen Gal. 5. 2, 4.
from grace, to them the promise is of no effect, to them Christ dyed in vain,
then Christ profits nothing, as hereafter I shall show. For whosoever seeks
to be justified by the works of the Law, he is a Gal. 5. 3.
debtour to the whole Law, and to him, who is a debtour to the whole Law, (that
is, to be subject to the curse, if he transgress it, and to be excluded from
justification and salvation, if he do not perfectly fulfill it) Christ
profits nothing. For whereas they distinguish the works, which they make the
condition of both the Covenants, that the one are the works of Nature, the
other of grace; it is evident, that all good works and all inherent
righteousness is prescribed in the Law, which is the most perfect rule of all
inherent righteousness. Secondly, that inherent righteousness is not the
condition of the covenant of grace, but is the thing promised to all that
truly believe. For the better understanding whereof, we are to know, that the
covenant of works was made with all mankind in Adam; the Covenant of Grace
with the heirs of promise in Christ. The former promises justification to
these, who in their own persons perform perfect obedience; that perfect
obedience being the condition of the Covenant. The latter, that to us the
sons of Abraham being redeemed and justified by faith, the Lord will give
grace Luke 1. 73, 74, 75.
to worship him in holiness and righteousness before him, in which our Heb.
8. 10. ex Ier. 3. 31. 33. Heb. 10. 16.
new obedience consists; which, (as I said) is not the condition of the
promise, but the thing promised.

. XXI. Secondly, by confounding justification and sanctification They place the
matter of justification and merit of salvation in themselves.
they teach men to place the matter of justification and merit of salvation in
themselves. For the matter of sanctification is inherent: and that, which is
the matter of justification, is the merit of salvation. Again, that which is
inherent, is both prescribed in the Law, and is also our own, though received
from God: which the Pharisie. Luke 18. 11^
himself confessed, when he thanked God for it. But the holy Ghost does teach
us, that we are neither justified by the obedience or righteousness which is
taught Romans 3. 21. 28. Gal. 2. 16.
in the Law, nor by that Phil. 3. 8. 9. Romans 10. 3. ^
which is ours. And in regard of this very difference betwixt the Papists and
us, we are not unworthily called Evangelici the professors of the Gospel; and
they, the enemies thereof: who seeking to establish their own righteousness,
do with scorn reject the righteousness of Christ imputed: which is that
righteousness of God Romans 1. 16. 17.
revealed in the Gospel from faith to faith. This being the maine doctrine of
the Gospel, that we are justified, not by any righteousness inherent in our
selves, or performed by our selves, but by the righteousness of Christ alone
apprehended by faith.

. XXII. By confounding justification and sanctification, and so Thirdly, they
wholly take away the benefit of justification.
of two benefits making but one, they do abolish and take away that maine
benefit of the Messiah, by which we are not only freed from hell, but also
entitled unto the kingdom of heaven which the Scriptures distinctly call our
justification, without which there can be no salvation. For whom God does
justify, all them, Romans 8. 30.
and only them he does glorify. And that they do wholly take away the
benefit of justification, it shall further appear in handling the second
question of this first controversy, whereof I am now to speak.

CAP. VII. That the Papists exclude remission of sin from Justification, and
in stead thereof have put expulsion and extinction of sin by infusion of
righteousness; and that they foully err therein.
. I.

BUT hear it will be objected, that so long as Objections that the Papists
retaining remission of sins, do not wholly take away the benefit of
justification.
the Papists acknowledge remission of sin to concur unto justification,
they cannot be said wholly to take away the benefit of justification: but
rather to follow the judgment of some of the Latin fathers, who sometimes
comprehending the benefit of sanctification under the name of justification,
seemed to make justification to consist in remission of sin and
sanctification. Whereunto I answer, that indeed the Papists pretend so much.
For the Council Sess. 6. cap. 7.
of Trent in express terms says, that justification is not remission of sins
alone, but also sanctification and renovation of the inner man: and to the like
purpose Bellarmine De Justice. lib. 2. cap. 6.
disputes, that justification does not consist in the remission of sins
alone, but also in inward renovation. And yet all this is but a mere
colorable pretense: For as they exclude from justification the imputation of
Christ's righteousness, by which only we have remission of sin: so they do
indeed and in truth exclude remission it self. And as in stead of imputation
of righteousness they have brought in infusion of justice: so in stead of
remission of sin by imputation of Christ's righteousness, they have brought
in the utter expulsion, extinction, deletion of sin by infusion of
righteousness. And for this they have some show of reason: For if they should
hold, that justification consists partly in remission, that is, in the
forgiveness, or not imputation of sin, and partly in renovation or
sanctification; then they must confess, that there are two formal causes of
justification, which Calvin Antidot. ad Sess. 6.
objected against the Council of Trent, (and may truly be objected against
such of the Fathers as held justification to consist, partly in remission, and
partly in renovation) and consequently should be forced to acknowledge two
ways of making men just, by one and the same act of justification: the one, by
imputation of that righteousness, by which being without us we have remission
of sin; the other, by infusion of righteousness inherent, by which sin is
expelled. But the Council of Trent does steadfastly hold, that there is but one
formal cause of justification, and that is infusion of justice, whereby sin
is expelled. What then becomes of remission of sin, which according both to
Scriptures and Fathers concurreth to justification? I say of it, as of
justification; the name is retained, but the thing is taken away.

. II. Here therefore I am to show two things; first, that the Papists The
Papists from justification exclude remission of sin.
from justification exclude remission of sin, by putting into the room
thereof the expulsion and extinction of sin, which belongs not to
justification, but to sanctification, and consequently do wholly abolish by
their doctrine the benefit of justification. Secondly, that remission of sin
is not the utter extinction or deletion thereof. As touching the former, when
Calvin objected against the Council of Trent, that it made two formal causes
of justification: De justif. Lib. 2. Cap. 2.
Bellarmine answers thus, the Council of Trent in express terms said, that
there is but one only formal cause of justification. Yea but, say we, the
Council seems to make two, viz. remission of sins and renovation. But,
says he, when the Council makes mention severally of remission of sin, and
of infusion of grace, it did it not to signify, that there is a twofold
formal cause of justification; but to declare, that there are two terms of
that motion which is called justification, or two effects of the same cause.
For there cannot be that mutation or translation, which the Council notes to
be in justification, unless by remission of sin a man cease to be wicked,
and by infusion of justice begin to be godly. But, says he, as the air, when
it is enlightened of the Sun, by the same light, which it receives, cease
to be dark, and begins to be lightsome. So a man by the same justice given
and infused by the Sun of righteousness cease to be unjust, the light of
grace expelling the darkness of sin; and begins to be just, the light of
grace succeeding the darkness of sin. And as in calefaction, which
similitude he uses elsewhere, the access of heat expels cold; so in
justification, the infusion of justice expels sin. This then is the
doctrine of the new Church of Rome; that in this mutation called justification
which they define to be Transitus a peccato ad justitiam.
a passage from sin to righteousness; though there be, as in all other
motions, duo termini, viz. sin, which is terminus a quo, and righteousness,
which is terminus ad quem; yet there are not two distinct actions concurring,
viz. remission or expulsion of sin, and infusion of righteousness; but one
and the same action, which is the infusion of justice expelling sin, even as
in calefaction, though there be two terms cold and hot, yet there are not two
actions, for the same action of fire which brings in heat, expels cold;
and so in illumination, there are two terms, darkness and light, but not two
actions; for one and the same act of the Sun, which brings light, drives
away darkness. Whereby it is evident, that by remission of sin the Papists
do not understand, as all men from the beginning of the world have understood,
pardoning, forgiving, not imputing sin; but the utter deletion, expulsion,
abolition of it: which Bellarmine calls De justif Lib. 2. Cap. 7.
veram remissionem, true remission, as if the pardoning of the offense and
taking away the guilt were not true remission:. secundo.
but this true remission they hold to be such, that in a man who is justified,
and has remission of sin, there is no sin remaining, and he only is to
be held a just man, in whom there is no sin. Thus then remission of sin is
by the Papists excluded from justification, and that brought in the room of
it, which belongs to that perfection of sanctification, whereunto none
attain in this life.

. III. Now, that the Papists grossly err in making remission of That
remission of sin is not the extinction of it.
sin to be the utter abolition or expulsion of it by infusion of
righteousness, may appear by these arguments: First, whereas in sin there
are two things to be considered, the guilt and the corruption, or Anomy
thereof; it is evident, that the guilt of sins past is taken away by
remission wholly and at once: the corruption is taken away by mortification
thereof, not wholly in this life, and at once, but by degrees, we being day by
day 2 Cor. 4. 19.
renewed in the inner man. The latter is the work of Gods Spirit within us.
The former is an action of God without us, such as is that of the Creditor in
remitting or forgiving a debt. And so the Scriptures conceive of remission. For
our sins are debts in respect of the guilt binding us over to punishment,
which we owe for them. When as God therefore remitteth the debt, releaseth
this obligation, forgiveth the punishment, he is said, to remit our sins.
This our Savior taught by the parables of the creditors and debtors, Matthew.
18. 23. Luke 7. 41. And thus he has taught us to pray, Matthew. 6. 12. Forgive
us our debts, as we forgive our debtors. How do we forgive? By not revenging
the offense, but laying aside all desire and purpose of revenge, by passing by
it, and as it were forgetting it, by covering it with Prove. 10. 12.
charity, by not imputing it, by being reconciled unto the party who has
offended us; not by a real taking away of the sin from the offender, but a
wiping of it out of our remembrance; not by expelling the offense out of the
offender, but out of our thoughts.

. IV. Thus in the Scriptures, to remit sin is not to abolish and To remit,
what it is in the Scriptures. See more Lib. 5. Cap. 3.
extinguish the sin it self, but to absolve from the guilt of sin, to
pardon and to forgive the debt, and to remit the punishment, to cover a man's
sin and not to impute it. And this plainly appears by these manifold
phrases which are used in the Scriptures to signify remission of sin, all
which import the taking away of the guilt, but none the utter abolishing of the
corruption. As first the Hebrew Salach, Exodus 34. 9. Numb. 14. 19, 20. 30. 6.
Deuteronomy. 29. 19. Psalm. 103. 3. Esaias 55. 7. Ier. 31. 34. Dan. 9. 20. signifies
parcere, remittere, ignoscere, condonare, propitium esse. Kasah, to hide, to
spare, to forgive, Nehem. 4. 5. Psalm. 32. 1. 85. 2. Joel 2. 17. Deuteronomy. 13. 8.
Kaphar also is to cover, to pardon, to be propitious, Deuteronomy. 21. 8. Psalm. 65. 4.
78. 38. 79. 9. Esaias. 22. 14. Nasa, to spare, to forgive, to take away the
guilt, Genesis 18. 24, 26. 50. 17. Exodus 32. 32. Numb. 14. 19. Psalm. 32. 1. cum
Romans 4. 7. Esaias 33. 24. Psalm. 25. 18. Habar, to pass by an offense, Mic. 7.
18. and Hehebir to cause it to pass, 2 Samuel 12. 13. 24. 10. Zech. 3. 4.
Machah, to wipe, or to blot out of remembrance the sins of men, as it were
out of a book, to blot them out from before his face, Nehem. 4. 5. Psalm. 51.
9. Ier. 18. 23. Hesir, to remove, Esaias 27. 9. Lo chashab not to impute, Psalm.
32. 2.

In like manner the Greek (...), to remit, or forgive, Mat. 6. 12, 14, 15. 18.
27, 32. whence is (...), remission, that is, (...), forgiveness, as Hesychii^s
expounds it. (...), condonare, to forgive, Luke 7. 42. 2 Cor. 2. 10. Ephesians.
4. 33. Col. 2. 13. 3. 13. (...) not to impute, Romans 4. 8. 2 Cor. 5. 19. So the
Latin, remittere, dimittere, ignoscere, condonare, donare, veniam dare,
parcere, propitium esse; and the English to remit, to pardon, to forgive.

. V. For the farther clearing of this point, let us consider these three
things; first, what that is which is remitted. Secondly, where it Three other
arguments.
remains until it be remitted. Thirdly, by what act of God it is remitted.
The thing remitted is our debt, Matthew. 6. 12. The subject where it remains
are the books of Gods providence and of our own consciences. The act of God in
remitting our debts is the wiping them out of his remembrance, as it were, his
debt-bookes The debt is the sin it self, which makes us debtors unto God.
And therefore sins First, the debt.
are called debts, and sinners debtors, Matthew. 6. 12. cum Luke 11. 4. Matthew.
23. 16, 18. Luke 13. 4. cum 2. which also appears by the parables of the
debtors, Luke 7. 41. Matthew. 18. 23, 35. and therefore sinners are called
debtors, because for their sins they owe punishment, unto which by the just
ordination of God they are obliged. This obligation, whereby sinners are bound
over to punishment, is called reatus, that is, guilt. When as therefore God
remitteth sins, he forgiveth the debt, he remitteth or releaseth the
punishment, he takes away the guilt, whereby we were bound over to
punishment. And e converso, when God forgiveth the debt, releaseth the
punishment, takes away the guilt, he is said to remit sin. Now sins are
either habitual or actual: An habitual sin God does remit, when he does
take away the guilt of it, Psalm. 32. 2.
and cover the Anomy of it, not that it should not be at all, but that it
should not be imputed, as Augustine De Nupt. and
says of concupiscence or original sin, whereof all particular habitual ^
sins are Concupisc. c. 25. 1 Col. 3. 5.
members and branches. Actual sins God does remit, when he does forgive the
sinful act Act. 8. 22.
it self, and the guilt also which remains after the act is past and gone.

. VI. But here the Papists have found out a new devise, to confirm their error
in confounding justification and sanctification; that whereas Whether remission
be of the macula.
there are two things, which as themselves do teach, Thom. 1. 2. ^ q. 87. art.
6. c. and ad. 1. (...).
remain in the soul after the act of sin has been committed, viz. reatus
and macula, the guilt and the blemish or spot; they teach against sense that it
is properly the macula which is remitted in justification. But then say I, what
becomes of the punishment, and the guilt binding over to punishment? It is
certain, that the infusion of righteousness does not take away the guilt, nor
free us from punishment. Neither can we be freed either from the one or the
other, but only by the satisfaction of Christ imputed unto us. Hence therefore
they should have learned to distinguish between justification and
sanctification, rather than to confound them, that whereas there are two things
remaining after sin committed, the guilt, and the pollution; the guilt is
taken away by imputation of Christ's righteousness in our justification; the
pollution is in some measure cleansed in our sanctification.

. VII. And how soever that, which they say of the macula or pollution That
which they say of the macula ^emaining is not altogether true.
remaining, is true in respect of Original sin, wherein, upon the guilt of
Adams transgression imputed, there follows an universal macula or
corruption, consisting of two parts, the privation of Original righteousness,
and an evil disposition and pronenesse to all manner of sin, by which
twofold corruption all the parts and faculties of the soul are defiled: yet it
seems not to be altogether true in regard of men's personal sins, in
respect of either part: for as touching the former part, which is the
privation; neither are the unregenerate by their actual sins deprived of
grace or righteousness infused, which they had not before they sinned: neither
are the regenerate utterly deprived of grace by such sins as they commit, as
I have elsewhere In the treatise of perseverance.
proved: and as touching the latter part, which is the evil disposition; this
macula, whereof they speak, is no new evil disposition making him a sinner
who before was not, but an evil disposition remaining of the old man, which by
committing of actual sins is increased. Insomuch as where the same actual
sin is often committed and reiterated, that evil disposition grows to be
an habit. For all evil dispositions or habitual sins, which are in men, are
either the reliquia or remnants of original sin in some measure mortified,
or the increments thereof, when by the committing of actual sins they
receive increase. And such a thing is that macula, whereof they speak: which
remaining in the soul per modum habitus, is to be taken away, as all other
habitual sins are, as they are pollutions, by the mortification Col. 3. 5.
of them; which is a part of sanctification and not of justification. Neither
is the mortification of sin a total deletion or abolition thereof in this
life, as if no sin or corruption remained in the party justified or
sanctified: for though in the forgiving or remitting of original sin, the
guilt be wholly taken away; yet the corruption, which is called concupiscence,
remains more or less mortified.

. VIII. Now follows the subject, where that, which is to be The book out of
which God does wipe our sins, when he does remit them.
remitted, does remain; and from whence, when it is remitted, it is wiped or
blotted out, that is, Gods remembrance and our conscience, which are as it were
the Lords debt-bookes, according to which books he will judge, Apoc. 20. 12.
the former is the book of Gods providence, Psalm. 56. 8. 139. 15. wherein all
offenses are written, and wherein they remain upon record, Hos. 7. 2. 8. 13.
Ier. 17. 1. The other is the book of our conscience, which is, as it were, the
Lords attorney indicting us of sin. In regard whereof David says, Psalm. 51.
3. I do know, or am conscious to my transgressions, and my sin is ever
before me. Out of the former book the Lord does wipe out sins, when he
justifies us in the Court of Heaven: out of the latter, when we are justified
in the Court of our own Conscience.

. IX. And hereby the third thing appears: namely, by what By what Act of God
our sins are remitted.
act of God our sins are remitted. For if that which is remitted be a debt,
which is recorded in Gods book: then this debt is remitted not by any act of
God within us, either really wiping the pollution out of our souls, or
infusing grace into them (both which are done in some measure after the debt is
remitted, in our sanctification) but by an act of God without us, wiping our
sins out of his book, blotting them out of his remembrance, Esai. 43. 25.
casting them behind his back, Esai. 38. 17. turning his face from them,
Psalm. 51. 9. not remembering, Ier. 31. 34. nor imputing them, Romans 4. 8. ex
Psalm. 32. 2. but forgiving and forgetting them, and accepting of Christ's
satisfaction for them in the behalf of all that truly believe in Christ, Romans
3. 24, 25.

. X. Our fifth argument may be this: The utter deletion of sin Our fifth
argument because the utter deletion of sin is not granted in this life.
is not granted in this life: Remission of sin is granted to the faithful in
this life: Therefore remission of sin is not the utter deletion of it.

The proposition is certain: For during this life sin remains in the best,
Romans 7. 17. 20. 1 Ioh. 1. 8.

The assumption is undeniable, as being an Article of our faith testified in
many places of Scripture.

Or thus: If in justification there were an utter deletion or abolition of
sin, then in those, that are justified, there is no sin.

But there is no mortal man, though justified, in whom there is no sin.

Therefore in justification there is not a Total deletion of sin.

. XI. Sixthly, if remission of sin be an utter deletion of the corruption
Sixthly, the guilt and punishment which are taken away in justification, are
not taken away by infusion of righteousness.
by infusion of righteousness, and nothing else concur to justification, but
infusion of righteousness expelling sin; what then becomes of the guilt of
sin and the punishment? how is our debt satisfied? The justice infused,
though it should utterly expel the corruption; yet it neither does nor can
satisfy for the punishment, as Bellarmine himself confesses. Neither is
there any other satisfaction or propitiation for our sins, whereby Gods
justice may be satisfied, our debt discharged, our selves freed from hell and
damnation, but only the satisfaction of Christ, without imputation whereof
there is no justification nor salvation: but none of this is done by
righteousness infused expelling sin. Wherefore the Papists, if they will be
saved, must acknowledge, besides the benefit of the infusion of righteousness
expelling the corruption of sin, which they call justification, but is indeed
sanctification, another greater benefit, whereby we are both freed from hell,
and entitled to heaven, by imputation of Christ's satisfaction, called in the
Scriptures justification, which they by their Antichristian doctrine have
utterly abolished.

. XII. Seventhly, that which works no real change in the party Seventhly,
remission does not work a real change.
does not really take away and expel all sin from him by infusion of
righteousness, for that cannot be done without a real, yea and a great
change in the party. True remission of sin does not work a real change in
the party. Therefore the true remission of sin does not really take away and
expel all sin by infusion of righteousness. The assumption is thus proved:
first, the forgiving of a debt works no real change in the debtor, but
relative. The true remission of sin is the forgiving of our debt, therefore
the true remission does not work a real change in the party. Secondly, that
which is imputative does not work a real change in the party but is an act
wrought without the party. True remission of sin is imputative, as the
Apostle teaches, Romans 4. 6, 7, 8. consisting in the not imputing of sin,
presupposing the imputing of righteousness without works, therefore it
works not a real change.

. XIII. My eighth argument is from theabsurdities which follow Eight
absurdities following on this Pop^h Doctrine.
upon this Popish Doctrine. First, Necessity of despairing, not only to the
tender conscience laboring under the burden of sin: but also to all not
cauterized consciences, which have any sense of their Ser. lib. 5. c. 5.. 6, 7,
8.
own estate. For if remission of sin be the utter deletion of sin, then
have not they, neither can they have remission of sin, in whom any sin
remains: and those, that neither have, nor can have remission of sin in
this life, because sin does ever remain in them, what remains to them but
despair? Secondly, that there is no necessity of the imputation of Christ's
righteousness for justification, because there is in them both a total
deletion of sin, and an infusion of perfect righteousness, whereby sin is
wholly expelled. And these, as you shall hear hereafter Lib. 5.
are two of Bellarmines De justis. l. 2. 6. 7.. secund^. and tertio.
principal Arguments to prove the imputation of Christ's righteousness to be
needless, both because, when our sins are remitted they are utterly
abolished; so that whosoever is justified is no longer a sinner in himself,
nor has any sin remaining in him; and also because in justification there is
an infusion of perfect righteousness. The third, that to remission of sin
there needs no favor or indulgence for pardon or forgiveness: for if
remission of sin be a total deletion of sin by infusion of perfect
righteousness, then without any accession of favor the one contrary is
necessarily expelled by the other. And this does Vasques profess in express
terms, Mihi semper In 1. ^ 2. ^ Disp. 204 n. 2.3.
necessarium visum fuit asserere, maculam peccati ipsa justitia inherente
tanquam forma contraria nullo accedente favore and condo natione deleri.

. XIV. These absurdities do necessarily follow upon their Antichristian
doctrine of justification by inherent righteousness: For if a man be justified
before God by inherent righteousness, then is he not a sinner in himself, and
consequently has no sin in him. And if by infusion of righteousness there
be a total deletion of sin, then must that righteousness, which is infused,
be perfect. For that which is unperfect cannot wholly expel sin, the
imperfection being of it self a sin; and if upon infusion of perfect
righteousness there does necessarily and of its own accord follow a total
deletion of sin, then to remission of sin favor and condonation is
needless. And yet we have not done with their absurdities: For to dream that
men who are but infants in Christianity, yea infants in age, before they have
the use of reason, or are capable of habits, are endued. and that ordinarily,
with perfect righteousness in their first imaginary justification, which is
inciptentium of such as be but incipients, whereunto the best proficients do
not in this life attain, is a monstrous absurdity.

CAP. VIII. Bellarmines dispute, that remission of sin is the utter deletion
of it, confuted.
De Justice. l. 2. cap. 7.
. I.

BUT how absurd soever their assertion is, Bellarmine will Bellarmines proof
out of the Scripture.
maintain it, and set a good face upon it: telling us first, that we may not
deny it, unless we will deny the Scriptures. For the Scripture, says he,
uses all manner of words to express the true remission of sin; so that if a
man would of purpose seek words to signify the utter abolition of sin, he
could not devise any which the Scripture has not already used. And to this
purpose cites eighteen Testimonies, nine out of the Old Testament, viz. 1 Chronicles. 21. 8. Esai. 44. 22. Ezekiel. 36. 25. Psalm. 51. 7. Prove. 15. 27. alias,
16. 6. Psalm. 103. 12. Mic. 7. 19. Psalm. 10. 15. Cant. 4. 7. And nine out of
the New, Ioh. 1. 29. Act. 3. 19. 1 Ioh. 1. 7. Act. 22. 16. Heb. 1. 3. 9. 28. 1
Cor. 6. 11. Ephesians. 5. 8. and 27.

. II. Answ. These places are to be distinguished: for either they Places, which
mention the taking away of sin.
are alleged to prove the abolition of sin, or perfection of righteousness:
the former mention, either the taking away of sin or the wiping or blotting
of it out, or the purging of it, or the not being of it. For the taking away of
sin, these are brought, 1 Chronicles. 21. 8. Psalm. 1 C^ron. 21. 8.
103. 12. Mic. 7. 19: Ioh. 1. 29. Heb. 9. 28. In 1 Chronicles. 21. 8. the word is
Hahaber, transire fac, cause it to pass, that is, remove it out of thy sight;
not that it be not at all, but that it be not punished, or which is all one,
take away the guilt: and so the word seems to be expounded, 2 Samuel 12. 13.
where Nathan says to David, the Lord 2 Samuel 12. 13. Psalm. 103. 12.
has taken away thy sin, thou shall not dye. Psalm. 103. 12. how far the
East is distant from the West, so far has he made Hirchiq.
our sins to be distant from us: which is not understood of the corruption
extinguished, but of the guilt removed or taken away. Mic. 7. 19. Mic. 7. 19.
thou will cast all their sins into the depth of the Sea, that is, he will
cast them out of his sight or remembrance, he will cast them behind his
back, he will bury them in oblivion, that they should not be seen or
remembered. Ioh. 1. 29. The Lamb of God which takes away, or Io^. 1. 2^.
takes upon him the sin of the world, (...) is the translation of Nose: and
the Verb Nasa having reference to finn^, when it is attributed to God, it
signifies to forgive, as has before been showed; and likewise when it is
attributed to men, who have been offended, Genesis 50. 17. 1 Samuel 15. 25. 25. 28.
when it is attributed to Christ our redeemer, as in the place alleged, it
signifies, that he takes away our sins by taking them upon him, or bearing
them: as it is said of the escape Goat, the figure of Christ, Levit. 16. 22. and
so that place, Ioh. 1. 29. is to be Levit. 16. 22. Merc^r in the sauro. Voce
Nasa.
understood. Nasa, says one, sometimes does signify tollere, that is to take
up, and to bear, (as when we are commanded tollere crucem, to take up our
cross) or to take upon him, which Saint John the Evangelist renders by the
Verb (...): and this is fully expressed by the Prophet, Esaias 53. 12. Es. 53.
12.
that Christ Nasa did bear the sin of many: as before verse 4. that he has
borne (the Verb is Nasa) our griefs, and carried our forrowes, and verse. 11.
he shall bear their iniquities. Heb. 9. 28. Christ was Heb. 9. 28.
once offered ad multorum exhaurienda peccata, that is, as our Rhemists
translate, to exhaust the sin of many. The word is (...), to take up and to
bear: the meaning is, that Christ was offered upon the cross, that he might
tak^ up and bear our sins, even as S. Peter speaks to the like effect, 1
Epist. 2. 24. who himself did bear our sins in his own 1 P^t. 2. 24.
body upon the tree, that is, the Cross: where the same Verb is used, and is
by the Latin interpreted pertulit, and by the Rhemists, bear our sins.

. III. Other places are alleged, which mention the deletion, Places, which
mention the blotting out of finne
that is, the wiping or blotting out of sin, Psalm. 51. 1. 9. Act. 3. 19. Esa.
44. 22. But I ask, from whence? Delere, says Vatablus, in Psalm. 51. 10.
est metaphora ab iis qui delent, qui prius in rations scripserant, to wipe
out is a metaphore from those, who wipe out such things, as before they had
written upon their account, or in their debt-bookes. The book is Gods
remembrance, out of which those things are wiped which are forgotten: and thus
deletion is often ascribed to Deuteronomy. 31. 21. Est. 9. 28. Eccl ^. 4. Ier. 23. 4^,
50, 5. Es. 43. 25.
oblivion. For Gods wiping out of sins is his blotting them out of his
remembrance: and so it is expounded, Es. 43. 25. his not remembering them. Psalm.
25. 7. 79. 8. Ier. 31. 34. as contrariwise, his not blotting them out, is his
remembering of them, his not forgiving them. Ier. 18. 23. forgive not their
iniquity, neither Ier. 18. 23.
blot out their sin from thy sight. Psalm. 109. 14. Let the iniquity of his
Psalm. 109. 14.
father be remembered with the Lord; and let not the sin of his mother be
blotted out, ( ne deleatur, id est, non tradatur oblivioni,) but let them be
before the Lord continually, verse 15. And thus David prays, Psalm. 51. 9.
hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities, Psalm. 51. 9.
namely out of thy remembrance: and no more can be gathered out of Act. 3. 19.
that your sins may be blotted out (of Gods book) where Act. 3. 19.
Tremellius notes it to be a metaphore taken from those who keep books of
account, etc. Howsoever, it is not to be doubted, but that before the day of
judgment, whereof Saint Peter there speaks, there shall be a total deletion
of the sins of the faithfu^l, both in respect of the guilt, and also of the
pollution. As for Es. 44. 22. the Lord professes Es. 44. 22.
his reconciliation with Israel in taking away their sins, which as a cloud,
yea as a thick cloud had hid his face from them: the guilt whereof being taken
away, the light of his countenance did shine upon Numb. 6. 25. Psalm. 4. 6.
them. Howbeit Tremellius and Innius read, Deleo ut densa nubes defectiones
tuas, according to which reading, that place has affinity with those, which
mention washing, cleansing, purging; of which ^ am now to speak.

. IV. Of these, some are to be understood of justification and taking Places
which mention the purging of sin Psalm. 51. 2. 7.
away the guilt of sin, as all the first part of the 51. Psalm, which is a
prayer for the pardon of sin; out of which are cited verse 2. and 7. where
David prays, that God would wash him, and cleanse him from his sin, namely
by the blood of Christ: for that is it which 1 John 1. 7.
cleanses us from all our sins. Purge me with hyssope which was the (...)
(wherewith they used to sprinkle the Levit. 14. 6. Number. 19. 18. Heb. 9. 19.
blood upon those which were cleansed) that is, sprinkle me with the blood of
that eternal sacrifice of Christ prefigured in the Law, without which blood
Heb. 9. 22.
being shed, there was no remission. And there is no doubt but the blood of
Christ was shod for the remission of sins, Mat. 26. 29. and that our
conscienc^s Heb. 9. 14.
(the seat of guiltiness) might be purged from dead works. The words
following, and I shall be whiter than snow, do plainly argue the purity, not
of sanctification (for to such a degree thereof we never attain in this life)
but of justification: in respect whereof our souls being perfectly just, are
whiter than snow. Some are to be understood of sanctification, as Ezekiel. 36. 25.
Some of both, as 1 Cor. 6. 11. Act. 22. 16. 1 Ioh. 1. 7. Heb. 1. 3. but with
this difference, that we are cleansed and purged from the guilt of sin past,
wholly and at once: but from the corruption in part, and by degrees in this
life, wherein we are to be renewed 2 Cor. 4. 16.
in the inner man from day to day. The Corinthians, to whom the Apostle gives
this 1 Cor. 6. 11.
testimony, that they were washed, etc. were far from perfection of inherent
righteousness, as appears by that Epistle; wherein he calls them carnal,
and reproves them both for their errors in judgment, and for their
misdemeanors in their conversation. That which he cites out of Pro. 15. per
mifericordiam and fidem purgantur peccata, is found in the Latin, v. 27. but
not in the original: the like sentence is found Pro. 16. 6. but there the
Verb purgatur, for which the Text is alleged, is not used in the Latin.

. V. For the not being of sin, he alleges, Psalm. 10. 15. alias For the not
being of sin. Psalm. 10. 15.
9. 35. quaeretur peccatum illius, and non inveniatur, against the true meaning
of the place, it being not a prayer for the justification or sanctification of
the wicked, that his sin may be no more, as Bellarmine absurdly expounds
it; dicet peccatum fuisse and non esse: but is a prophetical imprecation
against the wicked, that God would break their arm, that is, their power and
strength: and that when he, as a judge, should inquire into their wickedness,
they should not be found (according to that Prove. 10. 25. he shall be no more,
that is, as Augustine expounds Prove. 10. 25.
it, that the wicked, when he is judged, shall perish for his sin. And so
Vatabius, make inquiry into his sin, thou shall not find him, neither does
the Psalmist say, non invenietur ipsum, scil. peccatum, sed non invenietur
ipse, scilicet peccator, not it, but he shall not be found.

. VI. For the perfection of righteousness he alleges three Places for the
perfection of righteousness, Ephesians. 5. 8.
places, two out of Ephesians. 5. verse. 8. Ye were sometimes darkness, but now
light in the Lord; where the abstract Light is put for the concrete Lightsome,
as being enlightened, as the Children of Light: not that they are that light in
which there 1 Ioh. 1. 5.
is no darkness. Neither is it said, that we are in our selves Light, but,
notwithstanding that darkness, which remains in us, we are Light in the
Lord. The second Ephesians. 5. 26, 27.
place is, Ephesians. 5. 26, 27. where it is said, that Christ did give himself
for his Church, that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of
water by the word, that he might present it to himself a glorious Church, not
having spot or wrinckle, or any such thing; but that it should be Holy and
without blemish. In which words there is no mention of justification, but of
sanctification, which in this life is begun and increased by the work of the
Spirit in the Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, that at the Marriage of the
Lamb it may be presented unto him, a glorious Church, not having spot or
wrinckle, etc. Wherefore Augustine, Retract. lib. 1. c. 19. the like he has
lib. de persectione justific. p. 975. Col. 3. ^.
That which I said, says he, that God has chosen unto himself a glorious
Church, I did not therefore speak it, because now it is altogether such;
though no doubt she was chosen, that she might be such, when Christ who is her
life, shall appear: for ^en she also with him shall appear in glory; for
which glory she is called a glorious Church. And again, Retract. lib. 2. cap.
18.
wheresoever I mentioned the Church not having spot or wrinckle, it is not so
to be taken, as though now it were, but because it is prepared to be such,
when she also shall appear glorious. And the same answer will serve for the
third place cited out of the Canticles 4. 7. Tota pulchraes, and macula non est
in te, Cant. 4. 7.
thou are all fair, there is no spot in thee; unless perhaps he speak of the
beauty of the Spouse adorned in her justification with the perfect
righteousness of Christ; for of her Sanctification, which is but begun in this
life, it is not true. But the Papists are without shame, who apply such texts
of Scripture to the now Church of Rome.

. VII. Besides these places of Scripture, Bellarmine says, many Bellarmines
arguments out of his book de Baptismo, lib. 1. cap. 13.
other very weighty arguments might be brought; but he has already produced
them in his first book De Baptismo, cap. 13. which when they shall call come
to be weighed, will be found light enough. For those places, which speak of
the efficacy of Baptism, in washing, cleansing and taking away our sins,
prove not, that in justification sins are utterly abolished. For in Baptism
is sealed to them that are Baptized, yea, and conferred to the faithful, the
benefits, not only of justification, but also of sanctification. And therefore
as it is the Sacrament of remission of sin, and the seal Romans 4. 11.
of that righteousness which is by faith: so it is called the Laver Tit. 3. 5.
of regeneration, wherein we are Baptized into the similitude Romans 6. 3, 4.
of Christ his death and resurrection. And therefore, though in Baptism sin
were wholly taken away, as well in respect of the corruption, as of the guilt:
yet it would not follow, that in justification there is a Total deletion of
sin. But neither in Baptism is there a total abolition of sin; seeing it is
manifest, that original sin, which is called the flesh, the old man, and
evil concupiscence, remains in all the faithful, though in some measure
mortified, yet never fully and altogether extinguished in this life. And
although the Papists for maintenance of their several errors, viz. of
justification by inherent righteousness, of the perfect fulfilling of the Law,
of merit, of works of supererogation, do maintain, that concupiscence,
remaining in the faithful after Baptism, is not a sin; and the Council of
Trent Sess. 5. c. 5.
has denounced Anathema against them that shall say it is a sin: yet it is
manifest, not only by the testimony of antiquity, and evident reasons, which I
could produce, if I would run into another controversy; but also by the
doctrine of the Apostle; who does not only in many places Romans 6. 12. 7 8. 11.
13. 17. 20. 23. 8. 10. Heb. 12. 1.
expressly call it a sin, and describes it as a sin, but also sets it
forth as the mother of sin, the sinning sin; which because it takes
occasion by the Commandment forbidding lust, to work in men all manner of
evil concupiscence, is not only convinced to be a sin, but also to be Romans
7. 8. 13.
(...), exceedingly sinful. Concupiscence a sin.


. VIII. And not only habitual concupiscence in general which is the Romans 6. 6.
body of sin, and the body 7. 24.
of death (in respect of which sin, the body of the faithful is said to be
dead, Romans 8. 10.) is sin: but also the several members and branches
thereof, which remain even in the best, are so many habitual sins: as a
spice at the least of pride, self-love, carnal security, infidelity,
hypocrisy, envy, worldly and carnal love of pleasure, profit, preferment and
glory in this world, etc. Which, though they be not imputed to the faithful,
yet in themselves are sins, as being (...), swervings from the Law of God; not
only as defects of righteousness (which were enough to make them sins) but
as positive vices. Neither is it to be doubted, but that as the acts of pride
and other habitual vices remaining even in the best are sins; so, much more
the vices themselves, from which they proceed, are sins, and are by the same
Commandment of the Law forbidden. Now whatsoever is (...) is sin: For as
every sin is (...), 1 John 3. 4.
so every (...) is a sin, that being a perfect definition of sin, as
Bellarmine himself confesses, De amiss gratiae and statu peccati, lib. 2. ca.
18.
Non potuit rectius and brevius definiri peccatum, quam ut a S. Ioanne fuit
definitum illis verbis, (...). But all evil concupiscence, both habitual and
actual; both in general the body of sin, and in particular the several
branches, being so many habitual sins, in whomsoever they are found, even in
the most regenerate, are (...), aberrations from the law of God. Therefore all
evil concupiscence whatsoever, in whomsoever remaining, is a sin.

. IX. Yea, but concupiscence is no sin unless the Will consent unto Object.
that concupiscence without consent is no sin.
it. Then, say I, not a sin in infants not baptized. But the Law does not
say, non consenties concupiscentiis, sed omnino non concupisces: thou shall not
consent to concupiscences, but thou shall not have any evil concupiscence at
all. And it is most evident, that the concupiscence forbidden in the tenth
Commandment, is such as goes before the consent of will. For it is such, as
Saint Paul himself had not known to be sin, if the Law had not said, Romans
7. 7.
Non concupisces, thou shall not covet. But such concupiscences, as have the
consent of the will, the very Heathen knew to be sins. And the Papists
themselves must acknowledge them to be forbidden in the former Commandments,
unless they will deny the Law of God to be spiritual Rom 7. 14.
and prefer the (...), corrupt interpretations of the Elders of the Jews
before the exposition of the Lawgiver himself, Ma^th. 5. 28.
Matthew. 5. True therefore is that, which some Writers cite out of De Nupti^s
and Concupis^. lib. 1. cap 25.
Augustine, that Original sin is remitted in Baptism, not that it be not,
but that it be not imputed unto sin. Here Bellarmine takes on, and says, that
Luther first falsified this testimony of Augustine, and that all who have
followed him, have continued the same fault, though they have been told of it.
A great accusation, if true. Augustines words in answer to an objection,
(which the Papists cannot answer) how can original sin be transmitted from
regenerate parents, if in Baptism it be wholly taken from them, are these: I
answer, says he, dimitti concupiscentiam in baptismo, non ut non sit, sed ut
in peccatum non imputetur. Where Augustine speaking of the traduction of
original sin, calls it (as his manner is) Concupiscence, in stead whereof,
some of our Writers have said sin, both Augustine and they meaning nothing
else, but original. Now, that Augustine by that which he calls
Concupiscence, meant sin, hereby appears; first, he says it is remitted in
Baptism, and remission is of debts only, and of sins, as debts; secondly,
because he says it is remitted, not that it should not be any longer, but
that (though it be a sin, yet) it should not be imputed unto sin; for
nothing is wont to be imputed unto sin by God, but that which is sin. Where
by the way we may observe, that in Augustines judgment remission of sin is
not the utter deletion of it, that it be no more, but the not imputing of it.
For whereas the Papists for a poor shift and evasion say, that Concupiscence
is called sin, not because it is a sin, sed quia expeccato est, and ad
peccatum inclinat; this hinders not its being a sin, but rather sets
forth the greatness of this evil, as having all the respects of evil in it:
being both a sin, and a punishment of sin, and the cause of all other
sins, a^ Augustine says, Contr. Julian. lib. 5. cap. 3. Bellarmines
unanswerable argument out of Romans 5. 19.
Concupiscentia carnis adversus quam bonus concupiscit Spiritus (sc. in
renatis) and peccatum est, and poena peccati, and causa pecca^i.

. X. But howsoever Bellarmine lets pass (as well he might) his other
arguments alleged in his Book of Baptism, as impertinent to this present
question; yet one of them he has thought good not to omit, as being in his
conceit De justif. l. 2. c. 7.. multa.
unanswerable; which notwithstanding I have not only answered elsewhere Lib.
2. c. 5.. 1. 2. l. 4. c. 9.. 2, 3, 4.
, but also have used it as an invincible argument Lib. 5. c. 2.. 1.
to prove justification by imputation of Christ's righteousness, viz. the
argument taken from the antithesis of Adam to Christ, Romans 5. 19. which
Bellarmine here straineth beyond the extent of the antithesis made by the
Apostle. In other places Bellarmine has thus argued: As through Adams
disobedience we were made sinners, so through Christ's obedience we are made
righteous: but through Adams disobedience we were made truly sinners, namely
by unrighteousness inherent, and not only Non ^ola imputatione de bap^is. l.
1. c. 13.
by imputation. Therefore through the obedience of Christ we are made truly
righteous, namely by righteousness inherent. But here, to serve his present
turn, he alters both the assumption and the conclusion. The assumption; for
where before he said, not only by imputation, here he says, not by
imputation. The conclusion: for first, in stead of concluding, that we are by
the obedience of Christ made inherently just, which we confess, though not
intended by the Apostle in that place; he concludes, that the obedience of
Christ has truly taken away and wiped out or abolished all our sins. And
secondly, that he has taken away our sins non imputa^ive, sed vere, not by
imputation, but truly. His former argument I retorted after this manner:

As through Adams disobedience we were made sinners, that is, guilty of death
and damnation: so by Christ's obedience we are made just, that is, absolved
from that guilt, and accepted as righteous unto eternal life.

But by imputation of Adams disobedience we were made sinners.

Therefore by imputation of Christ's obedience we are made righteous.

The assumption, that we were made sinners by imputation of Adams disobedience,
I proved, as by other arguments, so by Bellarmines own confession in other
places. Secondly, I have acknowledged it to be true, that as we are made
truly sinners through Adams disobedience, not only by imputation of Adams
sin, but also by transfusion of both that privative and positive corruption,
which by that disobedi- ence he contracted: so we are made truly just through
the obedience of Christ, not only by imputation of his obedience, but also by
infusion of righteousness from him. But though we be truly made just by
righteousness inherent yet it follows not, that we are in this life made
perfectly just. Neither does it follow, that because Christ does free us from
the dominion of sin, we are therefore freed wholly from the being of sin in
us: neither, that if we be freed from sin by imputation, we are not freed
truly. For the Apostle uses these terms promiscuously, remitting of sin and
not imputing of sin, justifying and imputing righteousness. And as Christ ^
Cor. 5. 21
was truly and really made a sacrifice for sin in our behalf: so we are
truly and indeed made the righteousness of God in him.

Thus have I proved, that neither remission of sin is the abolishing of
sin, nor justification all one with sanctification: and that the Papists by
confounding justification and sanctification, and of these two making but one,
have utterly taken away and abolished out of their Divinity, that great benefit
of our justification.

A TREATISE OF JUSTIFICATION.
THE THIRD BOOK: Concerning Justification or saving Grace.
CAP. I. What is meant by the word Grace in the Question of Justification.
. I.

THE second Capital error of the Papists in the Papists by grace understand
the habits of grace in us.
Article of justification, is concerning justifying and saving grace. For when
as the holy Ghost would note unto us (...) the first moving cause or motive in
God, the principium or primary cause (which some call (...)) of our
justification, he says, that we are justified by the Romans 3 24. Tit. 3. 7.
Ephesians. 2. 8.
grace of God, Romans 3. 24. Tit. 3. 7. that we are saved by his grace, Ephesians.
2. 8. meaning thereby the gracious favor of God in Christ, whereby (...)
Ephesians. 1. 6.
he has graciously accepted and embraced us in his beloved: They, most
absurdly and wickedly, that they may place the matter of their justification,
and merit of their salvation in themselves, do by grace understand the gifts
of grace, and namely and especially that of Charity, habitually inherent in us.
For so they teach, justifying grace to be a divine Catech. Romans 38.
quality inherent in the soul per modum habitus, a supernatural habit infused
of God: and that, not really distinct B^llarm. de gratia and lib. arb. l. 1. c.
3. and 6.
from Charity. And in like manner, what in this kind is said of the Romans 5. 5.
8. 35.
Love of God, they understand it commonly, not of Gods Love, whereby he loves
us; but of our love; whereby we love God.

II. For the better understanding of this point, we are to distinguish The
diverse acceptions of the word Grace.
the diverse acceptions of Gods grace. For either it signifies the favor of
God in himself, or the gifts of grace in us. The former is the proper
signification: for the grace of God, properly understood, is one of Gods
attributes; whereby he is signified to be gracious, and is referred to his
goodness, Exodus 33. 19. cum 34. 6. unto which also Exo. 33. 19. 34. 6.
his love and mercy are referred; but with this distinction. For Gods goodness
is considered either Exodus 34. 6. Psalm. 119. 68.
as he is good in himself, yea goodness it self; or as he is good to his
creatures, which is his bounty, which, being referred to his creatures, (...).
145. 7, 8, 9.
either as having goodness communicated to them, is his love; or as being in
misery, is his mercy, or as having deserved no good thing at the hands of God,
but the contrary, is his Grace. The latter signification is unproper and
metonymicall, the word Grace being taken for the effects of his grace, viz. his
free and undeserved gifts and benefits proceeding from his grace and favor:
which are not properly called the grace and favor of God, but his graces and
favors, not (...) the grace, but (...), the gifts of grace, Romans 11. 28. 1
Cor. 1. 7. 12. 4. 31. And in both senses it is either more largely taken for
any favor or favors of God though common, as both his favor and love in
creating, preserving and governing his creatures; and also the fruits thereof,
which are his common favors, as the gifts of nature (in which sense Pelagius
did call bonum naturae, and namely free will, the grace of God) and the gifts
dispensed by his providence, as his temporal blessings which he graciously
bestows upon both good and bad, Matthew. 5. 45. In which respect he is not
only said to be channun, Psalm. 111. 4. I^n. 4. 2.
gracious, Exodus 22. 27. and graciously to bestow such gifts, Genesis 33. 5. 11.
Esai. ^6. 10. but also to be the Savior of all men, 1 Timothy 4. 10. yea to save
both man and beast, Psalm. 36. 6. Or else it is used more specially to signify
the peculiar favor and favors of God vouchsafed to his peculiar people, viz.
the Church, tending to the salvation of it and of the members thereof, which is
the usual acception of the word in the Scripture.

III. This by the Schoolmen is very unfitly distinguished into The Schoolemens
distinction of Grace.
gratia gratum faciens, and gratia gratis da^a: for first, out of this
distinction, that, which chiefly and properly is to be called grace, viz. the
gracious love and favor of God in Christ, is left out. Secondly, whereas by
gratia gratum faciens, the justifying, and saving grace, they mean grace
infused, and namely the habit of Charity, they oppose it to gratia gratis data,
to grace freely given, as if the grace infused were not also freely given. But
they might have learned either from their Master Lib. 2. did. 27. D.
a better distinction of Grace, though he do but lightly touch upon it, that
Grace is either gratia gratis Dans, gratia gratis Data, or a better exposition
of that distinction, which they have propounded, according to the Scriptures:
that by Gratia gratum faciens is meant the gracious favor of God in himself,
whereby he graciously accepts us in his Beloved; and by gratia gratis data,
the gifts of grace freely bestowed upon us: for so the Apostle seems to
distinguish Romans 5. 15. that it is either

(...), the grace of God in himself: (...), or as he speaks, Ephesians. 3. 7.
(...), the gift of grace in us:
Or as elsewhere,

(...), the grace of God: (...), the gifts of grace.
The former, is the gracious favor of God, and is in God the giver of all good
gifts, as the fountain of all graces: the latter, are the gifts of grace, and
are in the receivers as streams derived from that fountain.

Now these (...), or gifts of grace, are either sanctifying graces Romans 11. 28.
, tending to the salvation of him who is endued with them, as faith, hope,
charity, the fear of God, etc. or edifying Romans 12. 6. 1 Timothy 4. 14. 1 Pet. 4.
10. Ephesians. 4. 7. 11. 12.
graces, which are given for the salvation of others: and those, either
ordinary, as the gifts of the ministry; or extraordinary, 1 Cor. 12. 8, 9, 10,
28.
as the gifts of prophecy, of tongues, of working miracles, which the
Schoolmen called gratias gratis datas.

. IV. These (...), these gifts of grace, whether you understand those edifying,
or those sanctifying graces, may every one of them by a metonymy The state of

11.
, the saving grace of God or gratia gratum faciens; of which this question is
understood, to wit, whether this justifying and saving grace of God be in^erent
in us, as a quality or habit, or be out of us in God, as being one of his
attributes. The Papists say, it is inherent in us, per modum habitus, after the
manner of an habit infused into us; and so is the matter of justification,
considered as an action of God, as we conceive of justification; or the form,
as they say, speaking of justification passively, and confounding it with
sanctification. But we, though we do confess, that in the gifts of saving
grace, as faith, hope, charity, etc. concurring in us, our inward or habitual
sanctification does consist: yet we deny them, or any one of them to be either
the matter or form of justification. But contrariwise we constantly affirm,
that the justifying and saving grace of God, or, as they speak, gratia gratum
faciens, is the gracious favor of God in Christ, which is out of us in him,
concurring to our justification, neither as the matter nor form, but as the
efficient cause thereof. Against which assertion the accursed Numb. 24. 9.
Council of Trent Sess. 6. can. 11. Si quis dixerit g^atiam qua ju
stisicamuresse tantum savo* rem Deianathema sit.
has denounced Anathema, If any man shall say, that the grace, by which we are
justified, is only the favor of God, let him be accursed. But first I will
produce our proofs; and then answer their objections.

CAP. II. Our proofs, that by the Grace of God, by which we are justified, is
meant the gracious favor of God in Christ.
. I.

THe Papists, for all their cursing, are not able to 1 The use of the word in
the Scripture.
produce any one pregnant testimony to prove, that the grace, whereby we are
justified, is inherent in us. But, that Grace does signify that favor of God,
we are able out of the New Testament to allege above fifty testimonies,
whereof some shall hereafter be cited. And as for the Old Testament, it is
evident, that the Hebrew Chen, chani. nsh Jer. 16. 13. Techinnah. Ios. 11. 20.
Chesed Psalm. 40. 11. symmach. Ps. 136. 1, etc. 2 Samuel 16. 17.
words which signify the grace of God, and are to be translated by the word
grace, do always signify favor, and never grace inherent. As, if I have
found grace in thy sight, Genesis 18. 3. Ex. 33. 13. 17. God gave Joseph grace in
the sight of the keeper, Genesis 39. 21. and the people of Israel grace in the
sight of the Egyptians, Exodus 3. 21. In which sense the blessed Virgin is said
to have found grace with God, Luke 1. 30. and our Savior to have increased in
grace with God and man, Luke 2. 52.

. II. Secondly, that grace whereby the Lord (...) gratos fecit, 2. It is gratia
gratum faciens, because by it God (...) us gracious.
made us gracious or graciously accepted us in his beloved, is gratia gratum
faciens, that is, the justifying and saving grace.

By the gracions love and favor of God in Christ, which is out of us in him,
the Lord (...) has made us gracious, or graciously accepted us in his beloved,
and not by any gift of grace inherent in us.

Therefore the gracious love and favor of God in Christ is gratia gratum
faciens, that is, the justifying and saving grace, and not any gift of grace
inherent in us.

The proposition is in it solfe evident. The assumption is proved out of Ephesians.
1. Blessed be God, who has blessed us in Christ with all spiritual blessings
-- according as he has elected us in him before the foundation of the world --
having predestined us unto the adoption of children -- to the praise of the
glory of his grace, wherein or whereby (...) id est, gratos fecit, he has
made us accepted in his beloved, in whom we have redemption through his blood
even forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, verse 3, 4,
5, 6. 7. For by or in that grace, to the glorious praise whereof the Lord
elected us before the foundation of the world, and according to the riches
whereof we are redeemed by Christ, the Lord has graciously accepted us in his
beloved. But it were very absurd to say, that God has elected us to the praise
of the glory of our Charity, or that we are redeemed according to the riches
of our charity. But we were elected to the praise of the glory of his grace,
that is, of his gracious love and bounty in Christ, which grace was given unto
us in Christ before all secular 2 Timothy 1. 9.
times: and according to the riches of this grace he has redeemed us by
Christ. Wherefore gratia gratum faciens, the grace, by which we are justified,
is not any gift of grace inherent in us, but the eternal grace and favor of
God vouchsafed unto us in Christ, before the foundation of the world, and
before all secular times.

. III. In respect of this grace, whereby the Lord (...)graciously In respect of
this grace the faithful are (...) and chasidim.

accepted or graced, or as it is expounded verse 30. that she had found grace
and favor with God. And so may all the elect and faithful children of God be
called (...); as in many places of the Old Testament they are in the very same
sense, called chasidim passively understood. Especially, where that word is
read with the Affix or Pronoune betokening God, to signify his chasidim the
favorites of God: and thus it is read with the Affix of the first Person, when
God is the speaker, calling them Chasidai, Psalm. 50. 5.
my favorites: or of the second whenthe speech is directed unto God, and then
they are called in the plural Chasideica, thy favorits, Psalm. 52. 9. 79. 2.
132. 9. 145. 10. and in the singular Chasideca thy favorite, Deuteronomy. 33. 8.
Psalm. 16. 10. 89. 19. or of the third person in the singular Chasido, his
favorite, or Chasidso, So the 72. and the Latin (...), sanctum s^um
Psalm. 4. 3. and in the plural Chasidain, his favorites. Psalm. 31. 24. 85. 9.

Vatablus interpret it, quos benignitate prosequitur, those whom God does
specially favor, those who have found grace with God; which commonly are
translated Saints, and so are all the faithful usually called, even in the New
Testament Romans 1. 7. 8. 27. 12. 13. 15. 25. 31. 10. 2. 15 1 Cor. 6. 1. 14. 33,
etc.
as the translation of the Hebrew chasidim: sanctity not being the cause of
Gods favor, which is eternal, but the proper badge and cognizance of those,
who are the favorites of God, by which they are known.

And further out of the same place, Ephesians. 1. 6. where it is said that by The
grace of Christ, that is, thegracious favor of God in Christ.
this grace he has made us gracious in his beloved it is plainly proved,
that by it is meant the gracious favor of God toward us in Christ, in which
respect it is also called the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Act. 15. 11. So
Romans 16. 20. 1 Cor. 16. 23. 2 Cor. 13. 14. Gal. 1. 6. 6. 18. Phi. 4. 23. 1 Thessalonians. 5. 28. 2 Thessalonians. 3. 18. Philem. 25. Apoc. 22. 21. and to the same effect
it is called the love of Christ, Romans 8. 35. that is, as it is expressed verse.
39. the love of God which is in Christ. Which places cannot without absurdity
be understood of that grace of God, or of that love of God, which is in us,
that is to say of our love of God. Arg. 3 by the gracious favor of God we are
elected, called, etc.


. IV. Thirdly, by what grace of God we are elected, called, redeemed,
reconciled, adopted, saved, by the same we are justified.

But by the gracious favor of God, by which he has graciously accepted of us
in his beloved, and not by any thing in us, we were elected according to the
(...) of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace, Ephesians. 1. 5, 6 for
which cause our election unto life is called the election of grace, Romans 11. 5.
By grace we are effectually called, according to Romans 8. 28.
his purpose. For God has called us with an holy calling, not according to our
works, but according to his own purpose of grace, which (grace) was given us
in Christ Jesus, before all secular times, but is now made manifest by the
appearing of our Savior, 2 Timothy 1. 9. By his gracious favor in Christ, God
has redeemed us, reconciled us unto himself adopted us, and not by our
charity, or any thing in us. And finally, by his gracious favor we are saved
through faith, and not of works or of any grace or righteousness iuherent in
us, that he might show the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindness
toward us through Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 2. 7, 8. Therefore by the gracious favor
of God in Christ, and not by any grace inherent in us, the Lord does justify
us: and therefore the sacred fathers of Trent must take home to themselves
(according to the censure of the Apostle, Gal. 1. 8. 9.) that Anathema, which
they denounce against those, who say, that the grace whereby we are justified
is only the gracions favor of God in Christ.

. V. Against the proposition if it be objected, that the grace of Object. 1
that the grace of election is eternal.
election is eternal, but the benefit of vocation and the rest is temporal,
and therefore not the same: I answer, that although the benefit of vocation and
of the rest be given us in time yet the grace, by which we are called,
justified, and saved, is eternal, 2 Timothy 1. 9. And therefore Bellarmines
distinction of grace De gratia at lib, arbitr. lib. 1. cap. 2.
into eternal, by which we were elected; and temporary, by which we are
called, and justified, is idle and to no purpose.

. VI. If again it be objected, that by what grace we are sanctified, Object.
2. of the grace of sanctification.
by the same we are justified: by inherent grace we are sanctified, therefore
by inherent grace we are justified: I answer by distinction of the phrase by
grace: for if thereby be meant the efficient cause, then I confess the
proposition, to wit, that by what grace we are sanctified, we are also
justified. For the same gracious favor of God is the efficient cause as well of
our sanctification, as of our justification; and I deny the assumption. But if
by that phrase be meant the essential c^use, that is, the matter or the form
of our sanctification: then I confess the assumption, and deny the
proposition: For by the inherent graces (wherein our habitual sanctification
consists) we are sanctified: but we are justified not by any grace inherent,
but only by the righteousness of Christ: as I have showed before, and
hereafter shall fully prove in its due place. For we are justified by the
grace, that is, the gracious favor of God in Christ, Romans 3. 24.
gratis in respect of us, that is, without any cause or desert in us, through
the redemption which is in Christ, without the works of the Law, that is,
without respect of any obedience performed by us, or righteousness inherent in
us, that is prescribed in the Law, which is the perfect rule of all inherent
righteousness.

. VII. If in the third place it be objected, that faith is a grace inherent
Object. 3. from faith.
but we are justified by faith. Or thus, faith does justify, faith is a grace
inherent, therefore some grace inherent does justify. I answer again, by
distinction, that faith does not justify, as it is a grace or quality
inherent, or as it is a part of our inherent righteousness; but relatively, as
it is the instrument, as has been said before, to receive Christ who is our
righteousness: neither does faith properly, but the object thereof, which it
apprehends, justify. As it is the alms properly, which releeveth the poor
man, not the hand which receives it. For when we say that a man is justified
by faith without works, or by faith alone, our meaning is, that we are
justified by the righteousness of Christ alone, which is apprehended by faith
only, without respect of any righteousness inherent in us, or obedieuce
performed by us.

. VIII. Fourthly, the justifying and saving grace is expressed Gratia gratum
facien^ expresssed by other terms which signific favor.
many times by other words of like signification to the gracious favor of God,
which cannot be drawn to signify our charity, or any grace inherent in us. As
appears both by such synonyma, as are joined with it in the same places, as
grace and love, 2 Cor. 13. 14. Grace and mercy, 1 Timothy 1. 2. 2 Timothy 1. 2. Tit.
1. 4. 2 John 3. and also by parallelling other places, as where it is said,
Tit. 2. 11. When the grace of God appeared, the same is expressed thus, chap.
3. 4. When the kindness of God and his love toward man appeared. And where in
some places Romans 3. 24. Ephesians. 2. 8. Tic. 3. 7. 2 Timothy 1. 9. Tit. 3. 4. 5. 7.
it is said, that we are justified or saved by his grace, or according to his
grace: in others it is said, according to his (...), his good will and
pleasure, Ephesians. 1. 5. 9. Phil. 2. 13. according to his mercy, Tit. 3. in which
place these four words are used as Synonyma, signifying the same thing, (...),
kindness or bounty, (...), love of mankind, (...) mercy, (...) grace This grace
of God is notably expressed, Ephesians. 2. 4. 5. 7. 8. by diverse words of the like
signification. God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love wherewith he
loved us, has when we were dead in our sins quickened us together with
Christ (by grace you are saved) that in the ages to come he might show the
exceeding riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Jesus Christ:
for by grace ye are saved through faith, etc. here is the riches of his
mercy, the exceeding riches of his grace, his greatlove wherewith he loved
us, his bounty toward us in Christ, and all to set forth his saving grace. So
in the Old Testament, mercy and grace are used as words of the like
signification. Exo. 33. 19. I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious,
and I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy; which text the Apostle
renders thus, Romans 9. 15. I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I
will have compassion of whom I will have compassion. Exodus 34. 6. where the
Lord proclaiming his goodness or bounty before Moses as he had promised chap.
33. 19. expresses it in these terms. The Lord, the Lord God, merciful, and
gracious, slow to anger, abundant in chesed ve emeth, in bounty and truth
(which in the New Testament are translated grace and John 1. 14. 17
truth) keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, etc. So Psalm. 86. 15.
Thou O Lord art a God full of compassion and gracious, long suffering and
plenteous in mercy and truth. Likewise Psalm. 130. 8. 2 King. 13. 3. So also
Psalm. 145. 8, 9. the Lord is gracious and full of compassion, slow to anger,
and of great mercy, the Lord is good to all, and his mercies are over all his
works. And in like manner, Nehem. 9. 17. thou art a God of condonations, that
is ready to pardon, So Jon. 4. 2.
gracious and merciful, sl^w to anger, and of great bounty.

. IX. Fifthly, if justifying grace were inherent, there would be no The fifth
argument because it is opposed t^ works.
such opposition, as the Apostle makes in the question of justification,
between grace and works; as that if we be justified by the one, we cannot
be justified by the other: but they might as well stand together, as the first
justification of the Papists, which is habitual, consisting in the habits of
grace infused, with the second which is actual consisting in works, or rather
the one would infer the other: because we cannot be justified by the one, (I
speak of adulti) without the other: for if we be justified by inherent
righteousness, that righteousness must be total and perfect, and therefore
both habitual, and actual, and both must concur unto justification: for
neither without the other is perfect. Object. Yea, but the Apostle, when he
says, that faith does justify without works, he speaks of the first
ju^ification, unto which works do not concur: and when he opposes grace to
works; he means the works of the Law, done before faith, without grace, by
the power of nature. Answ. This is all that the Papists have to excuse
themselves, that they do not openly contradict the Apostle, who so often and
so peremptorily concludes, that we are justified by grace and not by works,
by faith without the works of the Law. But it is evident, that by the works
of the Law is meant, all that obedience and righteousness, that is prescribed
in the Law, which is the perfect rule of all inherent righteousness. And
therefore, when the works of the Law are rejected, all inherent righteousness
is excluded from justification. It is also manifest, that the holy Ghost
speaks generally Psalm. 143 2. Romans 3. 28. Gal. 2. 16.
of all men, whether in the state of nature, or in the state of grace; and of
all works, whether going before, or following after faith; insomuch that the
works which we have done in righteousness, Tit: 3. 5. are excluded; yea the
works of faithful Abraham are denied to have justified him before God. And
therefore those who have both faith and works are justified by faith without
works. But these objectiots I shall fully satisfy in their due Lib. 7. Arg 6
because charity is not the justifying grace.
place.

. X. Sixthly, whereas the Papists say, that justifying grace is the same with
charity, I argue thus:

Charity is the fulfilling of the Law in our own persons:

But we are not justified by our fulfilling of the Law in our own persons,
Gal. 2. 16. 3. 10, 11.

Therefore we are not justified by our charity, and consequently not by grace
inherent.

. XI. Seventhly, that the Apostle by grace in the articles of justification
Arg. 7. plain testimonies where grace signifies grace
and salvation understood the gracious favor of God in Christ and not inherent
grace, appears both by his assention, Romans 5. 20. that where sin abounded,
Gods grace did much more abound; and by his question, Romans 6. 1. shall we
continue in sin, that grace may abound? for it were a strange conceit, that
where sin abounds, inherent righteousness should abound so much the more.
And to these we may add those places which speak of going to the throne of
grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace, Heb. 4. 16. of the exceeding
riches of his grace in his kindness toward us through Jesus Christ, for by
grace we are saved, Ephesians. 2. 7. 8. of the grace of God, and the gift of grace
distinguished one from the other, Romans 5. 15. of those that believe by the
grace of God, Act. 18. 27. of commending men to the grace of God, Act. 14. 26.
15. 40. of the word of his grace, Act. 14. 3. 20. 32. of the Gospel of his
grace, Act. 20. 24. of the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, who being rich
became poor for us, 2 Cor. 8. 9. of our predestination to the praise of the
glory of his grace Ephesians. 1. 5, 6. of the election of grace, Romans 11. 5. of the
appearing of the grace of God which brings salvation, Tit. 2. 11. of Christ
his tasting of death for us by the grace of God, Heb. 2. 9. of the reward not
imputed of grace to him that works, Romans 4. 4. of turning the grace of God
into wantonness, Iud. 4. etc.

. XII. Lastly, so clear is this truth, which we deliver according Arg. 8. the
confession of Papists.
to the scriptures concerning justifying grace, that Albertus Pighius, De lib.
arbitr.
a famous divine among the Papists does confess, that what the Schoolmen
teach concerning justifying grace, that it is a quality in our souls infused
of God, and there remaining after the manner of an habit; and that it is the
same in substance with the habit of charity, etc. are mere devises of men,
having no warrant in the Scriptures. Thomas Aquinas also writing on Tit. 2. 11.
it is to be known, says he, that grace signifies mercy -- and mercy
always was in God: yet, in respect of men, in times past it lay hid -- but
when Christ the Son of God appeared grace appeared -- and it may be said that
in the Nativity of Christ grace appeared two ways: the former, because by the
greatest grace of God he was given unto us -- and upon this grace in the second
place followed the instruction of mankind -- whereupon he says, teachingus,
etc. Whereunto we may add, that those few places, which Bellarmine alleges
for inherent grace, are by some of their own writers understood of the
gracious favor of God, as we shall show in the particulars which now we are to
examine.

CHAP. III. Bellarmines allegation for grace inherent out of Romans 3. 24. proved
to make against himself.
. I.

But before I propound them, I am to advertise the Reader, The calumniation of
the Papists, that we deny inherent graces, and in herent justice.
that we do not deny, that there are diverse graces of sanctification, and those
also necessary to salvation, as faith, hope, charity, the fear of God, etc.
inherent in the souls of the faithful, as divine qualities, residing there
per modum habitus. So that Bellarmine in his book Lib. 1. cap. 3. and ^.
de gratia and lib. arbitr. might well have spared his labor, whereby he
endeavoreth to prove such grace or graces to be inherent in the soul; which
never any of us denied. But we deny that gratia gratum faciens, or justifying
grace is inherent in us. This therefore Bellarmine labors to prove, lib. 2.
de justif. cap. 3.. Alterum. His allegation of Romans 3. 24.
unto which in the other place he does refer us: alleging Romans 3. 24. Being
justified freely by his grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus,
etc. Answ. It cannot be denied, but that the popish cause, in this particular,
is very desperate, when for the defense thereof they are able to allege one
only place, where grace is mentioned; and that such a one, as is a most
pregnant testimony to prove free justification by faith only, without respect
of any righteousness or grace inherent in us. The place Rom 3. 24 makes
wholly against the Papists.


. II. And this is proved, first, by the context, or coherence of these words,
with those which go before. For thus the Apostle reasons:

Those that be in themselves sinners, and by their sin obnoxious to the
judgment of God, are not justified by righteousness inherent, all which is
prescribed in the Law; but of necessity must be justified by a righteousness,
which without the Law is revealed in the Gospel, even the righteousness of
God, that is, of Christ, who is God, apprehended by faith.

But all men, without exception, both Jews and Gentiles are in themselves
sinners, and by their sin obnoxious to the judgment of God.

Therefore, seeing all have sinned, and are fallen short of the glory of God,
that is, excluded from eternal glory, they are not justified by righteousness
inherent which is prescribed in the Law; but they are justified by a
righteousness, which without the Law is revealed in the Gospel, to wit, the
righteousness of God, that is, of Christ, who is God, apprehended by faith.
And that is it which is said in this text, that those who have sinned, and are
fallen short of Gods glory, and from their title to heaven, are justified, that
is, acquitted from their sins, and entitled unto the Kingdom of heaven,
freely, without respect of any grace or righteousness in themselves, by the
mere gracious favor of God, when they had deserved the contrary, through the
redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God has set forth to be a
propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteousness, etc.

To the same purpose the Apostle disputes, Gal. 3. as hereafter we shall
hear.

III. Secondly, it is proved by the words of the text alleged: the Secondly,
it is proved by the words o^ the text.
first whereof is (...), being justified. Now the word (...), as I have proved
heretofore, does never in all the Scriptures signify to make righteous by
infusion of righteousness, and therefore here it is not meant, that we are
justified by grace infused. Neither does justification import a real or
positive change in the subject, but relative and (...), as has been showed.
And we must remember, that as it is called, so it is justificatio impii Romans
4. 5.
, the justification of a sinner; not only because before justification men are
sinners, but also because being justified, they still remain sinners in
themselves, though in Christ 2 Cor. 5. 21.
they are made righteous. And we are to conceive of justification as a
continued act of God from our vocation Romans 8. 30.
to our glorification, whereby he does accept of a believing sinner, as
righteous in Christ, not only at his first conversion, but also afterward,
whiles he believes in Christ: though still in himself he be a sinner. And
to that end does our Savior make continual intercession for us, that the
merit of his obedience may be^ continually imputed unto us.

As for the Papists, they being in their own conceit justified, as they all
are after they have been either baptized in their infancy, or absolved when
they come to years; they are no sinners, neither is there any thing in them
Council. Trid. s^ss. 5. de pec^at. orig. In renatis nihil odit Deus.
which God hates, or which may properly be called sin. But justification
being of sinners, and they being no sinners, but ^aying they have no sin, and
avouching, that he only is a just man in whom there is no sin; hereby it
appears, that neither are they justified, neither is there any 1 Ioh. 1. 8.

truth in them.

IV. The next word is (...), which is an exclusive particle, excluding the
false causes of justification, and signifying, that we are justified without
any desert or worthiness in our selves, without works, without respect of any
righteousness inherent in us: which directly overthrows the assertion of the
Papists, for proof whereof this place was alleged.

V. The third word is (...), by his grace: that is, by the gracious The third,
word, by his grace.
favor of God in Christ, which is out of us in him, as has been proved, that
is, by his love of us, and not by our love of him. Neither is there any show of
reason, why it should in this place, above all others signify as it never
does, an habit of justifying grace inherent in us: especially, if that be
true, which hereafter I shall plainly demonstrate, that we are not justified
by that which is inherent. And thus Saint Ambrose expounds these words,
gratia Dei gratis; justificati sunt gratis, quia nihil operantes, neque vicem
reddentes, sola fide justificati sunt, dono Dei: they are justified freely,
because neither working (before their justification) nor rendering any
recompense (after their justification) they are by faith only justified by the
grace, that is, (as he expounds it) the gift of God. And on those words by

(says he) that the grace of God is in Christ, (but not in us) because by the
will of God we were redeemed by Christ. Pererius likewise a learned Jesuit, The
name of Grace, says he, Perer* in Romans 3. Disput. 15.
when it is here said, justified freely by his grace, though it may signify,
that supernatural and divine quality infused into the soul of man, and
inherent therein: yet rather it seems in this place to signify gratuitam Dei
b^nitatem and benignitatem erga hominem, the free or gracious goodness and
bounty of God toward man. Grace therefore does not signify, either the
matter, or the form, but the efficient cause of our justification.

fourth word, through the redemption that is in Christ.
whereby is meant Christ's whole satisfaction made to the Law, both in respect
of the precept, and of the penalty; by which, being as the Papists themselves
confess, imputed unto us, we are redeemed and justified, as being the matter
and merit of justification.

word, by says.
by which we apprehend and receive that satisfaction or righteousness of
Christ, by which we are justified; which is indeed out of us in him, but
imputed to those that believe. The righteousness therefore, by which we are
justified, is the righteousness of faith, that is, the righteousness of God,
or of Christ apprehended by faith.

to be a propitiation for our sins; to show forth his righteousness for the
remission of sins, and that he might be just, and the justifier of him,
which believes in Jesus. For in the work of our redemption and justification
Gods justice is declared to be such, that he forgiveth no sins, but those
only, for which his justice is satisfied by Christ: neither does he justify
any, but those, whom by communication of Christ's righteousness unto them, he
makes just. But how should the satisfaction of Christ, that is, his obedience
and sufferings being transient, and so long ago performed, be communicated
unto us for our justification, otherwise but by imputation? And if we be
justified by imputation of Christ's righteousness, then not by inherent grace,
or infused righteousness.

CAP. IV. Bellarmines dispute out of Romans 3. 24. refuted.
. I.

NOw let us see what Bellarmine infers upon this Bellarmines dispute out of
Romans 3. 24. De Iusti^. lib. 2. cap.. Alterum.
place. Here (says he) all the causes almost of justification are set forth
together. The efficient cause is noted in the word gratis, freely, importing
the liberality of God: the formal cause, in the word Grace: the meritorious
cause, in the word redemption: the disposing cause, in the word faith: all of
them almost depraved or misapplyed by Bellarmine. For neither is the true
efficient cause (...), (which he calls, vocabulo nimis diluto, Gods
liberality) signified by the word gratis; but the false (...), or meritorious
cause is by this word excluded, and the true (...)* which is the merit of
Christ, included in the word redemption. As if he had said, we are justified
grat^s in respect of us, that is, without any cause or desert in us, without
any worthiness of ours: but not gratis in respect of Christ, by whose precious
death and merits we are justified. Neither by Grace is meant justice given and
infused of God, which, he says, is the formal cause of justification: but
the grace of God, as I have showed, signifies the gracious favor of God;
which is not the formal cause of justification, but the (...) the efficient or
moving cause. Neither is redemption, passively understood, the meritorious
cause of our justification: for that, as well as reconciliation or
justification it self, is the (...), the fruit and effect of Christ his death
and obedience: which, as they are the matter and meritorious cause of our
justification, so also the price and merit of our redemption. How then are we
said to be justified through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus? either by
a metonymy of the effect for the cause, redemption being put for Christ's
satisfaction, or paying of a price of ransom for us, by which we were
redeemed: or else we are said to be justified by his redemption, as we may be
said to be justified by remission of sins. For by Christ we have redemption,
that is, remission of sins, Col. 1. 7. Ephesians. 1. 14. and so Occumenius
expounds these words by the redemption, etc. (...). But how is he justified?
by the forgiveness of sins which we obtain in Christ Jesus. Neither is
faith the disposing cause, as he says, (for then a man might have a true,
lively, justifying faith, and not be actually justified, which is contrary to
the Scriptures, Act. 13. 39. Ioh. 5. 24. 6. 47. but the isntrumental cause:
which is therefore said to justify, because the object, which it receives,
does justify: in which sense the same benefits which we receive from Christ,
are ascribed to faith. Now the object of faith being the righteousness of
Christ, which is out of us in him; it is evident, that when we are said to be
justified by faith, it is meant, that we are not justified by righteousness
inherent, but by that righteousness which faith does apprehend.

. II. Yea, but Bellarmine will prove by diverse arguments, that Bellarmines
proof that grace Romans 3. 24. does not signify the favor of God. First, from
the word gratis.
Grace in this place does not signify the gracious favor of God: first,
because the favor of God was sufficiently signified by the word gratis. For
he that justifies freely does it out of good will and liberality: therefore
that addition, by grace, does not signify the favor it self, but some thing
else, that is to say, the effect of that favor. I answer, that the Greek
word (...) and the Hebrew Chinnam, is a particle exclusive of any cause, price,
worth or desert in us, which may be showed by many examples. Where it
signifies, first, without cause or desert: As where it is said, they hated me
(...), that is, without any cause in me or desert of mine, Ioh. 15. 25. ex
Psalm. 35. 19. and verse. 7. where Symmachus reads (...), Psalm. 69. 4. So
Ezech. 14. 23. 1 Samuel 19. 5. 25. 31. 1 King. 2. 32. Psalm. 109. 3. 119. 161.
Lam. 3. 52. Secondly, freely, without paying any price, as Exodus 21. 11. Numb.
11. 5. 2 Samuel 24. 24. Esai. 52. 3. 5. Mat. 10. 8. Apoc. 21. 6. 22. 17. So that
this exclusive particle was inserted, not to set down the true cause of
justification, but to exclude the false: that we are justified freely without
any cause in us, or desert of ours, or price paid by us, merely by the grace
of God, through the redemption which is in Jesus Christ. And thus is the word
expounded by all Writers almost, both Old and New, and those as well Papists as
Protestants. In Romans 3.
Ambrose, as you heard, gratis, says he, quia nihil operantes, nec vicem
reddentes sola fide justificati sunt dono Dei: freely, because working nothing,
nor making any recompense, they are justified through faith alone, by the gift
of God. De verbis Apostoli. Sermon. 15.
Augustine, Prorsus gratis das, gratis salvas, qui nihil invenis unde salves,
and multum invenis unde damnes: Altogether freely thou give, and freely thou
savest, because thou find nothing for which thou should save, and thou
find much for which thou may condemn. In Romans 3.
Oecumenius, (...), freely, that is, without any good deeds of thine thou art
saved: and (...).
again, as bringing nothing else but faith, and after, because all have
sinned, therefore all that believe in Christ are justified freely, (...).
bringing only faith to their justification. Hugo Cardinalis; glossa interlin.
gratis, i. sine meritis. So Thomas Aguinas, and other Popish Writers; yea,
Justificari gratis, est justificari sine merito, sine operibus. De Iustif. lib.
1. cap. 21. His second reason from the preposition per.
Bellarmine himself, to be justified freely is to be justified without
merit, without works. This particle therefore shows not by, or for what we
are justified: but by or for what we are not justified.

III. His second reason: because the preposition per, when it is said, per
gratiam, being not a note, as he says, of the efficient cause, is not rightly
applied to the favor or good will of God, which is the efficient cause, but
either to the formal cause, or to the meritorious cause, or to the instrument.
For we could not well say, that God does justify us per favorem aut per suam
benevolentiam, by his favor or by his good will: but we say well by grace
inherent (though not very well by his grace inherent, for that which is
inherent is ours, though from him) by the merit of his son, by faith, by the
sacraments.

First, I answer, that the preposition is not in the original text, where the
Apostle does not say, (...), as noting in Bellarmines conceit the formal
cause, but (...), as noting the antecedent or moving cause, which is principium
actionis, as is usual in the like actions, which (the efficients working per
se) are done natura, art, consilio or voluntate, etc. in which we do not
say, per naturam, per artem, etc. And therefore this objection is very
frivolous. Secondly, I answer, that per in Latin, and (...) in Greek, are
very often applied to the efficient cause: whereof, even in the New Testament,
there are, as I suppose, more examples than there be leaves: whereof some are
attributed to God, as Romans 11. 36. Gal. 1. 1. Heb. 7. 21. to the Son, Ioh. 1.
3. Col. 1. 16. Heb. 1. 6, etc. to the holy Ghost, Romans 5. 5. 1 Cor. 12. 8, 9.
And to omit other examples, which are innumerable, to the attributes of God,
which are the prime motive causes of all his actions: as by the will of God, 1
Cor. 1. 1. Ephesians. 1. 1. Col. 1. 1. Romans 5. 32. 2 Cor. 8. 5. by the grace of Jesus
Christ we shall be saved, Act. 15. 11. who believed by Grace, Act. 18. 27.
called by his grace, Galath. 1. 15. by the tender mercies of our God, Luke 1.
78.

Thirdly, to Bellarmine in this De justif. l. 2. cap. 3.
place denying the preposition per to be rightly applied to the efficient
cause, I oppose Bellarmine C. 12.. Respondeo illud: Particulam a. per
significare causam efficientem perspicuum est. His third reason not proving the
point.
in the twelfth chapter of the same book, affirming, that the particle per
does signify the cause efficient, as Pro. 8. per me Reges regnant, etc.

His third argument. The good will of God cannot be in vain, but always
performs and works that good, which he wills to any. For whatsoever he
wills that he does, Psalm. 115. 3, etc. Answ. All this is true in respect of
his will decreeing any thing, which is absolute, Esa. 46. 10.
and is called voluntas beneplaciti; but not in respect of his will prescribing
or requiring any thing, which is conditional, and is called voluntas signi: of
which will the Apostle speaks in the place cited by Bellarmine, 1 Th. 4. 3.
This is the will of God even your sanctification. Otherwise, by Bellarmines
argument all men should be holy, because, as he says, God would have them
truly just and holy. Therefore, says he, if justifying grace be the favor and
goodwill of God, and God does not favor nor wish well in vain, but makes us
holy, and blameless, such as he would have us to be, then it follows, that
to be justified by grace, is not only to be reputed just, and not to be so,
but to be truly just, holy, and blameless. Answ. This argument does not prove
the particular point, for which it is brought, namely, that by grace is meant
grace inherent, and not the gracious favor of God. But if it were ought worth,
it would serve to prove the maine question: that although grace did signify
the favor of God, when it is said, that we are justified by his grace: yet
this place would prove, that we are also made just by grace inherent. For whom
the Lord favors and wishes well unto, his benevolence is not in vain to
him: but to whom he wills good he works it, making them truly just and
holy, whom by his grace he justifies. For he has elected us that we might
be holy, Ephesians. 1. 4. and this is his will, our ^anctification. All this we
freely confess, that whom God justifies, he makes just; first, by
imputation, and truly and perfectly, as he justifies: secondly, by infusion,
as he sanctifies. But the Papists must at length learn to distinguish
betwixt justification and sanctification. For as we have said before, we are
justified by grace, as it signifies the gracious favor of God only: but we
are sanctified not only by his gracious favor as the efficient, but also by
his graces infused and inherent in us, as the matter. His fourth reason, from
the attributes given to Grace.


. V. His fourth argument consists of six slender proofs put together, which
are scarce worth the answering. That justifying grace, ^aith he, is not only
the favor of God, but a gift inherent in the soul, it may be understood by
the diverse attributes and names thereof. As first, that it is called a gift, a
gift which we receive, a gift given by Christ, a gift given by measure.
Secondly, that it is compared to essence. Thirdly, that it is compared to
light. The first be cause it is a gift


To the first, I answer, that the gracious love and favor of God is said in
the scriptures to be given, that is vouchsafed unto us, even the grace whereby
we were elected and predestined to the adoption of children, according to
the good pleasure of his will, by which we are called, justified, and saved, 2 Timothy 1. 9. God has saved and called us with an holy calling, not according to
our works, but according to his own purpose and grace, which (grace) was (...)
given us in Christ Jesus before secular times, having thereby graciously
accepted us in his beloved, Ephesians. 1. 6. Behold, says 1 Ioh. 3. 1.
Saint John, how great love the Father has (...)
given us, that we should be called the children of God, 1 Ioh. 3. 1. For to
so many as received Christ, he gave (...)
power to be the sons of God, even to them that believe in his name, Ioh. 1.
12.

. VI. Yea, but it is such a gift as we do receive. Very like: for giving
Secondly, a gift which we receive.
and receiving are relatives; and therefore what God gives us we do receive,
namely as he gives it: but he does not give all things by infusion, and
therefore hereof it does not follow, that what we receive in inherent, but that
only, which he gives by way of infusion. Now he has vouchsafed us his
grace, whereby he elected, redeemed, adopted, justified us, not by infusion,
but by acceptance in Christ, which grace we receive by the hand of faith, and
whom he has graciously accepted in his beloved, they are (...), made
partakers of that grace, which notwithstanding is in God, and not in them. But
let us consider his proof, Romans 5. 11. receiving the abundance of grace and of
the gift os righteousness. Answ. By grace here is meant gracious favor,
neither does the Apostle here say the gift of grace, but the abundance of grace
and of the gift of righteousness. For where these two are joined together,
grace and gift, grace signifies gracious favor: the gift of grace the fruit
and effect of that favor, being some benefit bestowed, whether real or
relative. The former is (...) the grace of God, the latter is properly (...).
And this is prooved out of the 15. verse, where is mention both of the grace of
God, and of the gift by grace: and that which is here called the abundance of
grace, and verse. 15. the abounding grace, is elsewhere called the superabundant
riches of his grace, Ephesians. 2. 7. that is, of his gracious favor: which in the
same Chapter to the Romans, verse. 20. is said to have superabounded, where
sin did abound: which, without great absurdity, cannot be understood of
grace inherent. Neither is the gift of grace, or of righteousness here
mentioned, inherent: but this (...), which came upon us to justification, is
opposed to (...) guilt, which came upon all men (...), unto condemnation; that
is to say, the merit of Christ's obedience, opposed to the guilt of Adams fall*
as the whole context does prove. But as we were made sinners by Adams fall,
the guilt thereof being imputed unto us: so we are made righteous by Christ's
obedience, the merit thereof being imputed unto us.

. VII. Yea, but it is a gift given by Christ. It is very true, for in and by
Thirdly, a gift given by Christ.
Christ all grace and favor is vouchsafed unto us: for in him he has
graciously accepted Ephesians. 1. 6.
us. And therefore, as it is called the grace of God, so in many places it is
called the grace of Christ; not only because in and by him it is granted to
us, but also, because he does bestow it. But does it hereof follow, that this
grace is inherent? what spiritual favor or grace tending to salvation has
God vouchsafed unto us, otherwise than in and by Christ? In him he vouchsafed
us grace Ephesians. 1. 3. 6.
in general, and in particular the grace of election: for in him we were
chosen, Ephesians. 1. 4. The grace of vocation, and salvation given us in Christ. 2 Timothy 1. 9. the grace of adoption, (...), by Jesus Christ, Ephesians. 1. 5. The
grace of reconciliation in and by Christ, Romans 5. 1. 11. 2 Cor. 5. 19. Col. 1.
20. The grace of redemption by Christ, Romans 3. 24. Ephesians. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14. The
grace of justification by Christ, Romans 5. 9. 17, 18, 19. And how is this
proved, which no man doubts of, that grace is given by Christ? because it is
said, Ioh. 1. 17. Gratia and veritas per Iesum Christum facta est, grace and
verity was made by Jesus Christ, where, leaving his hold, that it is given; he
urges, as if he had forgot himself, the phrase, facta est, is made; for,
says he, it is not well said that the favor and benevolence of God is made.

. VIII. Answ. The word in the Original is (...), which does Made by Christ.
not always signify was made, but many times is expressed by the Verb
substantive fuit, or extitit, as Mark. 1. 4. (...), Matthew. 11. 26. 26. 6. John
1. 6. sometimes by the Verb became, as Ioh. 1. 14. (...), the word became
flesh, so Mark. 1. 17. 1 Cor. 9. 20. 13. 1. and sometimes by the Verb came,
and that in the sense either of happening, Romans 11. 25. 2 Timothy 3. 11. or of
growing, Matthew. 21. 19. 1 Timothy 6. 4. or of being present, Ioh. 6* 21. 25. Act.
21. 17. 35. 27. 7. Now the sense of the word varying, it is to be fitted to the
place, wherein it is used, but the sense, that grace and truth was made by
Christ, fitteth not. But either we are to say, extitit, it was by Christ, as
Valla and sometimes Beza translated (...), or that it came by him, as our
translation reads, or that it was exhibited Beza, pr^stita est.
or given by Christ, as the law both moral (showing sin and denouncing the
curse) opposed to grace, and also ceremonial (consisting of shadows and
types) opposed to truth, was (...).
given by Moses. And thus Bellarmine himself understood this place: for to
prove, that grace was given by Christ, he alleged this text. But though grace
and truth were given by Christ, does it follow, that therefore grace does
signify grace inherent? or if it did, that, that inherent grace is justifying
grace? Howbeit the true meaning of the word, is either according to the proper
signification, which is most usual, especially when these two Chased and
Emeth, grace and truth go together: or because grace and truth given by Christ
are opposed to the Law given by Moses; by grace and truth we may understand
the doctrine of grace and truth. For as the doctrine of grace, that is to say,
the Gospel (which is the word of grace Act. 20. 24 32.
and the Gospel of Gods grace) especially, when it is opposed to the Law, is
termed grace, Romans 6. 14, 15. Gal. 5. 4. Ephesians. 3. 2. 1 Pet. 5. 12. so also the
doctrine of salvation by Christ, which is the word of truth, Ephesians. 1. 13. 2 Timothy 2. 15. Iam. 1. 18. the truth of the Gospel, Gal. 2. 5. 14. or the word of
the truth of the Gospel, Col. 1. 5. is oftentimes called the truth, John 5.
33. and in many other places, as hereafter Lib. 6. c. 6.. 2.
shall be showed.

. IX. Fourthly, he alleges that this grace is given by measure from Fourthly,
a gift g^ven by measure from Christ.
Christ himself, Ephesians. 4. 7. To every one of us grace is given according to
the measure of the donation of Christ. But the favor of God, says he, is not
given by measure, nor by Christ. Answ. This place is not understood of
justifying grace, which is the gracious favor of God in Christ, which is out
of us in him; but of the several gifts of grace in us, which by a Metonymy are
called graces, but properly (...), (as Oecumenius upon that place has well
observed, (...), to every one is given grace, that is, a gift of grace) whether
they be the graces of sanctification, which are the proper fruits of saving
grace, or those which by the Schoolmen are called gratiae gratis datae, of
which the Apostle seems to speak in that place; as he explaineth himself
in the verses following, verse. 8. 11, 12. In which sense the Apostle Peter
uses the words (...) and (...), 1 Pet. 4. 10. As every one has received
(...), a gift of grace, even so minister the same one to another, as good
stewards of the manifold grace of God. Of these gifts of grace it is true,
which Bellarmine says, that they are given Ephesians. 4 8.
by Christ, and that they are given by measure. But will he from thence prove,
that what grace is either given by Christ, or in measure, is not Gods favor? I
had thought, that the saving grace of God, according to his last allegation out
of Ioh. 1. 17. had been given by Christ, and that it is from the Father,
through the Son, by the Holy Ghost. And therefore as it is called the grace
of Tit. 2. 11.
God, who is the God of all grace, 1 Pet. 5. 10. so also the grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ 2 Cor. 13. 14.
, and the grace of the holy Spirit who is the Spirit of grace. Heb. 10. 29. And
I had also thought, that the favor of God (though not that which justifies)
is in diverse degrees vouchsafed unto his creatures. God loves and favors
Sap. 11. 24.
all his creatures, he is good to all, and his mercies a^ over all his works,
Psalm. 145. 9. giving all things to all, Act. 17. 25. yet among the bodily
creatures he respects and favors men chiefly, 1 Cor. 9. 9. Psalm. 8. 4.
Mat. 6. 26. 30. Prove. 8. 31. for which cause Tit. 3. 4.
(...) (love of mankind) is attributed to him. Among men he favors the
faithful more than the rest, 1 Timothy 4. 10. who are therefore called the
favorites of God, as I have showed before. Among them the Lord especially
favors Ministers and Magistrates, Psalm. 105. 15. who are also called the
favorites of God, not only in respect of justifying grace (which is ^quall in
all to whom it is vouchsafed) but also in respect of their functions, and the
gifts of grace bestowed on them for the good of others, De^t. 33. 8. 2 Chronicles.
6. 41. Psalm. 4 4. 132. 6. 16. To which purpose (...) Aug. t. 9. in Joan. Omnia
dilig^ Deus quae feci^: and inter ea magis diligit creatures ratione; and de
illis eas amplius, qua sunt membra unlgenitum sui, and multo magis ipsum
anigenit^m suum. 5. Grace compared to essence.
says well, God loves all things which he has made; and among them he loves
more the reasonable creatures; and among them he loves more amply those, who
are the members of his only begotten Son; and much more his only begotten
himself, the son of his love. And generally, by how much the better any man
is than others, it is an evidence, that he is so much graced and favored of
God: the grace and favor of God being the cause of their goodness, and
consequently the greater favor of greater goodness.

. X. Fifthly, it is, says he, compared to essence, which is given by creation,
hence it is, that we are said to be created in Christ, Ephesians. 2. 10. and to be a
new creature, Gal. 6. 15. But that, by which we are called creatures, is inward
and inherent in us. Answ. That, whereby we are created anew according to the
image of God in true holiness and righteousness, is the grace, not of
justification (for we are created to good works, which in the same place are
opposed to grace and are excluded from justification) ^ Ephesians. 2. 8. 9.
but of regeneration and sanctification, which we acknowledge to be inwardly
wrought by the holy Spirit in those that are justified by the gracious favor
of God through faith. But who would think, that the Papists were so blinded
with malice, as either to persuade themselves, or to go about to persuade
others, that we deny the graces of sanctification to be inherent, and
affirm, that we are sanctified by such a righteousness or holiness, as is
without us. 6. Grace compared to light.


. XI. Finally, says he, it is compared to light, 2 Cor. 6. 14. What followship
has light with darkness? Ephesians. 5. 8. Ye were sometimes darkness, but now
you are light in the Lord. 1 Ioh. 2. 9. He that says, that he is in the
light, and hates his brother, is in darkness. But light does not make a body
lucidum, unless it be inherent: neither does it suffer darkness with it. How
then (...), a justified man be said not only to be ^ucidus lightsome, but
also light in the Lord, whereas before he was dark, if still the darkness of
sin be inherent i^ him, and the light of grace abide without. Answ. We are
called light in the abstract by a metonymie; either because we are in the light
(which is not inherent in us, being either God, or the favor of God, which is
the state of grace) or because of that light which is in us: which is the grace
not of justification, but of regeneration; and is compared to light, both in
respect of the inward illumination of the soul, and also of the external
sanctification of the life shining forth to others, of which our Savior
speaks, Mat. 5. 16. Let your light, viz. of your godly conversation, so shine
before men, that they seeing your good works may glorify your Father that is
in heaven. But where he says, there can be no darkness in him that is light,
it is as much as if he should say, that there can be no sin in him that is
sanctified. But he should remember, that God alone is light in whom there is no
darkness, 1 Ioh. 1. 5. and that in the best of us there is darkness, that
is, the flesh, even a body of sin and of death, as well as light, that is, the
Spirit, Gal. 5. 17. Romans 7. 14, 17, 20, 23, 24, 25. and that he who says, he
has no sin (which is the case of all justified, yea of all baptized, and of
all absolved and absolute Papists) he is a Iyar, and there is no truth in him.
1 Ioh. 1. 8. And this was his fourth argument containing six petite proofs.

CHAP. V. His fifth argument from Romans 5. 5. answered. De justif. l. 2. c. 3.
Preterea gratiam.

. I.

His fifth proof from Romans 5. 5.
FOr having no more places where grace is named to prove justifying grace to
be inherent, he flies to Romans 5. 5. where not grace but the love of God is
mentioned. That grace, says he, whereby the Apostle says we are justified, is
said also to be charity diffused in our hearts by the holy Ghost, which is
given unto us. The words are, because the love of God, or Gods love, is effused
or powered forth, etc. But here now the question is, first, whether by the love
of God in this place is meant the love, whereby God loves us: or that love
whereby we love God. And secondly, if that love of God whereby we love him
should be meant, how is it proved, that that love of ours is Gods justifying
grace? For this latter, though we constantly deny it, Bellarmine goes not
about to prove, but takes for granted, it being the maine point in question,
which cannot be proved out of this, or any other place. As touching the former,
our Divines do hold, that by Gods love in this place is meant that love,
whereby God loves us, and not that whereby we love God: The Papists hold the
contrary, which Bellarmine endeavoreth to prove by the testimony of De Spiritu
and litera. c. 32.
Augustine and two weak proofs out of Romans 8. August. testimony that here
that love is meant, whereby we love God, opposed by many testimonies.


. II. The testimony of Augustine he urges very sophistically, as if we had
no better proof to oppose to the testimony of Saint Augustine, than the
authority of our own writers: or as if we might not differ from Augustine in
expounding some place of Scriptures, unless we will prefer our selves before
him, when notwithstanding the Popish writers in expounding the Scriptures
differ from Augustine, as often as we. But to the Testimony of Augustine, who
says, that the love, which is said to be shed in our hearts, is not that love
whereby God loves us, but that whereby we love God; we oppose first, the
authority of those Writers, who understand this place of the love of God, both
actively wherewith he loves us (which is the same with his saving grace) and
also passively, whereby he is loved of us, (which is a notable fruit of his
saving grace) or of either of them both indifferently: as Orig^n, Sedulius,
Haymo, Anselmus, Remigius, Bruno, Thomas Aquinas, Dominicus a Soto, Pererius
Disput. 2. in Romans 5. Cornelius a Lapide: Secondly, the authority of those, who
understand this love to be that, wherewith God loves us. As of In locum.
Ambrose, who says, we have the pledge of Gods love in us by the holy Ghost
given unto us -- for that the promise is faithful, the holy Ghost given to the
Apostles, and to us, does prove, and does confirm our hope, and that he might
commend the love of God in us, that because it is impossible that those who are
beloved should be deceived, he might make us secure concerning the promise,
because both it is God who has promised, and they are dear to him to whom he
has promised. Of In locum.
Chrysostom, who says, (...) whom Theophylact follows, from that love which
God sherved toward us. Of Oecumenius (...), out of the love of God alone
wherewith he loved us: of Hierom^ and likewise of Primatius, Quomodo nos Deus
diligat ex hoc cognoscinous, how God does love us hereby we know. To these,
from among the Popish Writers we may add Cardinal In locum: solidum spei
fundamentum ex Dilectione Dei erga nos manifestat.
Cajetan, who says, the Apostle manifests the solid foundation of hope from
the love of God toward us: and again, Vnde patet, quod primum f^ndamentum
spei explicat dilectionem Dei erga nos.
whereby it appears that he sets forth the love of God toward us, as the
chief foundation of hope. Cardinal Tolet, charitatem Dei appellat qua diligit
nos Deus, he calls it the love of God wherewith he loves us. ^lucid. in.
Romans 5. 5.
Arias Montanus, that our hope is rooted in that love wherewith God has loved
us. B. In locum. Reasons proving that Gods love to us Is meant. First, from the
words of the Text.
Iustitian, who expounds the words thus, because that divine charity
wherewith God embraced us is shed into our hearts.

. III. Thirdly, we oppose evident reasons from the whole context, that is, not
only from the words of the text it self, but also from those, which either
go before, or follow after. For, first touching the words of the Text: By the
holy Spirit is meant the Spirit of Adoption, as Bellarmine confesses in his
next proof, viz. that the Apostle speaking, Romans 8. 15. de hoc ipso Spiritu,
of this self same Spirit, says, you have received the Spirit of Adoption; who
is then said to shed abroad Gods love in our hearts, when he does persuade our
souls of Gods love toward us in Christ, testifying with our Spirits that we
are the sons of God, Romans 8. 15, 16. Gal. 4. 6.
and making us to cry in our hearts Abba Father, with whom being the Spirit of
promise, Ephesians. 1. 13, 14. 4. 30. 2 Cor. 1, 21. 5 5.
and the earnest of our inheritance, so many as believe are sealed unto the day
of our ^ull redemption. Thus by sealing unto our souls the assurance of Gods
love, he is said to shed abroad the love of God in our hearts: Secondly, that
love of God which he sheddeth abroad in our hearts and seals unto us, as the
ground whereupon our sound hope, which never makes ashamed, is founded, is
Gods eternal and immutable love; from the assurance whereof sealed unto us by
the Holy Ghost our assured hope does flow. And therefore if we speak, as the
Apostle here does, of such a love of God, as is both the Object of our faith,
and the ground of our hope: we must say with Saint 1 Ioh. 4. 10.
John, herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and sent
his Son to be the propitiation for our sins. For that is it, whereby
especially God has commended this his love toward us, as it is here said,
verse. 8. and as Saint John also says in the same place, 1 Ioh. 4. 9. In this
was manifested the love of God toward us, because God sent his only begotten
Son into the world, that we might live through him. As for us, we love God,
because he loved us first, 1 Ioh. 4. 19. For when we are by the holy Ghost
shedding abroad the love of God in our hearts persuaded of Gods love toward us
in Christ; then, and never till then our hearts are inflamed to love God
again, and our neighbor for Gods sake. But why is this love of God said to be
shed forth in our hearts? (for this some do urge.) I answer, either in
respect of the knowledge and assurance thereof wrought in us by the holy Ghost,
as I have said (for therefore the holy Ghost is given unto us, that we might
know 1 Cor. 2 1^.
(...), the things freely given or vouchsafed unto us of God, among which the
principal is his love:) or as those of the Church of Rome, who consent with us
in this point, do speak; it is said to be effused, either as the cause is said
to be effused by the effects, which are the gifts proceeding from Gods love,
the chief whereof is the Spirit, which is given unto us, even the Spirit of
adoption, which as Chrysostom says upon this place, is (...), the greatest
gift: or as the bounty of a Prince is shed abroad by his Almoner distributing
the princes goods: for even so the love and gracious bounty of God is shed
abroad in our hearts by the Spirit of grace the dispenser of Gods gifts unto
us, 1 Cor. 12. 11.

. IV. In the words going before the Apostle sets down the Secondly, out of
the words precedent.
fruits of justification by faith; first, that being justified by faith we have
peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ; secondly, by him we have through
faith access into this grace wherein we stand, or as the Apostle speaks,
Ephesians. 3. 12. by him we have boldness and access with confidence through
faith in him; thirdly, joy in the holy Ghost, rejoicing in hope of the glory of
God. And in these three the kingdom of grace consists, viz. in
righteousness, peace, and joy in the holy Ghost, Romans 14. 17. And this joy the
Apostle amplifieth, because we glory and rejoice in hope of glory, not only
when all things go with us according to our minds, but also in affliction and
tribulation. Knowing that affliction being sanctified to them who have peace
with God, works patience, and patience works probation ((...)) that is, as
Chrysostom very well expounds it, (...), it makes him approved who is
tried: for by patient bearing of afflictions, which are (...), trials, a man is
by experience found to be (...), that is, a sound and upright Christian, as
Saint James Iam. ^ 12.
says, and when he is so found, he shall receive the Crown of life. And
therefore has cause to hope, as Saint Paul here says, that probation works
hope, and the hope of him that is (...) makes not ashamed: whereas
contrariwise the hope of the hypocrite makes him ashamed, but what is the
ground of all this? how come we to have this peace, this confidence, this joy,
this undaunted hope? Can we have it by the bare assent of faith without
application or desire thereof, which is the only faith which the Papists
acknowledge? Can we have it by our own charity, when we cannot know, as the
Papists teach, that we have charity? Nothing less, but the ground and
foundation of all our peace and comfort is this, because the spirit of God,
teaching those that believe to apply the promises of the Gospel to themselves
(which cannot be done without special faith) the love of God is shed forth into
their hearts that is, by the Spirit of adoption sealing those that do believe,
they are persuaded, and in some measure assured of the eternal love of God
toward them in Christ, upon which do follow peace of conscience, access with
confidence and joy in the holy Ghost. I conclude with Chrysostom, Chrysostom. in
locum
(...), says he, the Apostle having said, that hope makes not ashamed, he
ascribes all this not to our good works, but to the love of God; not that
whereby we love him, for that is our chief (...) (good works) but that whereby
he loves us.

. V. Now let us come to the words which follow, which as Cornelius a Thirdly,
from the words that follow.
Lapide confesses, Valde favent, do very much favor our exposition: wherein
the Apostle shows, how this love of God, whereon our hope, etc. is grounded,
is both manifested and assured unto us. It is manifested by this, verse 6. that
when we were of no strength, yea dead in our sins, the Son of God dyed for
us: for so says the Apostle, Ephesians. 2. 4, 5. God who is rich in mercy, for his
great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in our sins, has
quickened us together with Christ, by whose grace we are saved: which
wonderfully sets forth the love of God toward us: for scarcely as it is
verse. 7. for a righteous man will one dye. And greater love no man has than
this, that a man lay down his life for his friend, Ioh. 15. 13. But God (says
the Apostle verse. 8.) commends his love toward us (even that love mentioned
verse 5.) in that, whiles we were yet sinners, and by our sins his enemies,
Christ dyed for us. It is assured, by an argument from the ^ Romans 5, 9, 10.
less to the greater. For if when we were sinners we were redeemed and
justified by the blood of Christ, much more being justified, we shall be saved
from wrath through him. For if when we were enemies we were reconciled to God
by the death of his Son, much more being reconciled we shall be saved by
his life. I conclude therefore, that notwithstanding the testimony of
Augustine, (which as himself Uid. diatrib. de Antiebristo part. 2 ad demonstr.
1.
confesses deserves no credit further than it is warranted by the authority
of Gods word, or sound reason) by the love of God in this place is meant Gods
love toward us. I come to his two other arguments. His former proof out of
Romans 8. 15.


. VI. The former, (which is a very weak one) is by paralleling that place with
Romans 8. 15. For, says he, the same Apostle speaking of the same spirit given
unto us, says, You have received the Spirit of adoption of sons, by which we
cry Abba Father. Now, says he, we cry Abba Father by that charity, whereby
we love God, not by that whereby he loves us. Which reason, if it be reduced
into a syllogism, will not conclude his assertion, but the erroneous opinion
of Lombard Lib. did. 17.
the master of sentences, which Bellarmine De grati^ and. lib. arb. l. 1. c. 8.
himself elsewhere confuteth, namely, that the charity whereby we love God,
is the holy Ghost.

That whereby we cry in our hearts Abba Father is the holy Ghost.

By that charity wherewith we love God we cry in our hearts Abba Father:

Therefore that Charity wherewith we love God is the holy Ghost.

This conclusion Bellarmine knows to be false. Therefore either the
proposition is false, or the assumption: for it is impossible, that a false
conclusion should be inferred from true premises in a formal syllogism, as
this is. But the proposition is the Apostles, both Romans 8. 15. and Gal. 4. 6.
therefore the assumption is false. Neither is charity that fruit of the holy
Ghost, whereby the Spirit of adoption causes us to cry Abba Father, but faith.
For although by charity we may be declared or known to be the sons of
God: yet we become the sons of God, not by charity, but by faith, Ioh. 1.
12. Gal. 3. 26. And consequently not by charity, but by faith wrought in us by
the Spirit of adoption, testifying with our Spirits that we are the sons of
God, the said spirit makes us to cry in our hearts, Abba Father.

. VII. His second proof is out of Romans 8. 10. where it is said, that His
second proof out of Romans 8. 10.
by justifying grace we do live. The body indeed is dead by reason of sin,
Spiritus autem vivit propter justificationem, as the vulgar Latin reads: but
the Spirit lives because of justification. But we cannot well be said to live
by the external favor of God, seeing nothing is more inward than life. Answ.
In this argument nothing is sound, for first it proves not the point for which
it is brought, viz. that by the love of God, Romans 5. 5. is meant our love of
God. Neither is it said, Romans 8. 10. that we live by justifying grace, for
neither is justifying grace mentioned, but (...), justice; neither is it said,
that we live by it, (though it be true that by justifying faith we live) but
that the Spirit is life propter justificationem, for or by reason of
righteousness. And further it is well said, that our Spirit lives the
spiritual and eternal life by the gracious favor of God, which is out of us
in him, by which we are saved: as also for and by reason of the righteousness
and merits of Christ, which also are out of us in him. Neither does it follow,
that because life is inward, that therefore it propter quod for which or by
reason whereof we do live, should also be inward.

. VIII. But to let pass his impertinent allegation of this place, The true
meaning of the place.
and to explain the true meaning thereof: which is to set down in this verse
and that which follows two privileges of those in whom Christ dwells by
his Spirit, the one in respect of the soul, verse. 10. that howsoever by reason
of sin the body is dead, that is, mortal or subject to death: yet the soul
is life, that is, designed unto life, by reason of righteousness. The other,
in respect of the body, verse. 11. that if Christ dwell in us by his Spirit;
then he which raised up Christ from the dead, shall also by the same Spirit
quicken, that is, raise up unto life eternal our mortal bodies. Now, as our
body is dead, that is, subject to death by reason of Adams sin, in whom, as
the root, all sinned: so our soul is life, or entitled to life, by reason of
Christ's righteousness; in whom, as our head, we satisfied the justice of God:
The sin of the first Adam, and the righteousness of the second, being both
communicated unto us by imputation. And this is all that Bellarmine has
alleged to prove that justifying grace is inherent: all which is as good as
nothing.

CAP. VI. The use of the word Grace in the writings of the Fathers.
. I. HAving showed how the word grace is used in the The word grace used most
frequently for the grace of sanctification, because that was oppugned by the
Pelagians.
Scriptures, something is to be added concerning the use thereof in the
writings of the Fathers, whose authority the Papists are wont to object against
us. Howbeit as in the Scriptures, so also in the Fathers, there are two
principal significations of the word Grace: the one, proper, signifying the
gracious favor of God in Christ, by which they acknowledge us to be elected,
called, justified and saved. The other, metonymicall, signifying the gift of
grace, and namely the grace of regeneration or sanctification, which in the
Scriptures is called the Spirit, opposed to the flesh, and the new Man, or new
creature, which is renewed, and as it were recreated according to the Image of
God in true holiness and righteousness.

Of this grace of sanctification there is more frequent mention in the Fathers,
who wrote against the Pelagians than of the other. Because the Pelagians
acknowledging the grace of God in forgiving sins, which is indeed the
justifying and saving grace: they had not the like occasion to insist upon the
declaration and proof thereof, as they had of the other, which the Pelagians
denied.

. II. Of whose errors in this point there were four degrees. Four degrees of
the error of the Pelagians.
For first, they acknowledge no other inward grace of God but bonum naturae,
the possibility of nature and the power of free will: which because it is
freely given of God without any precedent merits of ours, they acknowledged to
be Gods grace. In the second place they acknowledged the grace, that is, the
gracious favor of God in forgiving sins: but the inward virtue, avoid sins
and to walk in obedience, they ascribed to the power of nature. Thirdly, for
our direction and instruction, how and what sins to avoid, and how and what
duties to perform; they acknowledged Gods grace in teaching and instructing us
by his word and by his law. Fourthly, they acknowledged, after a sort, the
help of grace for the more easy performance of their duties; but they denied
the necessity thereof, because without grace they being directed by the word,
were able of themselves, though not so easily, to fulfill the Law.

. III. These three latter degrees are condemned by so many decrees of the
Council of Milevis, among which this is one, C. 3.
denouncing Anathema against such, as shall say, that the grace of God, whereby
we are justified through our Lord Jesus Christ, does avail only to remission
of sins, which are already committed, and not for a help that we may not
commit them: unto which rightly understood we do subscribe, acknowledging,
that by the same grace of God, by which we were elected, redeemed, called,
reconciled, adopted, justified, we are also sanctified: For we profess that
our blessed Savior was given unto us of God, 1 Cor. 1. 30.
not only to be our justification and redemption, but also to be our
Sanctification. And we do acknowledge, that in the Covenant of grace Ier. 31.
33, 34.
the Lord has not only promised remission of sins to those that believe in
Christ; but he has also sworn, Luke 1. 73, 74, 75.
that he will give us, being redeemed and having remission of sin, to worship
him in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our life. And
therefore we do also willingly subscribe to those sentences of Augustine which
Gratian has transcribed into the third part of his decree. De consecr. did. 4
c. 141. Nemo. ex August. depeccat. merit. and remiss. l. 1. cap. 23.
No man takes away sins but Christ alone, who is the Lamb of God taking
away the sins of the world -- Now he takes them away both by forgiving those
that are already committed (among which original sin is contained) and also
by helping that they be not committed, and by bringing us unto life where they
cannot be committed at all. And again, De consecr. did. 4. c. 45 Gratia. ex
August.
the grace which by our Lord Jesus Christ is given, is neither the knowledge of
the divine Law, neither nature, nor remission of sins alone: but it felfe
also causes, that the Law be fulfilled, that nature be freed, that sin
reign not. And this, I De gratia and lib. arb. ad Valentin. c. 14.
presume, is as much as can truly be alleged out of the Fathers: For seeing
they do hold, as we shall hereafter show, justification by faith only; it
cannot be imagined, that they held justification, properly understood, by
inherent graces, unless we can imagine, that they thought there is no
inherent grace but faith only.

. IV. But howsoever the Fathers may be excused, who opposing The use of the
word grace in the Schoolmen and latter writers.
the errors of the Pelagians, which oppugned the sanctifying grace, did much
insist upon the declaration, the proof, and the amplification thereof, oftener
speaking of this gift of grace, which was oppugned, than of the gracious favor
of God in forgiving of sins, which the Pelagians did confess: yet the
backsliding posterity cannot be excused, and that in three respects. For
first, they leave out altogether the proper signification of grace, which is
most frequent in the holy Scriptures, as if there were no other grace to be
acknowledged, but that which is inherent. Secondly, they take away that grace
of remission, which the Pelagians did confess, and in the room thereof they
have brought in an utter deletion or abolition of sin, caused by the infusion
of grace. Thirdly, that grace which they would seem so much to magnify, is
not much better acknowledged by them, than it was by the Pelagians. For first
they do not acknowledge it to be a quickening and reviving grace to them that
are dead: but an healing grace to the sick, and a helping grace to the weak.
And by how much they extol the power of nature, and lessen the foulness of
original sin: so much they extenuat the benefit of grace, and are as well as
the Pelagians, worthily termed the enemies of Gods grace: Secondly, there
seems to be little or no difference between the Pelagians bonum Naturae,
which they acknowledged to be Gods grace, and that sufficient grace, which the
Papists hold to be common to all. Thirdly, neither is there any great
difference between them in respect of that grace whereby men are called. For
the Pelagians acknowledged the great grace of God in revealing his will unto
us, and in directing us what to do and what to believe; and withal confessed,
that God does work in us to will by revealing his will to us. And what do the
Papists acknowldge more? but that God having called us by his word, and moved
us to turn unto August. Epist. 105.
him, it is in the power of our free will either to accept Gods effectual
grace, or to refuse it. But this belongs to another controversy.

A TREATISE OF IV STIFICATION.
THE FOVRTH BOOK: Of the Matter of Justification.
CAP. I. The state of the question concerning the matter of justification, it
being the principal point in controversy.
. I. THE third Capital error of the Papists in the question The state of the
Question.
of justification, is concerning that righteousness whereby we are justified:
where, for prevention of Popish calumniations, I must desire the Reader to
remember three things: First, that the controversy is not concerning our
Sanctification, but concerning our Justification: For we confess, that our
habitual sanctification consists in our righteousness inherent; and
actual, in our new obedience. Secondly, that the question is not of our
justification before men, but before God. For we acknowledge, that we are
justified, that is, declared and known to be just, not only by profession of
the faith, but also by good works, as Saint Iam. ^. 14. 24.
James teaches. Thirdly, that we do not deny, that there is a righteousness
in the faithful, as Bellarmine falsely charge us. For we profess, that there
is no faithful or justified man, in whom there is not inherent righteousness,
more or less, according to the measure of grace received. And further we
profess, that this righteousness which we have from God, and is inherent in
us, is graciously both accepted of him, and rewarded by him; but we deny, that
any man is justified by it. This question therefore is concerning the matter of
justification. For whereas justification, considered as an action of God is his
making or constituting a man righteous, either by Christ's righteousness
imputed (as we teach according to the Scriptures) or by righteousness infused
as the Papists hold: It is therefore apparent, that as according to our
Doctrine, the righteousness of Christ is the matter, and the imputation
thereof the form of justification: so according to their doctrine, inherent
righteousness should be the matter of justification, and the infusion of it,
the form. But howsoever we differ in respect of logical terms in setting
down the state of this controversy, because they against reason make inherent
righteousness the form of justification: yet the true state of the
controversy between them and us is this, whether we be justified before God
by Christ's righteousness, which is out of us in him, imputed to us: or by that
righteousness, which being infused of God is inherent in us: whether it be
the righteousness of God, as the Apostle calls it, that is, of Christ who is
God, inherent in him; or a righteousness from God inherent in us: we hold the
former; the Papists the latter. This, the principal point.


. II. Now this is the principal point of difference between them and us in
this whole controversy, and that in two respects: First, because the
righteousness of God whereby we are justified, is the principal matter
contained or revealed in the Gospel, Romans 1. 16, 17. For which cause we, who
maintain justification by that righteousness of God which is taught in the
Gospel, which the Papists oppugn, are worthily called the professors of the
Gospel, whereof the Papists are professed enemies. Secondly, because upon this
all the other points of difference do depend. For if we were justified by
righteousness inherent, then it would follow. First, that to justify were to
make just by infusion of righteousness inherent. Secondly, that we are
justified by the grace of God, or rather graces inherent in us. Thirdly, that
the form of justification were infusion of righteousness. Fourthly, that
faith does justify as a part of inherent and habitual righteousness; and
therefore also that it does not justify alone. Fifthly, that works justify
as our actual righteousness. But on the contrary, if we be justified by
that righteousness, which is not inherent in us, but out of us in Christ: then
it follows, first, that to justify does not signify making righteous by
justice inherent. Secondly, that we are not justified by inherent grace, but by
the gracious favor of God accepting us in Christ. Thirdly, that we are not
justified by infusion, but by imputation of righteousness. Fourthly, that
faith does not justify as a part of inherent righteousness, but as the hand
to receive Christ, who is our righteousness. Fifthly, that works do not
justify as causes to work, but as fruits and signs to declare and manifest
our justification. The other points prove this.


. III. And as the proof of this infers the rest: so the rest being proved,
are so many proofs of this. For first, if to justify do never in the
Scriptures signify to make righteous by infusion of righteousness, then we
are not justified by inherent righteousness; neither is justification by
inherent righteousness, that justification which the Scriptures teach.
Secondly, if we be not justified by grace inherent then not by habitual or
inherent righteousness, if by the gracious favor of God freely without
respect of any cause of justification in us, then not by works or inherent
righteousness. Thirdly, if by imputation of Christ's righteousness, then not
by infusion of inherent justice. Fourthly, if by faith as it is the hand to
receive Christ's righteousness, then not by righteousness inherent. Fifthly,
if not by works as any cause, then not by inherent righteousness. But the two
first I have fully and clearly proved already; the first in the second book;
and the second, in the third. And the rest I shall by the grace of God
demonstrate in their due place.

. IV. That, which has already been said, both here, and Lib. 1. c. 3. and 4.
and lib. 2. and 3. This point to be proved, in the affirmative part, and in the
negative, first jointly, and then severally.
heretofore, together with that which shall hereafter be produced to prove the
other three points remaining to be proved, might be a sufficient
demonstration of this point. But because the proof of this point, being the
principal, does prove all the rest, as I have showed; therefore I will not
only bring a supply of diverse arguments, by disproving the popish assertion,
and proving our own, but also answer the cavills and objections of the
Papists. And first, I will prove our assertion and disprove theirs jointly and
together: and then severally I will disprove their assertion, viz. that we are
justified by righteousness inherent in ourselves; and prove ours, to wit, that
we are justified by the righteousness of Christ, which is out of us in him.

CHAP. II. That we are justified by Christ's righteousness, and not by that
which is inherent in us, proved jointly by three arguments.
. I. FIrst therefore; That righteousness whereby we are justied Arg. 1. we are
justified by Gods righteousness, and not by ours.
is Gods righteousness, and not ours; The righteousness of Christ, which is
out of us in him, is Gods righteousness, that which is inherent in us, is ours:

Therefore we are justified by the righteousness of Christ, which is out of
us in him, and not by that which is inherent in our selves.

The former part of the proposition is proved out of Romans 1. 17. and 3. 21.
Thus:

The righteousness, which there is said to be revealed in the Gospel, is that
righteousness, by which we are justified. This proposition is confessed of
all.

The righteousness of God is that righteousness, which is revealed in the
Gospel. Romans 1. 17. In the Gospel is revealed the Romans 1. 17.
righteousness of God from faith to faith, as it is written, the just by faith
shall live, Romans 3. 21. The righteousness of God is without the Law manifested
( viz. in the Gospel) even the righteousness of God, which is by faith of
Jesus Christ, unto all and upon all that believe:

Therefore the righteousness of God is that righteousness by which we are
justified.

The whole proposition in both the parts is proved out of Romans 10. 3. where it
is not only signified, that we are justified by Gods righteousness and not
by our own; but there is also such an opposition made betwixt Gods
righteousness and ours in the point of justification; that whosoever seek to
be justified by their own rig^teousnesse, cannot be justified by the
righteousness of God. Wherefore Paul, in the question of his own
justification, renounceth his own righteousness, desiring to be found in
Christ, not having his own righteousness, which is of the Law (as all
inherent righteousness is) but that which is through the faith of Christ, the
righteousness which is of God by faith, Phil. 3. 9.

. 2. The assumption in respect of the former part, viz. that the righteousness
The righteousness of Christ is Gods righteousness. I^r. 23 6.
of Christ is Gods righteousness, is easily proved: first, because Christ is
God, who as ^eremy prophesied, should be called ^ebovah our righteousness,
^er. 23. 6. Now his righteousness is called Gods righteousness, as has been
said* not because it is the righteousness of the Godhead; but because it is
the righteousness of him that is God. For as the blood of Christ, by which we
are redeemed, is Gods blood, Act. 20 28. so the righteousness of Christ, by
which we are justified, is the righteousness of God, and is so called, 2 Cor.
5. 21. Romans 1. 17. 3. 21. 10. 3. and most plainly, 2 Pet. 1. 1. where it is
called the righteousness of God 2 Pet. 1. 1.
and our Savior Jesus Christ; which is an excellent testimony to prove the
Deity of our Savior, like to that, Ti^. 2. ^ 3. for it is not said of God, and
of our Savior, as noting two persons Not (...), but (...).
, but of God and our Savior, as betokening one. Secondly, because it is that
very righteousness of God whereof the Apostle speaks in the places even Romans
1. 17. 3. 21. 10. 3. 2 Cor. 5 21. 2 ^et. 1. 1.
now mentioned, where it is so called, neither because it is the essential
righteousness of God, as I have showed before against Osiander; nor because it
is a righteousness in us from God, for that is perfectly described in the Law,
as this is not, Romans 3. 21. and because that (as I shall show in the proof of
the second part of the assumption) is not called Gods, but ours: but because it
is the righteousness of that person who is God: which, that we should not
think to be any thing in us, is called sometimes his blood, Romans 5. 9.
sometimes his obedien^e Romans 5. 19.
, that is, both his passive and active righteousness, by imputation whereof
those that truly believe The Fathers by the righ^eousnesse of God, und^rstand
Christ and his righteousness.
are made the righteousness of 2 Cor. 5. 21.
God, not in themselves, but in Christ: even as he by imputation of our
sins, was made sin for us.

. III. 3. Because diverse of the Fathers, to whose judgment some of the popish
Salmero. B. Justinian.
Doctors subscribe, by the righteousness of God mentioned in the first, third,
and tenth chapters to the Romans, understand Christ and his righteousness.
Origin in Romans 3. therefore this righteousness of God, quae est Christus,
which is Christ, is manifested without the Law, and so in Romans 10. 3. Ambrose
in Romans 10. 3. Not knowing the justice of God, that is (as he expounds)
ignorantes ^uncesse Christum; the Jews being ignorant that this is the Christ,
whom God had promised, said, another was to be expected, preferring their own
righteousness, which they had by the Law, before him who is the righteousness
of God by faith; justitia n. ipse est, for he himself is the righteousness:
which words we find also in Sedulius in Romans 10. 3. Anselmus in R^. 10. 3.
they are not subject Justiciae Dei, id est, Christo, to the righteousness of
God, that is, to Christ. Remigius in To. 10. 3. Ignorantes Dei justitiam, non
quo ipse justus est essentialiter, sed Christm, etc. They being ignoran^ of the
justice of God, not that whereby he is just essentially, but Christ -- they
would not submit their necks justitiae Dei, id est, Christ^, to the justice of
God, that is, to Christ, and in Romans 3. 21. possumus ipsam justitiam Dei
Patris, id est, Filium intelligere, we may understand the very righteousness
of God the Father, that is to say, the Son from whom and by whom we are
justified -- ipse Christus justitia nostra, Christ himself our righteousness
has testimony from the Law and the Prophets Some to the same purpose
understand the righteousness of faith. Theophilact in To. ^ 10. 3. and
Oecumenius likewise, (...) the faith in Christ he calls the righteousness
of God. Anselmus in Roman. 1. 17. the righteousness of God is revealed in the
Gospel, that is, the righteousness of faith, which was covered in the Law,
for the righteousness of God is that, by which he freely justifies a sinner
(through faith without the works of the Law, Sedulius in Romans 1. 17. the
righteousness of God) because it was just, that as Abraham believing was
justified by faith only, so all others imitating his faith should be saved.
Augustine speaking of those words, Romans 3. 21. (the righteousness of God is
manifested) he did not say (says he) De Spiritu and litera, cap. 9.
the righteousness of man, or the righteousness of our own will, but the
righteousness of God; not whereby God himself is just, sed q^ induit hominem,
but wherewith he endueth a man (which is a metaphore taken from garments) when
he justifies a sinner: where, if Augustine had by righteousness understood
inherent, he should have been confuted out of the very place, which says this
righteousness is revealed without the Law which cannot be verified of inherent
righteousness. And again, Ibid. cap. 11.
this is the righteousness of God, quae testamento veteri velata, in (...)
revelata, which having been covered in the Old Testament (which cannot be said
of righteousness inherent, for all that righteousness which is from God in us,
whether it be habitual consisting in the habit of charity, or actual which
is obedience, is exactly, prescribed in the Law, which is the perfect rule of
all inherent righteousness) is discovered in the New: which is therefore
called the righteousness of God, because by imparting it he makes men
righteous.

. IV. But most agreeable to the words and meaning of the Apostle The exposition
of (...), and the (...) of Papist^.
is the exposition of Theodore^, as it is related by Cardinal in Romans 1. 17.
Tolet, and (...) Romans 1. Dispu^. 7.
Pererius the Jesuit. That by the righteousness of God is meant the
righteousness of Christ, who is both God and man, which he performed for the
redemption of Mankind* thereby fully satisfying the justice of God for us. I
conclude with Pererius, and Cardinal Cajetan. The justice of God is a justice
satisfactory to God for the sins of Mankind by the death (I add, and
obedience) of Christ. And this is called the justice of God, the justice of
faith, or the justice which is by faith, Romans 10. 6. Cajetan in Romans 10. 3. The
justice of God is a justice of satisfaction to God for mankind by the death of
Christ: and in 2 Cor. 5. 21. the righteousness of God in Christ is the merit
of Christ sufficient even to satisfy for us, and to justify us -- which is
called Gods Quod de Deo, tum quia est Deo (...), tu^ quia ^st apud divinum
tribunal vera ^stitia, ad diff^rentiam (...) nostrarum, quia apud divinum
tribun^l s^nt velut pannus menstrua^ae, etc.
both because it is the righteousness of God personally, and also because
before the tribunal of God it is true righteousness, differing from our
righteousness, which before the judgment seat of God are as the cloth of a
menstruous woman: when therefore the merit of Christ is communicated unto us,
then are we made the righteousness of God in Christ, because we are made just
not by our own righteousness, but by the righteousness of God communicated
unto us in Christ: for we are made just before God, by the merit, by the
satisfaction, by the reconciliation made by Christ: and again in Romans 3. 24.
The redemption wrought by Christ, is Gods righteousness, not ours, because
Jesus Christ himself is true God.

This righteousness of Christ, which is called the righteousness of God, by
which we are justified; the Papists (even Bellarmine himself) sometimes
confess to be a plenary satisfaction to God, and by him imputed to them that
believe: and that this righteousness of Christ is the meritorious cause of our
justification, and that by the merit of Christ's righteousness we are
justified: and yet they cannot abide to hear, that it is the matter of
justification: when as we by the matter of justification understand nothing,
but that righteonsnesse, which is imputed to justification. Now it is certain,
that the righteousness of Christ, neither active nor passive, which were
transient, nor the merit thereof, can otherwise be communicated to us, but by
imputation. Even as the actual transgression of Adam, and the guilt thereof,
were by imputation communicated to us. Neither could inherent righteousness
be merited for us unto our sanctification, unless his righteousness it self
and the merit thereof were first imputed to us unto justification: no more than
the actual sin of Adam could have infected us with original corruption, if
his sin and the guilt thereof had not first been imputed to us.

. V. The fecond part of the assumption was, that the righteousness The
righteousness inherent is ours.
inherent in us, is our righteousness: which, one would think should need no
proof. For though we receive it from God, as we do all other good things
which we have, yet it, as well as all other good things, even our daily bread,
which we have received from God, is to be called Matthew. 6. 11.
ours. All good things which we have, are Gods gifts, and yet they are not
called his, but ours. As our bodies, our souls, our life, our liberty, our
learning, our wisdom, our charity, our temperance, our piety, etc. and so our
righteousness. The Papists, and some others do teach, that, that
righteousness is called Gods righteousness, which we shall have from God*
and that ours, which we have from our selves, and by the strength of nature:
whereto I answer, first, there can be no righteousness, which is not the gift
of God, from Jam. 1. 17.
whom all gifts do come. Neither is it credible, that the Jews, who were
instructed in Gods word, should ever look to be justified by a righteousness
not received from God. The Pharisee himself, who trusted unto his own
righteousness, and thought, as the Apostle speaks of the Jews, Romans 10. 3.
to be justified by his own righteousness, acknowledged it to be the gift of
God, and therefore thanked him for it. And hereunto Bellarmine De (...) l. ^ c.
8
elsewhere accords, endeavoring by the example of the Pharisee (who trusted
in himself, as being righteous) to prove that men are not justified by
special faith, or by affiance in Gods special mercy. And lest any should
object, that he trusted to a righteousness which he had of himself, he
adds: Neither can it be said, that the Pharisee had faith or affiance of
Gods benevolence by reason of his own merits, as though he ^eleeved that he
had his righteousness from himself. Nam agebat gratias Deo de sua justitia,
proinde a Deo eam se habere credebat: for he gave God thanks for his
righteousness, and therefore believed that he had it from God. Secondly, the
righteousness of God, by which we are justified, is without the Law revealed
in the Gospel: but all that righteousness which is from God within us, is
fully and perfectly described in the Law.

. VI. Thirdly, as the several parts of inherent righteousness, The several
parts of righteousness inherent ^re called ours.
though received from God, as being his gifts of grace, are notwithstanding
called ours, as our faith, Matthew. 9. 2, 22. Romans 1. 8. Hab. 2. 4. ^am. 1. 3.
Our charity, 2 Cor. 8. 8, 24. 1 Cor. 16. 24. Philem. 1. and 7. Our hope, Phil.
1. 20. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 19. Our good works, Mat. 5. 16. Apoc. 2. 2. Our patience,
Luke 21. 19. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 4. Apoc. 2. 2. 3. 10. 13. 10. So righteousness
inherent is in very many places of Scripture called ours, whereof I will quote
some, Genesis 30. 33. 1 Samuel 26. 23. 2 Samuel 22. 21, 25. 1 King. 8. 32. Job 33. 26.
Psalm. 7. 8. 18. 20, 24. 35. 27. 112. 3, 9. Prove. 11. 5, 6. Eccl. 7. 16. Esa.
5. 23. 64. 6. Ezech. in his 3. 4. 18. and 33. chapters, fourteen times.
Matthew. 5. 20. and 6. 1. according to the Latin, 2 Cor. 9. 9, 10. but there are
two which are most remarkable, Psalm. 4. 1. where David thus calls upon the
Lord, O God of my righteousness, that is, says Bellarmine, in Psalm. 4.
a quo est omnis me^ justitia, acknowledging all his righteousness to be from
God, and yet calls it his own righteousness. Esa. 54. 17. their
righteousness is from me, says the Lord, from God, but yet theirs. If it be
objected out of Augustine, that it is called the righteousness of God, non qua
justus est, sed qua nos justos facit, not whereby he is just, but whereby he
makes us just. I answer, that Christ's righteousness both habitual and
actual, both active and passive is such, for it is not that whereby God, that
is the Godhead is just, but that whereby he makes us just.

Fourthly, whereas the Papists will needs have the righteousness of God, by
which we are justified, and which is the principal matter taught in the
Gospel to be inherent in us, though from God: they confound Gods righ teousnes
and ours, and thereby confound the Law and the Gospel, and by confounding them
abolish the righteousness of God: as before, by confounding justification with
sanctification they abolished the benefit of justification, and evacuate the
Gospel, or at least with the false Apostles, Gal. 1. teach another Gospel
whiles they teach another righteousness whereby to be justified, than the
righteousness of God: which whosoever does, though he were an Apostle, though
an Angel from heaven, Gal. 1. 8. Our second argument. By Christ's righteousness
we stand righteous before God, and not by righteousness inherent.
he ought to be held accursed.

. VII. Our second argument: That is the matter of our justification besore God,
by which we being sinners in our selves (for that justification, which the
Scriptures teach, is the justification Romans 4. 5. 5. 8. 10.
of a sinner) do stand righteous before God; which we being sinners may
oppose to the judgment of God, why he should not condemn us; which we being
sinners may interpose betwixt Gods justice and us; and which we may plead as a
full satisfaction to God for us. Such is the righteousness of Christ: for being
sinners in our selves, yet believing in Christ, we are in 2 Cor. 5. 21. Romans 5.
19.
him accepted and constituted righteous. The righteousness of Christ is that,
which we being sinners in our selves may oppose to Gods judgment, or interpose
betwixt Gods justice and us, which we may plead as a full satisfaction made in
our behalf. For though by our sins we have deserved to be condemned, and to
be excluded from heaven: yet if we believe in Christ, his sufferings are
accepted in our behalf to free us from hell, and his obedience to entitle us
unto heaven. In him we have borne the penalty, in him we have fulfilled the
Romans 10. 4.
Law. Such is not ours: for being sinners in our selves we cannot stand before
God as righteous by justice inherent, neither can we oppose it to Gods
judgment, or interpose it betwixt Gods justice and our sins, or plead it as
a full satis faction. But the best of us must pray with David, Psalm. 143. 2.
Enter not into judgment with thy servant O Lord, for no flesh shall be
righteous in thy sight, namely, if thou enter into judgment with him: and
again, Psalm. 130. 3. 4.
if thou Lord shall mark iniquity, O Lord who shall stand, but there is
forgiveness with thee that thou may be feared. Augustine on those words,
August. in Psalm. 1 29.
Quis sustinebit? Non dixit, ego non sustinebo, sed, quis sustinebit? vidit n.
prope totam vitam humanam circumlatrari peccatis suis, accusari omnes
conscientias cogitationibus s^is, non inveniri cor castum praesumens de sua
justitia. Si ergo cor castum non potest inveniri, quod praesumat de sua
justitia, praesumat omnium cor de misericordia Dei, and dicat Deo, Si
iniquitates observaveris Domine, Domine quis fustinebit? quae a.spes est?
quoniam apud te propitiatio est: and quae est ista propitiatio, nisi
sacrificium? and quod est sacrificium, nifi quod pro nobis oblatum est? Sanguis
innocens fusus delevit omnia peccata nocentium -- -- Ergo est apud te
propitiatio. Nam si non esset apud te propitiatio, si judex solum esse velles,
and misericors esse nolles, observares omnes iniquitates nostras, and
quae^eres, eas, quis sustineret? -- quis staret in judicio tuo? Spes ergo una
est, quoniam est apud te propitiatio. Again, Contr. Crescon. lib. 4.
Augustine and some others do use to join in coherence the 8. and 9. verses
of the 20. Chapter of Prove. 20. 8. 9.
the Proverbs: when the righteous King shall sit on his throne, who can say my
heart is clean? we deny not that there is a righteousness inherent in the
faithful, that it is accepted of God in Christ, that it is graciously
rewarded; but we deny that we are justified thereby. This is not it, in which
we can stand in judgment before the righteous King sitting on his throne.

. VIII. Our third argument: By that righteousness of man, The third argument
because Christ's righteousness is perfect, and not ours.
which only is perfect, we are justified, and not by that which is unperfect.

The righteousness of Christ, which is out of us in him, is the only
righteousness of man which is perfect, and all our inherent righteousness in
this life is unperfect.

Therefore we are justified by the righteousness of Christ, which is out of
us in him, and not by any righteousness inherent in our selves.

The proposition needs no proof; for that justice, which is not perfect,
cannot stand in judgment before God, and is so far from justifying, that it
self is sinful, every imperfection and defect being (...), a transgression of
the Law, and consequently a sin. So long, says Augustine Epist. 29. ad
Hieron. quamdiu augeri potest charitas, (...) illud quod minus est ex vitio est.
, as charity may be increased, assuredly that, which is less than it ought to
be, is vicious: and again Lib. de perf. justis. ad. 15.
more plainly, peccatum est, cum charitas minor est quam debet, it a sin
when charity is less than it ought to-be. I do not say, that the habit of
grace, as faith or charity, or a work of grace, as prayer, or alms giving is
a sin, and much less a mortal sin, as our adversaries charge us: but I
say, that the imperfection or defect of the habit or the work is a sin: and
in respect thereof neither the habit, nor the work, though good, is purely and
perfectly good, but sinful and stained Esai. 64. 6.
with the flesh: which stain to them, who are in Christ Jesus, is venial, and
it notwithstanding, both the habit and the work of grace are cum venia, with
favor and indulgence through the merits and intercession of our Savior in him
accepted: the want and imperfection being by his perfect righteousness and
obedience covered. That the righteousness of Christ is perfect, is also
manifest: And that it is the only righteousness of man which in this life is
perfect, is evidently proved, because all the righteousness of all mere and
mortal men is unperfect. And that I prove by these reasons: The righteousness
of all mortal men is unperfect; first, because all are sinners.


. IX. First, no sinners have perfect righteousness inherent in them.

All mortal men are sinners.

Therefore no mortal man has perfect righteousness inherent in him.

The proposition is manifest: for whiles men be sinners, they cannot be
perfectly righteous. The assumption, viz. that all men are sinners, it is
proved by the common experience of all men in all ages. Secondly, 2
it is grounded upon most plain and undeniable testimonies of holy Scriptures,
which have concluded all men whatsoever under sin. Gal. 3. 22. Romans 3. 23. 1
King. 8. 46. Eccl. 7. 20. Thirdly, it is a 3
confessed and received truth: which therefore the Apostle in his Enthymeme,
Gal. 3. 10. takes for granted. For thus the Apostle argues;

Every one that is a transgressour of the Law, is accursed, therefore

All men whatsoever, even those, who seek by their obedience of the Law to be
justified, are accursed. If any man should deny the consequence of this
Enthymeme, it is to be made good by adding the assumption (which the Apostle
left out as a thing presupposed and taken for granted) thus,

Whosoever is a transgressour of the Law, is by the Law accursed; which the
Apostle expresses in these terms, Gal. 3. 10.
Cursed is every one that continues not in all the things which are written in
the book of the Law to do them.

But all men without exception, even those which seek to be justified by the
Law, are transgressors of the Law: Never any man continued in all the things
which are written in the book of the Law to do them, that is, never any mere
and moral man has so abstained from all evil forbidden, as that he has also
done the things commanded, that he has done all, that he has ever continued
in doing all. Thus Chrysostom understands the Apostle to argue. No man is
justified by the Law, (...), for all have sinned and are under the curse; and
says, that the Apostle by testimony proves (...), that no man has fulfilled
the Law: and Oecumenius likewise in Gal. 3. that the Apostle proves, that even
those who seek to be justified by the Law are under the Curse, why? (...),
because no man, says he, fulfilleth the Law.

Therefore all men without exception, even those which seek to be justified
by the Law, are by the Law accursed: which conclusion is of no force if it be
not granted, that all men are transgressors 4
of the Law. Fourthly, all they who are to pray to God for the forgiveness of
their sins, are sinners: But all, even the best of men are to pray to God for
the forgiveness of their sins. Psalm. 32. 6.
Pro hac (that is, for remission of sins) or abit ad te omnis sanctus, every
godly man shall pray unto thee. Our Savior taught his own Apostles and all
other Christians, to pray daily for remission of sin. Every one says Cyprian
De oratione dominica.
is taught peccare se quotidie, dum quotidie per peccatis jubetur orare, that
he sins daily, seeing he is commanded to pray daily for his sins.
Therefore all, even the best of us are sinners: Fifthly, whosoever 5
does that evil which he would not, and does not that good which he would, is
a sinner, both in respect of commission and omission: but such is the condition
of the best, even of the Apostl^ himself, Romans 7. 15. 19. for so he says,
verse. 25* (...), I my self.

Sixthly, whosoever has sin is a sinner; All men have sin: and that I
prove thus;

Whosoever is a liar himself, and makes God a liar, that says he has no
sin, he undoubtedly is a sinner.

But every man, though he were as holy as the beloved Apostle and Evangelist
Saint John, is a liar himself, and makes God a liar, that says he has no
sin: for if we (says he, including himself) say we have no sin, we
deceive our selves, and the truth is not in us, 1 John 1. 8. if we say that we
have not sinned we make him a liar, and his word is not in us, verse. 10.
Therefore every man, though he be as holy as Saint John himself, is a sinner.

Seventhly, whosoever is free from sin is also free from death: No mortal
man is free from death: Therefore no mortal man is free from sin.

CHAP. III. The question concerning the imperfection of inherent righteousness
further discussed.
. I. TO contradict this argument, that we are not justified Bellarmines proofs
that inherent righteousness is perfect.
by righteousness inherent, because it is unperfect; Bellarmine indeavoureth
to prove that it is perfect both in respect of habitual, and actual
righteousness. But in both he uses to dispute De Iustif l. 2. c. 7. Tertio,
fidem, spem, and charitatem in hac vita posse esse perfectam.
Sophistically: in the first, because some men have been endued with perfect
righteousness: in the second, because some good works of the just are purely
and perfectly good. For though both these assertions were true, as they are
not, yet would they not conclude justification by inherent righteousness. For
first, as touching the persons, the question is not, whether some choice men in
some part of their life, after they have been good and long proficients, do
attain to some perfection; but whether they, and all others, when they are
first justified, are endued with perfect justice: for if they be not then
endued with perfect inherent righteousness, they are not justified by it. Now
justification by habitual righteousness, which they call their first
justification, is incipientium, of incipients: and themselves distinguish
Christians into three ranks, that some are incipients, some proficients, some
perfect. But incipients are such as be infants and babes, either in respect of
age, when being baptized in their infancy, are, as they teach, justified; or
in respect of religion, being new converts. But to imagine, that either
infants, which have not so much as the use of reason, nor are as yet capable of
the habits of Faith, Hope, and Charity, and much less are able to produce the
Acts, to Believe, to Hope, to Love; or new converts, who are like Babes to be
fed Heb. 5. 12. 1 Cor. 3. 2.
with Milk, are endued with perfect righteousness, is a great absurdity.

. II. Yea but, says De Justis. l. 2. cap. 14.. respond^o.
Bellarmine, the works of God are perfect, Deuteronomy. 32. 4. habitual
righteousness is the work of God, therefore it is perfect. Answ. The works
of God are either immediate, and such as Bellarmines argument for habitual
righteousness, because the works of God are perfect.
he works at once; or else mediate, which he works by degrees. The former
are perfect at the first, according to their kind: as were the works of
creation. The latter are not perfect at the first, but by degrees are brought
to perfection: as the work of procreation or carnal generation, and of
Spiritual Re-creation or Regeneration. Adam was the immediate Work of GOD
created at once: and therefore perfect in his kind at the first. Seth also was
the Work of GOD, not immediate by creation, but mediate by Procreation, being
first begotten by his parents and conceived, then formed in the womb, then
borne, then growing from age to age, until he came to be a perfect man. So
it is in the Spiritual Re-creation. For we are the workmanship of God
created Ephesians. 2. 10.
unto good works: but we are not perfect Christians at the first. For we are
first begotten by the incorruptible 1 Pet. 1. 23.
seed of Gods Word, receiving, as it were, the seeds of Gods graces at the
first, being but as Embryons in the womb until Christ Gal 4. 19.
be formed in us. And when we are borne a new, we are at the first but as
newborn Babes, who are to desire the sincere 1 Pet. 2. 1.
milk of the work, that we may grow thereby: and afterward stronger meats,
that we may grow more and more: and then, not contenting our selves with that
measure of growth, which we have attained unto, must still strive toward
perfection, being from day 2 Cor. 4. 16.
to day renewed in the inner man until we come to be adult, grown men, or, as
the Apostle speaks, Phil. 3. 15.
perfecti; and when we are such, (because always in this life we are in our
(...), or growing age, receiving only the first Romans 8. 23.
fruits of the Spirit) we must imitate the Apostle Paul; who, though he far
excelled the most perfect among us, acknowledged, that he had not attained
Phil. 3. 12, 13, 14, 15.
to perfection, but did strive toward it: exhorting all others, who are
perfect, that is, adulti or grown men, to be of his mind; that is, that they
should acknowledging their imperfection still more and more strive toward
perfection.

. III. As touching actual righteousness, he deals also Sophistically:
Bellarmines argument for actual righteousness.
for first, where he should prove, that the works of the faithful are
perfect, or purely and absolutely good, he proves that they are truly good,
and not sins: but especially, when he should prove, that all the works of
the faithful or righteous, are purely and perfectly good; he proves, that
some are. As though a man who is not only guilty of many sins, and infected
with manifold corruptions and infirmities, but also in respect of his former
sins obnoxious to damnation; could be justified by some good works among
many not good. But this is a most erroneous conceit of the Papists, who hold,
that every good work, proceeding from charity, does absolutely deserve heaven;
even as well as any evil work committed against charity deserves hell. As
though by one act of charity the whole Law were fulfilled, as well as by one
act committed against charity the whole Law is broken. He that transgresses
one Commandment, Iam. 2. 10.
though it be but once, is guilty of all. But he does not fulfill the Law,
and much less can be justified by his obedience, whose obedience is not
total, Gal. 3. 10.
perfect, and perpetual. It is true, that a faithful man may be justified,
that is, declared and approved to be just by some one or more good works, as
Abraham Iam. 2. 21, 25.
by offering his son Isaac, and Rahab by her entertaining and delivering of
the Espies; but no man can be justified before God by his works, who is guilty
of any sin. For if Paul 1 Cor. 4 4.
who was not conscious to himself of any sin, was not thereby justified: how
can he that is guilty of any, or rather many sins be justified? For whosoever
is justified before God Romans 4 6.
is blessed, but cursed Gal. 3. 10.
is every one that continues not in all the things, which are written in the
book of the Law* to do them. Reasons proving that the works of the faithful
are not purely and perfectly good. and first, Esa. 64. 6.


. IV. But if it shall evidently appear, that none of the works of the
faithful are purely and perfectly good, how far then are the Papists from
proving justification by works. And this I will prove by diverse arguments,
which I will also maintain against the cavils of the Papists. And first out of
Esa. 64. 6. We are all as an unclean person, or thing, all our righteousnesses
are as a menstruous cloth. Where the Church does freely confess her self and
all her members to be unclean, and all their righteousnesses, that is, all
their most righteous works, to be as polluted clouts: which, though it be a
most pregnant testimony, wherein we have just cause to triumph; yet Bellarmine
De justi^ l. 4. c. 20.. Quarto.
says it is impertinent, and that for three reasons: First, because without
doubt the Prophet speaks not of just men, but of notorious sinners, for whose
sins the City of Jerusalem and people of the Jews was to be delivered into
the hands of the King of Babylon. And that the prophet speaks in the person
of such wicked men, he endeavors also to prove by three arguments: First,
because he a little before had said, because thou art angry and we have
sinned, that is, as Cyrill expounds it, because thou art angry, thou have
forsaken us. But neither is God angry with the just, neither does he forsake
them. I answer no less confidently, but upon better grounds, that without
doubt the prophet speaks in the person of the Church, and namely of the
faithful, who living after the desolation of Jerusalem in the captivity of
Babylon, should bewail their own sins and of the whole people of the Jews,
which had drawn upon them those fearful judgments. For these words are part
of that prayer of the Church of the Jews, which from the seventh verse of the
63. chapter is continued to the end of the 64. And in token of this
continuation, the latter part of the last verse of the former chapter in the
hebrew, is the beginning of this chapter in the Greek, Latin, and other
translations. Now in the former chapter, the same persons, which here confess
their sins, after they had magnified Gods mercies toward them, verse 7. etc.
do say unto God, verse 16. doubtless thou art our Father, though Abraham be
ignorant of us, and Israel know us not: thou O Lord art our Father and our
Redeemer. And in this chapter, as they bewail in this verse their
sinnefulnesse with aggravation: so they desire the Lord (whom they call their
Father) not to remember their iniquities, because they are his people, verse 8.
9. professing their hope of salvation, verse 5. which is not the manner of
notorious and impenitent sinners, but of those that are penitent, and
faithful. And further, that which Esaias here foretells, is accordingly
performed: First, by Daniel, chap. 9. from the fourth verse to the twentieth,
who in like manner in the name and behalf of the desolate Church of the Jews,
prays unto God, confessing his own sins and of the people of Israel, as he
speaks, verse 20. Secondly, by the Church in captivity, which send the like
prayer written by Baruch to the priest and people, who then were at Jerusalem.
Baruch 1. from the 15. verse of the first chapter to the end of the third.

. V. This then is the confession of the Church, which according That in Esa.
64. 6. to be the confession of the faithful, proved by testimonies.
to Tertullians rule, is to be extended* unto the faithful in all times: and
so it is understood by Origin in Romans 3. lib. 3.
who says, that no man may glory of his own righteousness, seeing here it is
said, that all our righteousness is as the cloth of a menstruous woman: by
Hierome in locum.
, we shall be saved only by thy mercy, who of our selves are unclean. And
what righteousness soever we seem to have, is compared to a cloth of a
menstruous woman. By Augustine, De tempore sermon. 43.
all our righteousness compared with divine justice is accounted like the
cloth of a menstruous woman, as the Prophet Esaias says, etc. and again, Tom. 9.
soliloq. c. 28.
whatsoever an unclean person touches shall be unclean: but all we are as
the cloth of a menstruous woman, coming from a corrupt mass and unclean, we
bear in our foreheads the spot of our uncleanness, which we cannot conceal,
at least from thee, who see all things. By Bernard in diverse places? First,
for De verbis Esai^, Nostra n. (si qua est) bumilis instit^a recta for sitan,
sed non pura, etc.
our humble righteousness, if we have any, is perhaps right but not pure:
unless peradventure we believe our selves to be better than our forefathers,
who no less truly than humbly said, all our righteousness is like the cloth
of a menstruous woman: for how can there be pure justice, where as yet fault
cannot be wanting. And again, In festo omnium Sanctorum sermon. 1.
what can all our righteousness be before God? shall it not, according to the
Prophet, be reputed as the cloth of a menstruous woman? and all our
righteousness, if it be straightly judged, will it not be found unjust and
defective? What then will become of our sins, seeing our righteousness
cannot answer for it self? wherefore crying earnestly with the Prophet, Enter
not into judgment with thy servant O Lord, let us in all humility have
recourse to mercy, which alone can save our souls. Thirdly, De verbis
Origenis.
if I shall be just, I will not lift up my head, for all my righteousnesses
before him are as the cloth of a menstruous woman. Fourthly, De verbis^
Apostoli, 1 Cor. 1. 31.
it is perfect and secure glorying, when we fear all our works, as blessed
Job testifies of himself, and when we acknowledge with the prophet Esaias,
that all our righteousnesses are to be reputed no other, than the cloth of a
menstruous woman. Fifthly, De decic. Ecclesia, sermon. 5.
surely if all our righteousnesses being viewed at the light of truth shall be
found like a menstruous cloth, what then shall our unrighteousnesses be found
to be? And to the like purpose I might allege Dionys. Carthus. in Psalm. 142.
Gerson. tom. 3. de Consolat. lib. 4. pros. 1. and tom. 4. tr. de sign. Cajetan.
in 2 Cor. 5. 21. Jacob. Clict. in Canonem apud Cassandrum consult. art. 6.

operibus teximus, stillamus saniem diversorum criminum; all our righteousnesses
are like the cloth of a menstruous woman: wherefore continually upon the cloth
of a good life, which we weave by the works of righteousness, we drop the
filthy matter of diverse crimes.

. VI. But let us briefly examine Bellarmines proofs, where to Answer to Bellar
mi^es proof first, from the words going before.
omit Cyrill, who understands the place, contrary to Bellarmines conceit, of
the wicked Jews, who, after they had crucified Christ, persisted in their
infidelity: his first reason is from the words going before, V. 5.
because God is not angry with the just, nor forsakes them, but according to
our doctrine (forsooth) he covers their sins, and imputes them not. I
answer, first, that when the children of God do^ sin, God is angry, as the
Prophet here says; behold, when we sin thou art angry. God was angry with
Moses, Exodus 4. 14. Deuteronomy. 1. 37. with Aaron, Deuteronomy. 9. 20. with David, 3 Sam.
11. 27. Psalm. 38. 3. 88. 16. with Solomon, 1 King. 11. 9. with his people,
Psalm. 85. 4, 5. Esai. 47. 6. with the sheep of his pasture, Psalm. 74. 1.
with his faithful servants, Esai. 12. 1. Secondly, that by their sins 1 Cor.
11. 29, 30.
they provoke Gods judgments, the fruits of his anger: from which they are so
far from being exempted, that judgment begins 1 Pet. 4. 17.
at the house of God. Thirdly, that if they meet Am. 4. 12. 1 Cor. 11. 30, 31.
Psalm. 32. 4.
not the Lord in his judgments, and do not judge themselves, then are they
sure to be judged of the Lord* For though he does not hate them, nor execute
upon them the fruits of his eternal anger: yet he is angry with his children
when they sin, (for to sin against him is to offend him) and for their sins he
does many times judge and correct them: but our comfort is, when we are judged,
we are chastized 1 Cor. 11. 32.
of the Lord, that we should not be condemned with the world. Fourthly, that
they are patiently to bear the anger of God, because they have deserved it,
Lam. 3. 39. Mic. 7. 9. I will bear the indignation of the Lord, because I have
sinned against him. And as touching Gods forsaking of his Children (whereof
notwithstanding there is no mention in this place) it is certain, that
although he does never utterly or finally forsake his children, Psalm. 37. 25.
28. Heb. 13. 5. Psalm. 89. 33. 2 Cor. 4. 9. yet sometimes they are subject to
spiritual and temporal desertions for a time, wherein God is said to hide his
face from them, as it is here said, verse. 7. see Deuteronomy. 31. 17, 18. Job 13. 24.
Psalm. 22. 1. 88. 14. 2 Chronicles. 32. 31. Esai. 8. 17. 54. 8. Ier. 39. 24. 29.
Iud. 6. 13. Psalm. 77. 7. Es^i. 49. 14. and 62. 4. Howbeit that is verified of
them, which the Lord professes to his Church by his Prophet Esai. c. 44. 7, 8.
for a small moment have I forsaken thee, but in great mercies will I gather
thee. In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but with
everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, says the Lord thy redeemer.

. VII. His second proof is from the words following, verse. 7. His second
proof from the words following.
And there is none that calls upon thy name, nor stands up to take hold of
thee. But the just do call upon God: therefore the prophet does not speak in
the person of the just. Answ. Ordinarily the godly do give themselves to
prayer: though sometimes, when they are left unto themselves, they do neglect
it. But as ordinarily they do not neglect this duty; so when they have
neglected it, their manner is, as in this place, Psalm. 109. 4.
to complain of the neglect thereof. For according to this prophecy, Daniel
and the remnant of Judah which were in captivity, in whom it was fulfilled, use
the very same complaint in their prayer, Dan. 9. 13. Baruch 2. 8.

. VIII. His third proof is out of the words themselves: where His third proof
from the words of the text.
the righteousness of them that make this prayer is compared to a menstruous
cloth, and therefore, says he, he speaks not in the person of the just whose
good works in the Scriptures are highly commended. Ans. It is not likely, that
the hypocrites, who use to trust in their own righteousness, and to boast of
it, would complain of the defectivenesse thereof. But howsoever the godly,
though weak indevors of the faithful are graciously accepted of God in Christ,
and freely rewarded; yet the children of God, when they are humbled under the
hand of God, or do summon and present themselves before the judgment seat of
the Lord, or in their souls do exercise judgment according to the testimony
of their own conscience; they do use to judge and condemn themselves, and to
speak as basely of themselves and of their works, as the faithful do in this
place, we are as an unclean person (that is, as a Leper, who according to the
Law was to cry out, I am unclean, I am unclean, Levit. 13. 45.) and all our
best actions are stained with the flesh like a polluted cloth, or as Dan. cap.
9. and the remnant of Judah, Baruch c. 1. 2, 3. in whom this prophecy was
fulfilled; who speak most basely of themselves, and of their actions. Yea, the
more godly a man is, the more sensible he is of his corruption, and the more
ready with aggravation to confess it. Quanto, says Gregory, Moral lib. 9.
cap. 28.
ad Deum verius per bona opera surgimus, tanto subtilius vitae nostrae sordes
agnoscimus, by how much more truly we arise to God by good works, by so much
the more exquisitely we acknowledge the pollutions of our life: and again,
Ibid. in summario.
with how great cleanenesse soever holy men do shine, notwithstanding by
reason of this body, wherein they are, which is corrupted, they judge
themselves abominable, and by reason of the filth of concupiscences, without
which they are not, they repute themselves unclean: and to the like purpose
Cardinal De Iustisicat. Uiri sancti quanto magis in sanctitate pro siciunt,
tanto minus sin placent.
Cont. Godly men, says he, by how much the more they profit in godliness, by
so much the less they please themselves: Especially, when they are summoned,
or do summon themselves to appear before God, as every one ought to do, who
would be justified, either before God, or in the Court of his own Conscience.
Job the most holy and righteous in his time, when he stood before God,
abhorred Job 42. 5, 6.
himself, repenting in dust and ashes. The holy Prophet Esaias, when in a
vision he beheld God sitting on a throne attended by the Seraphin proclaiming
Holy Esa. 6. 3, 5.
, Holy, Holy, the Lord God of hosts; exclaimeth, Woe is me, I am undone, for I
am a man of polluted lips and dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
lips, Esa. 6. 5. The faithful are Mat. 5. 3.
(...), beggars in spirit, who acknowledging that there is nothing in them
whereby they might hope to be justified or saved; as beggars, rely wholly upon
the mercies of God and merits of Christ, renouncing their own merits, and in
the question of justification deresting them as polluted clouts, as dung, Phil.
3. 8, 9.
as loss, and acknowledging themselves in themselves, to be wretched sinners:
for as Herome Advers. Pelag. dial. 1.
says, Tunc ergo iusti sumus quando nos peccatores fatemur, then are we just
when we confess our selves to be sinners. But the pharisaicall Papist, if he
be once justified, as by their doctrine all are, for a time at the least, who
either are baptized or absolved; he must think that in him there is no sin,
nothing that God can justly hate. And therefore far be it from him to make
such a confession as this, or to cry out with the Apostle, Wretched man that I
am, who shall deliver me from this body of death? Romans 7. 24.

. IX. His second reason to prove this allegation to be imperitnent His second
reason that this testimony of Esaias is impertinent.
is this: Because although Esaias should speak of all, that is, of that whole
people: yet he does not speak of all, at all times, but only of the people
of the Jews at that time, who for their extreme wickedness were delivered
into captivity, as appears by the words following, verse 10. Zion is a
wilderness, Jerusalem a desolation, the Temple burnt, etc. Answ. These words
do prove that the Prophet in this place does not speak in the person of the
wicked Jews that lived in his time before the desolation of Jerusalem, but of
the remnant of the faithful and penitent Jews, who being in captivity bewail
their sins, and lament the desolation of the Temple and City. And therefore
what is said of them, may be extended to the faithful in all times, being, as
these were, humbled before God for their sins, as penitent suppliants.

. X. His third reason, because the Prophet speaking only of the wicked His
third reason.
of that time, means not all their works, as though all were sins (for
then Bellarmine must confess that the best works of the unregenerate are but
splendida peccata) but such as they accounted to be their righteousness, as
their sacrifice, and new-moones, and other ceremonial observatious wherein
they placed their righteousness, which, because they were not (...) with a
good intention, nor as they ought, are worthily compared (but not by them) to a
menstruous cloth, and are rejected by God, Esa. 1. 11. Answ. Here Bellarmine
takes for granted, that the Prophet speaks of the works of the wicked only
of that time, which I have disproved. Or if he had spoken of the wicked, it
were more probable either that they should place their righteousness in moral
works, if they had any, rather than in ceremonial, or if they placed the top
of their righteousness (as hypocrites many times do) in ceremonial
observations, that they would compare those things, which they so highly
esteemed, to menstruous clouts. But he speaks of all the persons, All we,
and therefore including the righteous, if there were any at all among them, as
some there were both before the captivity and in it, and of all their
righteousnesses, and therefore not of their ceremonials only, but also of
their morals. Neither might they perform the chief of their ceremonials
during their captivity being in a foreign land. Our second reason that the
work of the faithful are not purely and perfectly good, because there is in
them a mixture of sin. proved sirst out of Exo. 3. 28. 36. 38.


. XI. Secondly, that the good works of the faithful in this life are not
purely and perfectly good, I prove, because in all our best actions there is a
mixture of evil, either by the absence or defect of some good thing which
ought to be therein, or by the presence of some fault or corruption, which
ought not to be in them. And this I prove: first, out of Exodus 28. 36. 38.
where the high Priest, who was the figure of Christ, is appointed to wear on
his forehead a plate of pure gold, which is also called an holy coronet, Exodus
29. 6. Levit. 8. 9. engraven with this inscription, Holiness of the Lord; and
so the 72. translate it, (...), of the Lord, that is, of Christ, who is the
Ier. 23 6.
Lord our righteousness. The end wherefore he was to wear it, was, that Aaron
might bear the iniquity of the holy things which the children of Israel should
hallow, in all their holy gifts. And it was always to be on his forehead, that
they (the holy gifts) might be accepted before the Lord: where we are plainly
taught, that in all our best actions and holy services which we perform to
God, there is iniquity, which must be taken away by the holiness and
righteousness of Christ imputed unto us, otherwise they cannot in themselves
be accepted of God.

. XII. Secondly, out of Eccl. 7. 20. There is not a just man upon the Secondly,
out of Eccl. 7. 10. Quisecerit bonum and non poccarit.
earth, that does good, and sins not; that is, who in doing good sins
not. For if the meaning were only thus, as Bellarmine would have it, that none
are so just, but that sometimes they sin, according to that, 1 King. 8. 46.
those words, that does good were superfluous: for there is no just man that
does not good. But his meaning is, that there is no just man upon earth, who
doing good sins not, that is, which does good so purely and perfectly, as
that he does not sin therein. For to the perfecting of a good work many
things must concur, the want of any whereof is a sin. The truth of this does
best appear in the particulars; Prayer is a good work, and so is the hearing
of the word, etc. but there is no man does so pray, or so hear the word, but
that when he has done, he has just cause to pray unto God to forgive his
defects and defaults, both in the one and the other. And in this sense Luther
did truly hold, that justus in omni opere bono peccat, that a just man sins
in every good work. Not that the work in respect of its kind, or per se, is a
sin, as if we said that prayer, etc. is a sin, but per accidens, because
in that good work, there happens a defect, which defect is a sin, not
mortal to them who are in Christ, but venial. And thus Augustine also seems
to understand this place. For speaking of the imperfection of charity in this
life, he says, Episto la. 29.
that so long as it may be increased profecto illud quod minus est quam debet,
ex vitio est, ex quo vitio non est justus in terra qui faciat bonum and non
peccet; assuredly that which is less than it ought to be, is out of vice; by
reason of which vice there is not a just man upon earth, who does good and
sins not, by reason of which vice no living man shall be justified before
God: and in another place, more plainly, he says, De perfect. iustitia
resp^ad. 15.
peccatum est cum charitas minor est quam esse debet, it is a sin when
charity is less than it ought to be. Thirdly, such as is the tree such is the
fruit


. XIII. Thirdly, such as is the tree, such is the fruit. The tree is corrupt in
part: For even in the best there is the Old man and the New, the flesh and the
Spirit, betwixt Gal. 5. 17.
which there is a perpetual conflict, so that we cannot do the things we
would, and much less as we would, To. 7. 18, 19. 21
but all, even our best actions are stained with the flesh: which is such a law
in us, that when we would do good, evil is present with us.

. XIV. Fourthly, actions absolutely good may stand in judgment Actions purely
good maystand in judgment.
before God. But our works cannot stand in judgment. The best of us have need
to pray with him, who had less need than we: Psalm. 143. 2.
Enter not into judgment with thy servant O Lord. If Psalm. 130. 3.
thou Lord should mark what is amiss, even in our best actions, who should
be able to stand? Noliergo intrare mecum in judicium Domine Deus meus:
wherefore enter not into judgment with me O Lord my God: August. in Psa. 142.
Quantumlibet rectus mihi videar, producis tu de the sauro tuoregulam, coaptas
me adeam, and pravas invenior. For though I seem to my self never so right,
thou bring forth of thy treasury a rule, thou examinest me by it, and I am
found wicked. This which David, and Augustine expounding him, speak in respect
of the person, may be applied to his best actions; as namely to his prayer,
unto which more specially David in both places does seem to have relation.
Lord hear my prayer, etc. and enter not into judgment with thy servant. Lord
hear my voice, etc. if thou should mark what is amiss, who should stand?
For though my prayer (may the best of us say) seem to my self never so godly,
yet thou have a rule, according to which if thou should exactly examine my
prayer, it would be found sinful. Alas, Lord, I do not pray with that
humility in respect of mine unworthiness, nor with that feeling of my want,
nor with that reverence of thy great and glorious Majesty, nor with that
attention of mind, nor with that devotion and fervencie of Spirit, nor with
that assurance of faith, etc. that I ought to do. Therefore I come unto thee,
not in any conceit of mine own righteousness, or of the worthiness of my
prayer; but I come unto thee in the name and mediation of Christ, appealing
from thy tribunal of justice to the throne of thy grace, desiring and
believing, that the incense of my prayers, being perfumed with the odours of
his merits, may and shall be acceptable unto thee.

. XV. But if any popish pharisee does think, that he needs not Appeal to
the conscience of the Papists.
thus to pray, I shall desire his Conscience thus to speak unto him: Do
thou think, that for the worthiness of thy prayer thou shall be heard, and
that if the Lord should enter into judgment with thee according to his exact
rule, he could find no fault with thy prayer? Alas, besides those blemishes
and imperfections even now mentioned, whereof the most godly have just cause to
complain: thou directest thy prayer not to God alone, but to Saints and
Angels, and so committest horrible idolatry: and when thou do direct thy
prayer unto God, thou do conceive of him under some bodily shape, whereby
thou do circumscribe him, and make him finite, and so no God, but an idol
of thine own brain. Thou do not come unto God, in the name and mediation
of Christ alone, who is the only mediator betwixt God and man, but in the
mediation of many others, by whose merits and intercession thou hopest and
desire to be heard. Thou cravest not the help of the Holy Ghost the Spirit
of grace and supplication, whose help thou find not thy self to need for
such a prayer as thou do make. Thy prayer is but a formal recital of a
certain task of words, uttered for the most part without understanding,
without feeling, without devotion, without faith. Thou, if unlearned, as the
most are, thou prayest in an unknown language, speaking like a Parrat thou
know not what, thy prayer is a mere lip-labor, thou hopest by the
multitude Matthew. 6. 7.
of thy words, and the often repetitions of thy Ave-maries, thy Pater-nosters
and thy Creeds, most ridiculously and odiously reiterated upon thy Beads by
most superstitious Matthew. 6. 7.
Battology. And notwithstanding all this, will thou be so wickedly impudent,
as to obtrude thy orisons unto God, not only as an acceptable service,
wherewith, though he should enter into judgment with thee, he could find no
fault, but also impetratory of thy desires, satisfactory for thy sins, and
meritorious of eternal life? Nay, I assure thee, that thy prayer to God with
the opinion of satisfaction and merit, though it were otherwise well qualified
(as it is far from it, there being nothing almost performed in it which is
required in prayer) it were abominable in the sight of God: what shall I say
more? The acceptable and effectual prayer is the prayer of faith, Iam. 5. 16.
whereby a man does specially believe, Matthew. 21. 22. Mark. 11. 24. Iam. 1. 6, 7.
that his requests are or shall be granted to him, as namely for remission of
sins and eternal life: but thou (I speak to the best and most learned of
the Papists) thou I say do scorn and detest this special faith, and so thy
prayer, wanting faith, besides all other the abominations thereof, is turned
into sin.

. XVI. So in like manner in respect of the rest of our actions, though seeming
laudable unto us; we must pray, that the Lord will not enter into judgment
with us. To which purpose manifold testimonies Testimonies of Fathers.
of the Fathers might be alleged. These few may serve, In Psalm. 142.
Hilarie what living man can be justified in the sight of God? In whom there
is a mixture of anger, of sorrow, of concupiscence, of ignorance, of
forgetfulness, of casualty, of necessity happening either through the nature
of the body, or the motion of the soul always wavering.

Augustine Confess. l. 9. c. 13. vae etiam laudabili vitae hominu^ si remota
misericordia disculias came.
, woe to the very laudable life of men, if mercy being removed thou do
examine it. Gregory in many places of his Morals, lib. 5. c. 7. quia s^pe ipsa
justitia nostra ad examen divinae justitiae deducta, injustitia est, and sordet
in districtione judicis, quod inestimatione sulget operantis, lib. 5. cap. 18.

illo examine etiam justorum vita succumbit, and cap. 14. on those words of Job.
Si habuero quippiam justum, non respondebo, he says, ut enim sape diximus

insudemus, veram munditiem nequaquem apprehendimus, sed ^mur, lib. 27. cap. 15.
Sciunt Sancti, quia omnis humana justitia injustitia est, si divinitus
districte (...): and in the conclusion of his work, lib. 35. cap. 26. wherein
as he professes that he sought chiefly to please God, so he confesses,
that this intention was accompanied with other worse intentions and sinister
respects as seeking to please men, and affecting their praise: whereupon he
infers, Si autem de his divinitus, districte discutimur, quis inter ista
remanet salutis locus: quando and mala nostra pura mala sunt, and bona, quae
nos (...) credi^s, pura bona esse nequaquam possunt: the evil things, says
he, which we have, are purely and merely evil, but the good things which we
suppose our selves to have, are not, nor can in any wise be purely good, and so
said De verb. Esaiae ser^. 5.
Bernard, Nostra siqu^ est humilis justitia, recta forsan, sed non pura: whence
it follows necessarily that none of the works of the faithful are pure, and
consequently that their very best works are impure.

This which has been said may suffice to a conscience not cauterized; neither
shall I need to say any more in this needless argument. For though it should
be granted that some of the works of the faithful were purely good, (as they
are not) yet so long as any of their works are sinful, as in many things we
fail Iam. 3. 2.
all, insomuch that the righteous (as Bellarmine himself does cite the place)
does fall Pro. 24. 1^.
seven times a day, they cannot be justified by their works, but are by the
sentence of the Law in themselves accursed: because they do not continue in
all the things which are written in the book of the Law to do them: and
because the breach of any one commandment makes them guilty of all. I
conclude against the Papists as Hares. 59. (...)
Epiph^ius did censure the Catharists, these men professing themselves pure, by
this supposition make themselves unpure, for whosoever pronounces himself to
be pure, therein he does utterly condemn himself to be impure.

CAP. IV. Bellarmines arguments answered.
. I. THis was our third argument taken from the imperfection His first
testimony, Job 1. 22
of our obedience and righteousness, which I have defended against Bellarmines
cavils: before I proceed to the fourth, I hold it needful to answer his
arguments in propounding whereof he falls short of his projects: as I noted
before, for he that would prove that men are justified by their works; had
need to prove, that all the works of all the faithful, are purely and
perfectly good, which is impossible to be proved: but he neither concludes
of all works nor of all the faithful. And yet it is most certain, that if the
faithful be justified by their works, then all the works of all the faithful
are purely and perfectly good. His proofs are of three sorts: authority of
Scriptures, Testimonies of Fathers, and other reasons. Out of the Scripture he
cites eight testimonies De Iustif. lib. 4 cap. 15.
The first out of Job 1. 22. In all these things Job sinned not with his lips:
And that we may not answer with some Non peccavit Job labiis suis.
of the Rabbis, that though he sinned not with his lips, yet he might sin
in his heart: he tells us, that in the next Chapter, Job 2. 3.
God gives him this testimony, that still he retained his innocence; and
therefore sinned neither in his tongue, nor in his heart. Again, whereas Satan
sought by so many temptations to bring Job to sin, and God on the other side
permitted all those temptations, that the patience and virtue of that holy man
should be manifested; if Job should have sinned, God should after a sort have
been over come by the devil: wherefore it is certain, that that work of Jobs
patience was not stained with any sin; and that the Lutherans, which say the
contrary, take part with the devil against God.

. II. Answ. Those temptations were permitted by God, as tyrals Answer to his
allegation out of Job 1. 22.
of Job, not perfection, but integrity. For that is Gods end, that they who are
(...), sound and upright may be known, 1 Cor. 11. 19. and this end was
achieved, Cap. 2. verse. 3. for still Job retained his integrity. But Satan's
intention was to prove him to be an hypocrite, and to move him not only to
fall, but to fall away from God, and to blaspheme him to his face and so much
he undertook both Cap. 1. 11. and Cap. 2. 5. howbeit he failed in his
enterprise. And so much is signified in both the places alleged by Bellarmine:
that Job was so far, either from blaspheming God to his face, which Satan
undertook he should, that he offended not with his lips, nor charged God
foolishly; or, from being discovered to be an hypocrite, that by Gods own
testimony he retained his integrity, as that word signifies which Tummath.
Bellarmine, according to the vulgar Latin, calls innocence. But Job though
he were upright and sincere, yet he was not perfect, nor without sin; as
appears by his manifold imperfections, which afterward he discovered Cap. 3.
etc. and also by his free confession of his sinfulness, Cap. 9. 20. 33. and
lastly by his fear and jelousie, which he had over his best actions lest he
had sinned in them: for as Moral. lib. 9. c. 2 262
Gregory writing on those words of Job, Verebar omnia opera mea, Job 9. 28.
understands it to be an humble confession, as if he had said, quae aperte
egerim video, sed quid in his latenter pertulerim, ignoro, what overtly I
performed, I see: but what covertly I suffered therein, I know not. But here
may be objected, which Bellarmine in the next Chapter alleges out of the said
Epist. ad August. resp. 10.
Gregory, Bonarum mentium est, ibi etiam aliquo modo culpam agnoscere, ubi
culpa non est, it is the property of good minds even there to acknowledge a
fault, where nofault is, whereto I answer, that Gregory speaks in regard of
humane infirmities which were laid upon man after his fall, (and namely of the
monthly infirmity of women) which though they be not inflicted upon a man for
his personal offenses: yet it is the property of good minds to esteem them as
laid upon them for their sins. Thus Job, though his afflictions were not
inflicted upon him, as corrections for his sins, but as trials of his virtue;
yet he imputes them to his sins, Job 13. 26.

. III. In the second place he allegeth diverse testimonies out of the Two
alegations out of the Psalms, answered.
Psalms wherein David pleads his own innocence, and appealeth unto God to
be judged according to his own righteousness Psalm. 7. 4. 9. 16. 1, 2, 3. 18.
2. 1. 26. 1. 119. 121. Answ. In some of these places David pleads the justice
of his particular cause against his adversaries, not the absolute innocence of
his person. The rest are to be understood of his uprighttnesse and integrity.
For otherwise, no man was more forward to confess and to deplore his manifold
sins, than David was; none more ready to implore Gods mercy, none more
fearful that God should enter into strict judgment with him.

. IV. His third testimony is Matthew. 6. 22. If thine eye be single, the whole
body shall be lightsome: where Bellarmine, without any His third testimony
Matthew. 6. 22.
probability, by the body understands a good work, and by the single eye, a
right intention: for who knows not, that many times works are done with good
intentions that are not good. This place in Matthew is diversely expounded, and
may be applied to many purposes. But the proper true meaning may be gathered
out of the coherence, as I have showed elsewhere Sermon. in Mat. 6. 33.
for in the latter part of that Chapter our Savior shows, both what in our
judgments we should esteem out chief good, verse. 19. etc. and consequently,
what in our afflictions and endeavors we should chiefly desire and labor
for, verse. 25. etc. 33. As touching the former, he exhorts us not to lay up
our treasure upon earth, but in heaven; that is, that we should place our
happiness, not in earthly, but in heavenly things. For where our treasure is,
there will our heart be also. That is, whatsoever we esteem our chiese good,
upon that our hearts and affections will be set. This judgment, concerning our
chief good, is by our Savior compared to the eye; whereunto, whether it be
right or wrong, the whole corpse or course of our conversation, which he
compares to the body, will be suitable. If we repose our happiness in heaven,
our conversation will be religious and heavenly, but if we place our paradise
on earth, our conversation will be answerable. As for example, if pleasure be
our chief good, our conversation will be voluptuous; if profit, it will be
covetous; if honor, it will be ambitious. Such therefore as our judgment is
concerning happiness, such will be our desires, our endeavors, and in a word,
such will be our whole conversation. But as his allegation is to no purpose,
so his conclusion is besides the question, as if we held that good works were
in their own nature mortal sins: when notwithstanding we acknowledge them
to be good, per se, and in their kind; as namely prayer, and almes-giving, but
sinful by accident, as being stained with the flesh.

. V. His fourth testimony is, 1 Cor. 3. 12. If any man build upon His fourth
Testimony 1 Cor. 3. 12.
this foundation, gold, silver, stones of price, etc. where he supposes by
gold and silver good works are understood, etc. Answ. If they were, they might
be good, and yet not purely good. Even as a wedge of gold or of silver, is
truly called gold or silver, though there be some dross therein. But the
Apostle speaks not of works, but of doctrines: for he comparing himself and
other preachers of the Gospel to builders, says, that he, as a master builder
had laid the foundation, whereon others did build, either sound and profitable
doctrines, which he compares to gold and silver, etc. or unsound and
unprofitable, compared to hay and stubble.

. VI. His fifth testimony is, Iam. 3. 2. In many things we offend His fifth
Testimony Iam. 3. 2.
all; Why I pray; says he, does he not say, in all things we offend all: for
if all the works of the righteous be sins, then not only in many things, but
in all we offend. But Saint James knew what to say, for in the second chapter
he had distinguished good works from sins. If you perform the royal Law
according to the Scriptures, thou shall love thy neighbor as thy self, you
do well: but if you accept persons, you commit sin, and are reproved of the
Law as transgressors. Answ. The advice of Saint James in this place is, that
we should not be many Masters, that is, Censurers of our brethren; knowing,
that by censuring and judging of others we shall receive the greater
judgment, according to Matthew. 7. 1. Romans 2. 1. For he that will take upon him
to censure other men's offenses, had need to be free from offense. But we, says
Saints James, (...) that is, (...), we all of us offend many ways, we are
subject to manifold sins and corruptions. For the Apostle does not speak of
the singular individual acts, but of the diverse sorts of sin. As sins
against God, our neighbor, or our selves: sins of omission, and commission:
sins in deed, in thought, and in word: which last kind being the fault of
Censurers, is as he notes in the next words, most hard to be refrained: when
as the Apostle therefore speaking of all, and including himself, though he
were worthily called James the just, says, that many ways we offend all; he
signifies, that even the best of us are subject to manifold corruptions,
causing us many ways to offend according t^ the several kinds thereof: which
is a manifest evidence, that we, being sinners, cannot be justified by
inherent righteousness, especially, if that be added, that as we sin many
ways according to the several kinds of sin; so in our good works, which
are good in their kind, as in prayer, alms giving, etc. we offend by reason
of the flesh, which polluteth all our best actions. But howsoever we say, that
our righteousnesses are stained with the flesh: yet we distinguish them from
our unrighteousnesses, and with Saint James we distinguish good works from
sins; things commanded from things forbidden; things according to their kind
good, but by accident sinful, from things which according to their kind are
absolutely evil.

. VII. His sixth testimony is from those places which exhort us not to Sixthly,
from those places which exhort us not to sin.
sin, as Psalm. 4. 4. Esa. 1. 16. John 5. 14. 2 Pet. 1. 10. 1 John 2. 1. For
to what purpose serve these exhortations or admonitions, if in every good work
we cannot but sin.

Answ. These exhortations do not show, what we are able to do, but what we
ought to do. Neither are they to no purpose,* for first, they restrain men
and especially the children of God from many particular sins. Secondly,
though they exhort us to those things, which in this corrupt estate we are not
able perfectly to perform, as generally to abstain from all manner of sin,
and to avoid all imperfectionsand defects, which are incident unto our best
actions; yet they are to very good purpose. For they serve to discover unto us
our imperfections, and to show that perfection whereunto we ought to aspire; to
moveus not to perform our duties perfunctorily, but to walk (...) Ephesians. 5. 15.
accurately, making conscience of all our ways; to admonish us not to rely
upon our own righteousness, which is so unperfect; but to bewail our
imperfections, and to crave pardon; to teach us what need we have of the
imputation of Christ's righteousness, and of his intercession for us: and
lastly, to move us with an upright endeavor to keep all Gods Commandments
with our whole heart, and to strive toward that perfection which in this life
we cannot attain unto, which if we do, our labor shall not be vain in
the Lord. For the Lord in his children accepts l 1 Cor. 15. 58.
of the will 2 Cor. 8. 12.
for the deed, and of their upright endeavors for perfect performance. So long
therefore as we are upright before God, our imperfections ought not too much to
discourage us; knowing, that his grace 2 Cor. 12. 9.
is sufficient for us, and that his strength is made perfect in our weakness.

. VIII. His seventh testimony is taken from those places which Seventhly, from
those places which testify that the works of just men do please God.
teach that the works of the righteous do please God, Mat. 3. 4. Sap. 9. 1. 2
Act. 10. 35. 1 Pet. 2. 5. Phil. 4. 18. But nothing can please God, but that
which is truly good and pure from all vice, as Calvin himself confesses,
Just. l. 3. c. 12.. 1.

Answ. As God has made two covenants with men, the one of works the other of
grace: so himself may be considered, either as a severe judge, judging
according to the Law, which is the covenant of works, beholding men as they
are in themselves: or, as a merciful father in Christ, dealing with us
according to the covenant of Grace, ^eholding us in his beloved. As he is a
Judge judging according to the Law, no obedience can satisfy or please him,
but that which is pure and perfect, as Calvin truly says. As he is the
father of the faithful in Christ, judging according to the covenant of Grace,
he deals with us as a loving father with his children, Malach. 3. 17. Psalm.
103. 13. accepting the upright, though weak and unperfect* endeavors of his
children, in lieu of perfect performance. Hence in the Scriptures to be
upright, or, to walk with God, is to please God, Genesis 5. 24, cum Heb. 11. 5.
and they, who are upright are his delight, Pro. 11. 20. Not, that either they,
or, their actions are perfect, or accepted of God in and for themselves, as
being pure from sin; but that being covered with the righteousness of
Christ, they are accepted 1 Pet. 2. 5.
in him: and not only accepted, but also graciously rewarded. Then belike
says Bellarmine, the righteousness of Christ is imputed not only to the
sinners themselves, but to their sins also making them an acceptable
sacrifice to God. Answ. We speak not of the sins of the faithful, as he
maliciously cavilleth, as if we made no difference betwixt their good works
and their sins; but of their good works, which, though unperfect and stained
with the flesh, the Lord accepts in Christ, as truly good, not imputing to
the faithful their wants, but covering them with the perfect obedience of
Christ.

. IX. His eighth testimony is from those places which absolutely call Testimony
8. from those places which call the works of the faithful good works.
the works of the righteous, good works, as Mat. 5. 16. 1 Timothy 6. 17. Tit. 3.
8. Ephesians. 2. 10.

Answ. where he says that the works of the faithful are called absolutely
good works, there is an ambiguity to be cleared. For though the Scriptures
absolutely call the works of the righteous good works: yet they do not say
that they* are absolutely good. All good works and virtues being considered in
the abstract, as they are in themselves according to their kind, and as they
are prescribed in the word of God, are absolutely good: but considered, as it
were in the concrete, as they be in us, or, performed by us, mixed with
imperfections, and stained with the flesh, they are not absolutely, purely, and
perfectly good. Prayer in it self, and ^s it is prescribed in the word of God,
is a work absolutely good: but as it is performed by us, it may be truly
good, if performed in truth, and with an upright heart; but it is not
absolutely and purely good, by reason of those imperfections which concur
there. with. So faith and love, and all other graces considered in the
abstract, are absolutely good, but considered as they be in us, they are
truly, but not purely and absolutely good by reason of the impersections and
defects which always accompany them,

But says Bellarmine out of Dionysi^s Areopagita, that work is to be called
evil, in which there is any defect: but it is not to be called good, unless
it be entirely and wholly good: which is true according to the rigor of the
Law, from which our Savior Christ has freed the faithful: and in that sense
all the good works of the Papists themselves, even their prayers in which they
so much trust, are sins. Or, if they deny any defect to be in their prayers,
or, other their supposed good works, they speak lies in hypoc^isie, 1 Timothy 4.
2.
having cauterized consciences. But here again let the Reader observe the
desperate doctrine of the Papists; who as they account no man justified in whom
there is any sin, so they teach all works to be absolutely sins, in which
is any defect: whereupon the accusation which they falsely lay to our charge,
will be verified of them, viz. that all the best works of the faithful are
sins. For we deny them to be sins though they have some defects; but they
affirm them absolutely to be sins, if there be any defect in them, as
undoubtedly there always is, as I have alr^ady proved. De iustif. l. 4. c. 1^
Testimonies of Fathers.


. X. These were his testimonies of holy Scriptures: in the next place he
produces other witnesses, viz. Ambrose, Hierome, Aug^stine, Gregory and
Bernard: who testify nothing against our assertion, but against the malicious
misconceit of the Papists, who conceive, or, at least report of us, that we
put no difference betwixt good works and sins. From which we are so far,
that we willingly, subscribe to that conclusion, which he would prove out of
the fathers, and is the title of his chapter, Opera bona non esse peccata, sed
vere bona, that good works are not sins, but truly good.

. XI. Now follow his reasons; which if they served to prove no De iustif. l 4.
c. 17 Reasons, first the works of the just are not conteminated.
more, than the same question, which again, is propounded to be proved, we
would not gain say. But his first reason is brought to prove, that the good
works of the righteous are no way vitiated, corrupted, or defiled: and
consequently that they are not only truly, but also purely Not with
concupiscence.
good. For if they were contaminated, says he, that would arise, either from
our inbred concupiscence; or, from the defect of love toward God, or, from the
mixture of venial sins concurring with them. But from none of these. For
neither is that concupiscence a sin in the regenerat^, nor is the want of the
love of God a sin in them, nor venial sins such sins, as are contrary to
the Law of God, or unto charity.

Thus, for the confirmation of one error Bellarmin^ broacheth three more. But
if concupiscence be a sin, if the want of Gods love be a sin, if those,
which the Papists call venial sins, be sins indeed: then must it be
confessed, that the good works which are stained with the flesh, which proceed
from a defective love of God and our brethren that are mixed with diverse
imperfections and corruptions, are notpurely good.

. XII. As for concupiscence of the flesh, which remains in the Concupiscence
in the regenerate a sin.
regenerate, it has possessed and defiled all the parts and faculties of the
soul, which as they are in the regenerate partly spirit, so they are also
partly flesh. And these two are opposite one to the other, the Spirit lusting
against the Flesh, and the Flesh lusting against the Spirit. So that though
Will be present with us, Romans 7. 18. Gal. 5. 17.
that we cannot do what we would and much less after what manner we would,
that is, with our whole souls, with our whole mind, heart, and affections. For
what good we mind or will as we are Spirit, the same we will as we are
Flesh. This concupiscence the Apostle had not known Romans 7. 7.
to be a sin, had not the Law said, non concupisces, that is, thou shall
have none evil concupiscence, neither habitual nor actual. Neither is it
only a sin, as the Apostle oftentimes does call it, but also it is the
mother-sinne, Iam. 1. 13 Romans 7. 17. which taking occasion by the Law, to
produce ill concupiscences therein forbidden, is convinced, not only to be a
sin, but exceedingly sinful, Romans 7. 13. But of this I have spoken before,
and proved by the testimony of Augustine, that concupiscence against which the
good Spirit lusts, (viz. in the regenerate, for in the unregenerate the
Spirit is not) is both a sin, and the cause of sin, and a punishment sin.
Secondly, nor with want of charity.


. XIII. And as touching the second: the sum of the Law is, that we should
love God with all our heart, and with all our soul, etc. but where is any
defect of love, there God is not loved with all the heart, etc. it being
legally understood: and therefore every defect is an aberration from the Law,
and consequently a sin. I have also proved out of Augustine, Epist. 29. illud
quod minus est qudm debet exvitio est.
that it is a fault where love is less than it ought to be, from which fault
it is, that there is not a righteous man upon earth which does good, and
sins not. For which also though we 1 De persect iustie. resp. adul.
Peccatumest, vel cum non est charitas quae esse debetvel minor est quam debet,
sive hocvoluntate vitari possit sive non possit. Thirdly, nor with venial
sins.
be never so good proficients, we must of necessity say, forgive us our
debts. Therefore every defect is a debt, that is, a sin, whereunto we may
add that of the same Augustine. It is a sin, either when there is not
charity where it ought to be, or is less than it ought to be, whether this
may or may not be avoided by the Will.

. XIV. And as to the third: If those, which the Papists call venial sins be
not contrary to the Law, then they are not forbidden in the Law: and without
doubt they are not commanded therein. Now if neither they be commanded nor
forbidden, then they are things indifferent:. but that is absurd: yea but
(says he) venial sins hinder not justice, And the Scripture absolutely
calls some men just and perfect, notwithstanding their venial sins. I
answer, they hinder not imputative justice, nor evangelicall perfection which
is uprightenesse: for to them that believe and repent they are not imputed.
Neither can it be denied, but that the most upright men have their
imperfections, infirmities and slippes, which though in themselves and
according to the Law are mortal sins (for if they should not be forgiven,
they would, as Bellarmine himself confesses, exclude men from heaven:) yet to
them that are in Christ Jesus they become venial by the mercy of God, through
the merits and intercession of Christ.

. XV. His second reason is taken from diverse absurdities, which His second
reason, from six absurdities which he puts upon us.
he conceives do follow upon our assertion: when as indeed they follow not
upon our doctrine, but upon his malicious misconceiving and misreport thereof;
as if we held, that all, even the best works of the righteous are mortal
sins. But we acknowledge, that the good works of men regenerate are truly
good, and so to be called, notwithstanding the imperfection thereof. Only we
deny them to be purely good: wherein we have the consent of holy Scriptures and
of the ancient Fathers, some whereof I before alleged, to whom I added Gregory
and Bernard. Gregory in the concl^sion of his Moralls says thus, Mala nostra
Moral. l 35. c. 26.
pura mala sunt, and bona quae nos habere credimus, pura bona esse uequaqua^
possunt: Our evil things are purely evil, and the good things which we
Deve^bis Esaiae sermon. 5. recta for sitan sed in pura.
suppose our selves to have, can by no means be purely good. Bernard, t Our
lowly justice (if we have any,) is perhaps true, but not pure. Unless
peradventure we believe our selves to be better than our forefathers, who
said no less truly, than humbly, all our righteousnesses are as it were the
cloth of a menstruous woman; we do not say that the good works of the
faithful are sins, and much less mortal sins: For we hold, that the sins of
the faithful become to them venial. But this we say with Solomon, Eccl. 7. 20.
that there is not a righteous man upon earth that does good and sins not,
which in effect is the same with that assertion of Luther, Iustus in omni opere
bono peccat.

. XVI. Now let us examine the absurdities, which he absurdly, The second
absurdity that then the work of faith, and of pray er were a sin.
upon his own malicious misconceit, objecteth against us. In all which it is
supposed, that we call the good works of the righteous sins, yea mortal
sins. The first: if all the works of the faithful be sins, then the
work of faith, whereby we are justified, and that prayer whereby we beg
remission of sin, should be sins.

Answ. The work of faith and the act of prayer are good, but not Sec^nd absurd.
purely and perfectly good. Neither are we justified by the worthiness or by
the work of our faith, but by the Object which it does receive; nor obtain
our desires by the merit of our prayer, but by the mediation and intercession
of Christ our Savior. Our faith is such, that we have need always to pray,
Lord increase our faith, Lord I believe, help mine unbeleefe: and our prayer
such, that when we have performed it in the best manner we can, we have need
to pray, that the wants and imperfections of our prayer may be forgiven us.

. XVII. The second: If all the works of the righteous be sins, with what face
could the Apostle say, 1 Cor. 4. 4.
that h^ knew nothing by himself? And what boldness was that, for his good
works, that is, for his mortal sins, to expect 2 Timothy 4. 8.
a Crown of righteousness? Answ. Though the Apostle had no doubt sometimes
offended after his conversion; yet he was not conscious to himself in
particular of any actual sin or crime committed by him: for as the Psalmist
says, Psalm. 19. 13.
who can understand his errors? No man, says Basil, (...)
is (...), free from sin but God; for of those many things wherein we offend,
the most we understand not: for which cause the Apostle says, I know nothing
by my self, but in that I am not justified: (...) that is, in many things I
offend, and doc not perceive whence also the Prophet says, who understands
his trespasses? But though he was not conscious to himself of his slippes and
oversights; yet he was not ignorent of his own Romans 7. 24.
corruptious and infirmities: against which when he had prayed to God, he
received this answer; ^ Cor. 12. 9.
My grace is sufficient for thee, and in weakness my power is made perfect.
Neither did the Apostle expect the reward for the merit of his works, but for
the truth and fidelity of God, who is just in keeping his promise made to the
upright, though unperfect indeavers of his servants. And therefore the reward,
whereby God does crown his own gifts in us, is called a crown of
righteousness, not of ours, but of Gods righteousness, as De gratia and lib.
arbit. in fine. The third absurdity.
Bernard says.

. XVIII. The third: If all the works of the righteous were mortal sins, then
God himself should sin mortally, because it is God that works in us, when
we do any good works, Phil. 1. and 2. Answ. If all good works were absolutely
sins, yea mortal sins, as they maliciously charge us to hold: then indeed,
God, who is the author of them, might perhaps be said, though not to sin,
and much less to sin mortally (for he is not subject to the precept of the
Law and much less to the curse of it) yet to be the author of sin. But we
hold, that the good works of the faithful are truly good, though not purely
good: and that what goodness is in them is the work of God, and what impurity
is in them, it is from the flesh, which staineth the works of grace in us.
Neither are the defects of the secondary causes to be imputed to the first
cause. That which God works in us, no doubt is good, but this good work he
has but begun in us, as in the place by him quoted, Philippians 1. 6. for our
in regeneration we are not wholly renewed, and at once, for then we should
be wholly spirit and no flesh. Neither does the leaven of grace season the
whole lump at once, but the inward 2 Cor. 4. 16.
man is renewed day by day: And what is not yet renewed is a remainer of the old
man, and what is not Spirit, is flesh. Now between these two there is a
perpetual conflict, Gal. 5. 17.
the spirit lusting against the flesh, and the flesh lusting against the
Spirit. So that a man regenerate cannot with full consent of will do either
good or evil, there being a reluctation of the Spirit against the evil, which
the flesh affects; and a re^luctation of the flesh against that good, which
is willed by the Spirit. By reason of this conflict it comes to pass, that as
the sins of the faithful are sins of infirmity more or less, and not
wilful sins committed of mere malice: so the good works of the The fourth
absurdity.
faithful are not purely good, but stained with the flesh.

. XIX. The 4. that our assertion is greatly injurious to our Redeemer, who as
the Apostle says, gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
iniquity, and might purge unto himself an acceptable people, zealous of
goodworks: For neither should he truly have redeemed us from any iniquity, nor
truly cleansed his people, nor made them zealous of works truly good, but of
mortal sins, namely if all their good works be mortal sins, (which we
utterly deny)

But I answer, Our Savior Christ gave himself for us, both that he might
justify us by redeeming us from all iniquity, and also that he might
sanctify, or as the Apostle speaks, that he might purify unto himself a
peculiar people, zealous or studious of good works. The iniquity from which he
redeemeth us, is not only of those transgressions, which are absolutely
sins, but also of those unperfect and defective works, which we endeavor to
perform in obedience to God. And herein, as I have said, the high Priest was a
notable type of our Savior Christ, who did wear in the forefront of his Miter
a plate of gold, in which was engraven this inscription Exodus 28 36. 38.
Holiness of the Lord, meaning of Ier. 23. 6.
Jehovah our righteousness, which he was appointed to wear, that he might
bear the iniquity of the holy things, which the Children of Israel should
hallow in all their holy gifts, that notwithstanding the iniquity of them they
might be accepted before the Lord, by imputation of his holiness, who is
Jehovah our righteousness. And the like is to be said of the incense Apoc. 8.
3. 4.
of the Saints upon earth, that is, of their prayers, and all other their good
works: which have need to be perfumed with the odours Ephesians. 5. 2.
of Christ's sacrifice; that so being defective in themselves, they may be
accepted 1 Pet. 2. 5.
of God in Christ. As for our sanctification, it is true, that Christ gave
himself to sanctify us. But this sanctification is but begun, and in part in
this life, and is to be perfected in the life to come. So says the Apostle,
Ephesians. 5. 25, 26, 27.
Ephcs. 5. that Christ loved his Church and gave himself for it, that he
might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of water by the word, that he
might present it to himself ( viz. at the marriage of the Lamb) a glorious
Church, not having spot or wrinckle or any such thing, but that it should be
holy and without blemish: which last words, as I have showed out of Augustine,
are to be understood not of the Church militant on earth, but of the Church
triumphant in heaven. The works, which we are to be studious of, are works
not only truly, but also, as much as is possible, purely good. For though we
cannot in this life attain to full purity and perfection: yet we must aspire
toward it, affecting and desiring to perform good works in a better manner
and measure, than we can indeed attain unto. Howbeit we must say with the
Romans 7. 18.
Apostle to will is present with me, but how to perform that which is good, I
find not, for the good that I would, I do not, but the evil which I would
not, that I do, and lest it should be said, that the Apostle speaks all
these things in the perof a carnal man, he concludes thus: so then (...),
even I my self, with the mind, that is, the Spirit serve the Law of God, but
with the flesh the Law of sin.

. XX. The fifth, If all good works are mortal sins, then some mortal The
fifth absurdity.
sins are good works: and then we may conclude thus. All good works are to be
done: some mortal sins are good works; therefore some mortal sins are to
be done. Again, no mortal sin is to be done; all good works are mortal
sins; therefore no good work is to be done. Conclusions worthy of the
Lutherans, that some mortal sins are to be done, and that no good work is
to be done. Answ. we deny good works to be mortal sins. though in every
good work the most righteous do sin. The work it self is good, though the
defect or imperfection, which goes with it, is evil. The good work therefore
is to be done: the defect we are to strive and to pray against, and to crave
pardon for it. To which deprecation we are to expect this answer or the like,
My 2 Cor. 12. 9.
grace is sufficient for thee, and in thy weakness my power is perfected.
Again, we must distinguish betwixt works, which are sins absolutely and
per se: and those which are only by accident. For those which are good per se,
are to be performed as well as we can, because commanded, knowing that God will
accept of our upright though weak endeavor. The sixth absurdity.


. XXI. The sixth and the last, who sees not, that these words, good works are
mortal sins, imply a contradiction, for they shall be good and not good, etc.

Answ. We do not affirm that good works are mortal sins, neither do we
deny them to be truly good. Only we deny them to be purely and perfectly
good. And we acknowledge the impurity and imperfection concurring with them to
be a sin: and consequently, that the good works of the faithful are good
per se, as being commanded, as being the fruits of the Spirit, and of faith
working by love; but sinful per accidens, as being stained with the flesh,
yea, but says Bellarmine, Bonum non existit nisi ex integra causa, malum vero
ex quolibet vitio: that is, that is not to be accounted a good work whereunto
all things do not concur which are requisite, but that is evil wherein
there is any defect: therefore if there be any defect or imperfection to be
found in any work, that work is not to be accounted good but evil. Answ.
that rule of Diony sius, is true, according to the rigor of the Law, which
they call (...) from which our Savior has delivered us; but it is not true
according to the covenant of grace, wherein the Lord accepts the sincere and
upright indevours of his children. though defective and unperfect, for perfect
performance, their wants being not imputed unto them, but covered with the robe
of Christ's perfect righteousness. As therefore their persons, though in
themselves sinners, are in 2 Cor. 5. 21.
Christ accepted as righteous; so their actions, though in themselves
defective, are acceptable 1 Pet. 2. 5.
in Christ. Here therefore we may justly retort both the accusation it self,
and all these absurdities upon the Papists, who be necessary consequence are
proved to hold, that all the works of the righteous are simply evil and so
absolutely to be called sins.

Those works wherein is found any defect or imperfection are not good, but
absolutely they are to be called sins, as the Papists teach:

But in all even the best works of the righteous there is to be found some
defect, imperfection, or blemish, as being stained with the flesh. This
assumption is plainly taught in the holy Scriptures as I have proved
heretofore:

Therefore all, even the best actions of the righteous, are absolutely to be
called sins, as the Papists teach.

Here then let all men again take notice of the Popish pharisaisme, or
pharisaicall hypocrisy of Papists, with whom no man is just or justified, in
whom is any sin: no action good, but simply evil, in which is any defect:
and yet their persons are just, and their actions not only good, but also
meritorious, and that ex condigno, and that ratione operis, of eternal life.

CHAP. V. Our fourth Argument, that the righteousness by which we are
justified, satisfies the Law: so does Christ's righteousness, so does not
that, which is inherent in us.
. I. NOw I return to our own proofs. The fourth The fourth argument we are
justified only by that righteousness which fully satisfies the Law of God.
argument therefore to prove jointly that we are justified by Christ's
righteousness and not by ours, may be this.

By that righteousness alone and by no other we are justified by which the Law
is fully satisfied; By the righteousness of Christ alone the Law is fully
satisfied, and not by any righteousness inherent in us or performed by us:

Therefore we are justified by the righteousness of Christ alone, and not by
any righteousness inherent in us, or performed by us.

For the proof of the proposition, three things are to be acknowledged: first,
that whosoever is justified is made just, by some righteousness: for as I have
showed heretofore, to think that a man should be justified without justice, is
as absurd, as to imagine a man to be clothed without apparel: secondly, that
all true righteousness is a conformity to the law of God, which is the perfect
rule of righteousness, insomuch as what is not conformable to the Law, is
(...), that is iniquity and sin: thirdly, that there can be no justification
without the Law be fulfilled, either by our selves, or by another for us. For
our Savior, when he came to justify us and save us, protested, that he came
not to break the Law but to fulfill it: and professes that not one jot or
tittle of the Law should pass unfulfilled, Matthew. 5. 17, 18. Saint Paul
likewise avoucheth, that by the doctrine of justification by faith, the Law is
not made void, but established, Romans 3. 31. The proposition therefore is
undeniable. The assumption has two parts: the former, affirmative, that by the
righteousness of Christ the Law is fully satisfied: the other, negative, that
by any righteousness inherent in us, or performed by us, the Law neither is,
nor can be fully satisfied. For the clearing of the assumption in both the
parts, we are to understand, that to the full satisfying of the Law, since the
fall of Adam two things are required, the one, in respect of the penalty, unto
the suffering whereof sin has made us debtours: the other, in respect of the
precept, to the doing whereof the Law does bind us. The former, to free us from
hell and damnation; the other to entitle us to heaven and salvation: according
to the sanction of the Law, If thou do not that which is commanded, thou art
accursed: if thoudoest it, thou shall be saved. In respect of the former, the
Law cannot be satisfied in the behalf of him, who has oncetransgressed it, but
by eternal punishment, or, that which is equivalent: in respect of the latter,
it is not satisfied, but by a total, perfect and perpetual obedience.

. II. Now our Savior Christ has fully satisfied the Law for all The
righteousness of Christ has fully satisfied the Law for us.
them that truly believe in him, in both respects. For he has superabundantly
satisfied the penalty of the Law for us by his sufferings and by his death: and
he has perfectly fulfilled the Law for us, by performing all righteousness,
in obeying his Father in all things, even unto death: and by them both he has
justified us, freeing us from hell by his sufferings and entituling of us unto
heaven by his obedience. And therefore the holy Ghost affirms that we are
justified by his blood, Romans 5. 9. and by his obedience verse 19. For his
sufferings were the sufferings of God; in which respect, they who put him to
death, are said to have killed the Author of life, Act. 3. 15. and to have
crucified the Lord of glory, 1 Cor. 2. 8 and for the same cause, the blood, by
which we are redeemed, is called the blood of God, Act. 20. 28. or, which is
all one, the blood of the Son of God. 1 John 17. His obedience likewise was
the obedience of God. For Jesus Christ the word, that is, the 1 John 3. 16.
second person in Trinity, being in the form of God P^il. 2. 6, 7, 8.
God coequall with his Father, for our sakes became flesh, Io^n. 1. 14.
that is, abased himself to become man, which before he was not, but not
ceasing to be that, which he was before, namely the true 1 John 5. 20.
and the great Tit. 2* 13.
God, God Romans 9* 5.
above all blessed for evermore; in our nature (being perfect God, and perfect
man) he farther humbled himself and became obedient until death, even to the
death of the cros^e. And therefore the righteousness of Christ, both habitual
inherent in his person, and that which was performed by him, both active, and
passive, being the righteousness of God as it is often called, Romans cap. 1. 3.
10. the righteousness of God and our Savior, 2 Pet. 1. 1. who was given to us
of God to be our righteousness 1 Cor. 1. 30. that we believing in him might
be the righteousness of God in him, 2 Cor. 5. 21 is therefore called Jehovah
our righteousuesse, Ier, 23. 6. I say his passive righteousness being the
righteousness of God the blood of God* it is a price of infinite value, and
superabundantly sufficient to satisfy for the sins, not only of the
faithful, but of all the world; and not only of this one world, but of more,
if there were more And this habitual and actual righteousness being the
righteousness and obedience of God, is of infinite and al^-sufficient merit to
entitle all those, that believe in him, were they never so many, to the
kingdom of heaven. These things if the Papists should deny, It would deny them
to be Christians. The former part therefore of the assumption is of undoubted
truth.

. III. Come we then to the other part. Is there any righteousness inherent in
us, or performed by us, that can fully satisfy the Our righteousness cannot
satisfy the Law neither in respect of the penalty.
Law? Nothing less. For first in respect of the penalty which is due unto us
for our sins, we cannot possibly fatisfie it, but by enduring everlasting
torment; which though we should endure for a million of millions of years;
yet we could not be said to have satisfied the Law which cannot be satisfied,
but by endless punishment, or, that which is equivalent, but there is nothing
equivalent but the precious death and sufferings of the eternal Son of God,
who gave himself to be (...) 1 Timothy 2. 6.
a full price of ransom countervailing, in respect of the dignity of his
person, the eternal pains of hell, which all the elect should have suffered.
Therefore there is no possibility for us to escape hell the just guerdon of our
sins, unless the Lord impute our si^s to our Savior Christ, and his
sufferings to us, accepting them in our behalf, as if we had sustained them in
our own persons. For although we should for the time to come perform a
total and perfect obedience to the Law, yet that would not free us from the
punishment already deserved by us. Marcus Eremit. de ^is quid ex operibus se
justificari putan^es. sent. 42. Si quo (...) que, bona natura (...) (...),
quotiaie (...) (...), quid reliqum pro an (...) (...) D^oretrionemus and sent.
43. quantum vir^utis augmentum body fecerimus, (...) negligentia argumentum
est, non conpensatio.
But the Law must be satisfied, both in respect of the penalty to be borne, and
in respect of perpetual and perfect obedience to be performed through out our
whole life. Neither may we think by the payment of one debt to satisfy
another, The obedience, which we hope to perform for the time to come, though
it were total and perfect, is a debt and duty which we owe unto God, Luke 17.
10. and therefore cannot discharge us of the penalty, which is another debt,
which we owe for our sins past: for we were sinners from the womb, Psalm.
51. 5.
yea, in the womb: and to the guilt of Adams transgression in whom we sinned,
and to that original corruption, which we have received from him, for which
though we had no other sins, we were worthily subject to eternal
damnation; we have added in the former part of our life innumerable personal
transgressions, all deserving death and damnation, which if we be not
delivered therefrom, by the death and merits of Christ, we must make account
to suffer in our own persons: neither can our future intended obedience
satisfy for our sins, as Bellarmine confesses. God is just Romans 3. 26.
in forgiving sins, neither does he forgive any sin, for which his justice
is not fully satisfied. Nor in respect of the precept.


. IV. Neither can our righteousnes^e ^atisfie the Law in respect of the
precept, by fulfilling it: for whosoever has not continued in all the things,
which are written in the book of the Law to do them, but has at any time
transgressed the Law, he has not fulfilled it. Therefore it is most certain,
that, we cannot satisfy the Law in respect of the precept, because we have
already broken it, and by our breach of it have made our selves subject to the
curse of the Law, so far are we from being justified by it. Neither are we
able by our obedience to satisfy the Law for the time to come.

, V. Against this branch of our argument which by us is added Bellarmines
allegation, that the Law may be fulfilled.
(...) as over measure. Bellarmine takes exception; alleging, that the
faithful and regenerate are able to fulfill De iustif. l. 4. c. 11, etc.
the Law, and enters into a large dispute to prove that the Law is possible:
which disputation I have fully examined in his due Lib. 7. cap. 6. and 7.
place, and confuted. Here let the Reader take notice, that Bellarmine
disputes sophistically in diverse respects* for first he will needs be actor,
when indeed he is reus; and that he might get the better end of the staff
pretends to confute our errors: when indeed he labors to defend his own.
Secondly, he answers but a piece of our argument, and such a piece as might
be spared, as being added mantisae loco, by way of advantage: for thus we
reason, no man can satisfy the Law because he has already broken it: yea he
is so far from satisfying the Law, in respect of the time past, that for the
time to come he is not able to fulfill it. Thirdly, where he should prove,
that all those, who are to be justified, do fulfill the Law for else how
should they by fulfilling of the Law be justified, all, that he endeavors to
prove, is, that it is possible for them that are already justified to fulfill
it* disputing, as we say, a posse ad esse. Fourthly, where he should prove,
that all who are justified do fulfill the Law, for else how should they be
justified by fulfilling it, he endeavors to prove that some rare men have
fulfilled it not caring what becomes of the rest Fifthly, where he argues,
that if men shall fulfill the Law, they shall be justified; his consequence
does not hold in respect of them, who at any time heretofore have broken it (as
all mere men without exception have done) though they should perfectly fulfill
the Law for the time to come. Sixthly, he would prove, that some do fulfill
the Law, and yet cannot deny, but that even those some do sin many times,
yea seven times a day, and that they have need daily to pray for the
forgiveness of their sins: and therefore fails in the proof of that also,
as I have made manifest in answering Lib. 7. cap. 6. and 7.
his arguments. Six reasons, that men are not able to fulfill the Law. First,
because all are trans. gressours.


. VI. Now to make good this part of our reason, I will not content my self to
have answered elsewhere all his objections againstit, but I will here also
briefly propound some of our arguments to prove, that we (I mean all mortal
men) neither do, nor can by our righteousness and obedience fulfill, and so
even in that respect cannot satisfy the Law. And first I prove it by this most
plain reason.

No transgressors of the Law do fulfill it.

All men without exception of any but Christ, are transgressors of the Law,
not only the unregenerate, but the regenerate also:

Therefore no man whatsoever (Christ excepted) does fulfill it.

The proposition needs no proof, the assumption I have proved before, Lib.
4. cap. 2.. 6.
and every man's Conscience gives testimony to it for himself.

Or thus:

Whosoever is a fulfiller of the Law is without sin.

No mortal man is or can be without sin.

Therefore no mortal man is or can be a fulfiller of the Law.

. VII. Secondly, If any man could fulfill the Law, he might be justified
thereby, Romans 2. 13. Gal. 3. 12.

But no man whatsoever can be justified by the Law, Gal. 2. 16. 3. 10, 11. Romans
3. 20.

Therefore no man can fulfill it.

. VIII. Thirdly, Those who cannot fulfill the first commandment of the two,
and the last of the ten, cannot fulfill the whole Law.

But no mortal man is able to fulfill the first and last commandments.

Therefore no mortal man is able to fulfill the whole Law.

The first* which is the great commandment, injoyneth us to love the Lord our
God with all our souls, etc. which, being legally understood, no mortal man
is able to fulfill. For whosoever are in all the parts and faculties of the
soul, partly flesh and but partly Spirit, they cannot love God with all their
souls.

The most regenerate in this life are partly flesh, and but partly Spirit in
all the parts and faculties of the soul.

Therefore the most regenerate in this life cannot love God with all their
souls, that phrase being legally understood.

The last commandment forbids all evil concupiscence: whether habitual,
with which all men generally are infected, or actual, from which none are
free, and those not such as are joined with consent of the will, which are
passions of lust, for those are forbidden in the former commandments; but such
as go before consent, which are called (...)* with which all men without
exception do abound. Neither is the commandment, thou shall not consent to
lust, but thou shall not lust, that is, thou shall have no evil concupiscence,
which as De persect. iustitiae.
Augustine says ought not to be bridled only Concupiscentia non (...) sed
omnino esse non debet. De Nupt. and concup. l. 1. c. 29. Multum b^ni facit qui
facit quod sc^iptum est, post concupi* scentias tuas non eas; sed non proficit,
quia non implet quod scriptum est, non concupisces.
but not to be: for he that has concupiscences, though he does not go after
them, does not fulfill the Law, thou shall not cove^.

. IX. Fourthly, by the testimony of Saint Peter, Act. 15. 10. that the
observation of the Law is not to be imposed upon Christians as necessary to
justification, as being a yoke, which neither the Apostles, nor their
forefathers the Patriarchs and Prophets were able to bear: but that we are to
be justified and saved by the grace of God through a lively faith* which
purifieth the heart. Bellarmine answers, that the Apostle speaks of the
ceremonial Law, which we do not altogether deny. But from hence we argue,
as from the less. If the ceremonial Law were an unsupportable yoke, how much
more the moral? For the ceremonial Law, in it self considered, was not
unsupportable, nor required any thing exceeding the power of man. For not only
the godly did perform it, but hypocrites also; who many times were more
precise in observing the ceremonies, than the godly themselves: but as it was
an appendice of the Law moral: As for example: Circumcision, in it self
(though the most painful ceremony) might well be borne. But as by it men
were made debtors Gal. 5. 3.
to the whole Law, in such sort as they could not be justified, but were under
the curse, if they did not observe the whole Law, it was a yoke unsupportable.
For in that sense the Apostle speaks, when he protests to the Galathians,
that if they were circumcised Gal. 5. 2.
Christ should profit them nothing. And in that sense, as it seems, it was
urged by the believing Act. 15. ^. 5.
Pharisees: that it was needful, that the disciples, meaning all the
Christians of that time, as well Gentiles, as Jews, should be circumcised,
and so required to keep the Law; otherwise they could not be justified nor
saved. And to that purpose tends Saint Peter's Act. 15. 7, 8, 9.
speech, That it was not needful to require the believing Gentiles to be
circumcised; seeing it was well known, that the Gentiles were first called by
his ministry, had truly believed, and had received the holy Ghost, who had
purified their hearts by a lively faith, by which without circumcision or other
observations of the Law they were justified, as well as the believing Jews:
the Jews also themselves expecting to be justified and saved by the grace of
the Lord Jesus Christ, even as the Gentiles were, without the works of the
Law, as Paul also reasons, Gal. 2. 15, 16.

. X. Fifthly, by the testimony of Saint Paul, and his experience in himself,
Romans 7. 18. etc. From whence I reason thus: whosoever are not able to perform
that which is good, though by the grace of God they are willing to perform it,
they are not able to fulfill the Law. But the faithful and regenerate are not
able to perform that which is good, though by the grace of God ^hey be willing
thereunto. Therefore they are not able to fulfill the Law.

The assumption is proved from the example of Saint Paul, as it were an
argument from the greater. For if Saint Paul himself, who in sanctity far
excelled any man now living, did not find in himself ability to perform that
which was good, but was so hindered by the flesh, that the good, which he
would, he did not: how sholl those, who are far inferior unto him, be able
to do it? being the common condition of all the regenerate, that by reason of
the reluctation of the flesh, they cannot do those things they would, Gal. 5.
17.

. XI. Sixthly, the Apostle Romans 8. 3. does acknowledge (...), the impossibility
of the Law, namely to justify us. The reason whereof is not any defect in the
Law it self, but our impotencie to fulfill it by reason of the flesh: for if
it were possible for us to fulfill the Law, it were possible to the Law to
justify us: but it is not possible to the Law to justify us by reason of the
flesh, and therefore by reason of the flesh it is not possible for us to
fulfill the Law, whiles the flesh remains in us, as it always does remain
even until death. To these arguments, if you shall add the testimonies of the
Fathers, which in handling the sixth question I do plentifully allege Lib. 7.
c. 6.
, you will acknowledge, that besides the authority of Scriptures, and evidence
of reason, we have the consent of antiquity, that no mortal man is able to
fulfill the Law of God.

CAP. VI. Our fift^ argument, containing four branches: By that w^e are
justified, by which we are absolved, redeemed, reconciled, and for which we
shall be saved.
. I. THe fifth argument. By what righteousness we are justified, The fifth
containing four branches which are so many arguments doubled.
by it we are absolved from our sins, redeemed from our iniquities,
reconciled unto God, and for it we shall be saved: And again by what
righteousness we are absolved, redeemed, reconciled, and for which we shall
be saved, by it we are justified.

By that righteousness which is inherent in our selves, we are not absolved
from our sins, nor redeemed from our iniquities, nor reconciled unto God, nor
for it shall be saved: But by the righteousness of Christ, which is out of us
in him, we are absolved from our sins, redeemed from our iniquities, etc.

Therefore we are not justified by that righteousness which is inherent in our
selves, but by that righteousness which is out of us in Christ.

The proposition in both the parts thereof contains four branches. The first
branch by what righteousness we are justified, by that we are absolved, etc.
The first, by what righteousness we are justified, we are by it absolved
from our sins: and a converso, by what righteousness we are absolved from
our sins, by that we are justified. This is proved from the signification of
the word justify, as being a judicial word opposed to condemnation, which I
have at large proved before Lib. 2.
. For this does invincibly demonstrate, that by what we are justified, by that
we are acquitted and absolved: and by what we are absolved, by that we are
justified. But more specially it may be proved out of Act. 13. 38, 39. where,
as I have showed before, not only the word justification and Act. 13. 38, 39.
remission of sins are promiscuously used, but the phrase also of being
justified from sin signifies plainly to be absolved from sin: where also
the maine question itself is concluded. Be it known unto you says S. Paul
to his brethren the Jews who feared Act. 13. 16. 26.
God, that through Jesus Christ is preached unto you forgiveness of sins.
And by him all that believe are justified from all those things (meaning
sins) from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses. From our
sins therefore we are justified or, absolved by the righteousness of Christ
apprehended by faith, from which we could out be acquitted by any obedience,
which we could perform to the Law.

. II. But of this place we are further to speak in defense of Calvin's
allegation thereof against Bellarmines cavils. Calvin, prooving that Calvin's
allegation of Act. 13. 38 39 def^nded against (...) cavils De justis l. 2 c.
12. in^titut. 3. c. 11.. 3.
God does justify us, when he absolveth us from our sins, and accepts of
us in Christ, alleges this place. Through this man, that is, Christ, is
preached unto you remission of sins, and by him all that believe are
justified from all things from which ye could not be justified by the Law of
Moses. You see, says Calvin, that justification is here set after remission of
sins by way of interpretation r you see plainly, that it is taken for
absolution: you see, that it is denied to the works of the Law: you see, it is
merely the benefit of Christ: you see, that it is received by faith: and
finally you see, that there is a satisfaction interposed, where he says, that
through Christ we are justified from our sins.

Bellarmine pretending to answer this argument, relates it thus, as if Calvin
had said; First, By this man, that is, by Christ we are justified, and not by
any virtues or qualities of ours: Secondly, is preached, that signifies, that
the very preaching or declaring of the promise, if it be apprehended by faith,
does justify, for so the Apostle presently expounds himself, by him every
one that believes is justified. Thirdly, forgiveness of sins: that
signifies that justification consists in nothing else, but in remission of
sins wherefore the inward renovation is not the other part of justication:
for that renovation is not so much justifica^ion, as an effect thereof. And
lastly, these words, from which ye could not be justified by the Law of Moses,
do signify, that justification does not consist in the observation of the
Law, but only, as has been said, in remission of sins for or through the
righteousness of Christ imputed, Thus, as you see, he makes Calvin speak
what he pleases. But because the things, which he inforceth in Calvin's name
upon this place, be for the most part our assertions, it shall not be amiss
to weigh the answers which he makes to them.

And first, where it is said per hunc, by this man, he says, this does First,
per hunc, by this man.
not exclude our virtues or qualities infused of God. For by Christ we are
justified as the efficient, which is signified by the preposition per: by
virtues and qualities infused, as the formal cause. Now if Christ or his
righteousness be the efficient cause, then it cannot be the formal cause;
for the form is the effect of the efficient; nor can the same thing be the
cause and effect of the same thing. Neither may they say as they are wont, that
this is a mystery of faith, that reason cannot attain unto. For mysteries
though they surmount reason, yet are notrepugnant to reason. Neither ought we
to feign mysteries (as the Papists use to do) where the Scriptures have an
easy and perspicuous meaning. R^ply. This were a good caveat to the papists.
As for us, we faineno such mysteries, neither do we say, that Christ or his
righteousness is both the efficient and formal cause of our justification.
But this we say, that the righteousness of Christ, is both the matter of our
justification, and also the merit both of our justification and salvation: and
that Christ himself as he is Mediator is the secondary efficient of our
justification, affording unto it both the matter thereof and the merit.
Secondly, is preached.


. IV. That word is preached does not signify, says he, that by the only
preaching of Scriptures apprehended by faith men are justified. For then Peter
would not have said, Act. 2. 38. Do pe^ance, and be every one of you baptized
for remission of sins. But it signifies, that remission of sins is
preached to all that believe in Christ, as they ought, that is, in doing
whatsoever he comma^deth to be done, according to that Mat. 28. 20. teaching
them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you. In this sense every
one that b^leeveth is justified, that is, whosoever believes as he ought,
namely by fulfilling all things, which faith does declare ought to be
fulfilled. For not he that believes a Physician, though he be never so
skillful, and one that infallibly cur^th, is healed, unless he receive such
medicines as he does appoint.

Reply. We do not say, that preaching alone apprehended by faith does
justify: but we say, that a true and a lively faith, which is begotten by the
preaching of the Word, does justify a man before God: and that, wicked is that
aphorisine collected out of Bellarmine Tom. 2. in indice. voc^ predicatio, Per
predicationem verbi Dei excitari fidem, and sic remitt^ peccata figmentum est
baeretico^um nostri t^m peris.
, that by the preaching of the Word of God faith is stirred up, and so sins
are forgiven, is a fiction of the heretics of our time. Nay, we say more, that
by the preaching of the Word, faith is not only excited, where it was before;
but that it is first wrought ordinarily, and begotten by the ministry of the
Gospel. The Papists ascribe the begetting of faith to the Sacraments, and the
stirring of it up to the Word. As if faith infused in Baptism did ly a sleep
until it be excited and awakned by the word, Romans 10. 17.
But the Scripture teaches us, that faith comes by hearing the Word, that
Preachers are Ministers by whom you do believe, that without 1 Cor. 3. 5.
a preacher men cannot ordinarily believe, Romans 10. 14. that men are begotten
to God by the preaching of the Word, 1 Cor. 4. 15. that therefore preachers are
their Fathers in the faith, that they justify men, Dan. 12. 3. because they
are the instruments of the holy Ghost to beget faith in them, whereby they are
justified. Why then does Peter require them to whom he had preached, to repent
and to be baptized? I answer, that the holy Ghost by Peter's sermon had wrought
the grace of faith in the hearers before they were baptized, Act. 2. 41. as by
Paul's preaching, Act. 13. 48. in so many of the hearers as were ordained unto
life, in Lydia, Act. 16. 14, 15. By Philips preaching in the Eunuch, Act. 8.
38. by Peter's preaching in Cornelius and his company, Act. 10. 43. 44. and by
this faith they were justified before God before they were baptized, even as
Abraham was before he was circumcised, Romans 4. 11. But that they might be
justified also in the Court of their own Conscience, and much more that they
might be saved; many other things, as repentance and a godly life, with the use
of the Sacraments, and of all other good means are required besides that
faith, whereby alone they are justified before God. And to this end did Peter
require them to repent and to be baptized: not that Baptism properly does
justify, and much less that it begets ^aith, for, in all these faith was
wrought before they were baptized, but because it is a seal of that
righteousness which is by faith to them that are baptized, not only at the
time of Baptism, but whenever or how long soever they believe. And whereas
he says, that remission of sins is preached to those that believe as they
ought: I confess it is true, that remission is not promised to an idle dead or
counterfeit faith, but to the true, lively and effectual faith, which in some
measure purifieth the heart, and works by love; causing a man, though not to
fulfill all things that are commanded, as Bellarmine speaks; yet to will, to
desire, and to endeavor that he may perform all things commanded, according
to the measure of grace received. But though obedience be a necessary
consequent of faith: yet it is very absurd to confound it with faith, as
Bellarmine here seems to do. The similitude (...) the Physi. (...).


. V. As for his similitude of the Physician, I answer: the only means to be
cured of the wounds of our souls, which are our sins, by our spiritual
Physician which is Christ, is to believe in him; and the only plasters to be
applied are his sufferings and merits: for by his stripes we are healed Esa.
53. 5. and the only means, on our part, to apply them is faith. For even as
Moses lifted up the brazen Serpent in the Wilderness, that those who were
bitten by the fiery serpents might by looking upon that, which was but a figure
(...). 3. 14, 15.
of Christ, be healed: even so our Savior Christ was lifted up upon the
Cross, that whosoever being stung, as we all are, by the old Serpent, and made
subject to e^all death, shall look upon him with the eye of a true faith,
shall be saved. To which remedy alone all true physicians of men's souls do
use to direct the wounded Conscience: when the Iaylour, Act. 16. 30, 31. in
great consternation of mind came trembling: and falling down before Paul and
Silas, demanded of them what he might do that he might be saved: they said
believe on the Lord Jesus Christ, and thou shall be saved. And this remedy ^in
curing miraculously corporal discases was used sometimes with good success,
Mat. 9. 21. 22. 14. 36. and was by our Savior himself prescribed as the only
receipt, Mar. 5. 36. Luke 8. 50.

. VI. Thirdly, where the Apostle in this place names only remission Thirdly,
remission of sins.
of sins, he says, it hinders not, but that just^fication may be
understood to consist in remission of sins, and infusion of righteousness.
For as we have not once showed says he, remission of sins is not only the
pard^ning of the punishment, but also the washing away and cleansing of the
fault, which is not done but by the cleanness of grace and comeliness of
justice coming in the place: which the name of justification pretends being
named from justice. Reply. Not once, but very often has he said, that remission
of sin is the utter deletion and extinction of sin, and that it is not a
distinct act from infusion of righteousness, because by infusion of justice
sin is expelled: as by the accession of heat and light cold and darkness is
expelled. But as for condonation and pardon of the guilt and punishment, that
he has utterly excluded from justification. For the pardoning of the guilt and
punishment is not done by infusion of righteousness, (which, as he teaches,
is the only act of justification, whereof there is but one formal cause,
which is righteousness insu^ed, as the Council of Trent (...). 6. c^p. 7.
has defined) but by imputation of the satisfaction of Christ. For
righteousness infused, De iustif. l. 2. cap. 10.
, as Bellarmine has confessed, does not, or cannot, satisfy for our sins.
Now if there be but. Deinde.
one formal cause of justification (as indeed there is but one) and that one
be not the imputation, but the infusion of justice, or, as they rather use to
speak, the justice infused, which expels sin, which expulsion or deletion
they call the remission, yea, the true remission of sin: then the
forgiveness of the guilt and punishment belongs not to justification. But if
the forgiving of the guilt and punishment, be the not imputing of sin, which
necessarily brings with it imputation of righteousness, as Bellarmine
confesses, and the Apostle proves, Romans 4. viz. that the Lord imputes
righteousness without works, when he imputes not sin: then it will
necessarily follow, that imputation of Christ's satisfaction or righteousness
is the only formal cause of justification; whereby, we being absolved from
sin are accepted as just, yea constituted righteous in Christ. And that
infusion of righteousness expelling sin, is another thing, which the
Scriptures call Sanctification. And this I take to be a manifest truth: which
being granted, we have obtained the whole cause.

. VII. Fourthly, again (says he) although there were mention made Fourthly,
justification from sinn^.
in this place of justification only from sins: yet in many other places
there is mention made of Sanctification, of cleansing, of washing, and
renewing, which show the other part of justification. Reply, we doubt not, but
the Scriptures make mention of both these benefits sometimes severally, and
sometimes jointly: which though in use and practice they always go together;
yet they must be carefully distinguished. And howsoever the Scriptures often
make mention of Sanctification, as well as of justification: yet no where do
they make Sanctification a part of justification. This Bellarmine should have
proved and not have craved. Neither is it to be doubted, but that if
forgiveness of the guilt and punishment concur unto justification as a part
thereof, renovation or infusion of righteousness being the other part as
Bellarmine here affirms, the^e are two actions and two formal causes of
justification, which themselves utterly deny. And therefore they must be
forced to acknowledge these two actions having distinct forms to be
justification, whose form is imputation and sanctification, whose form is
infusion of righteousness. Fifthly, by the Law.


. VIII. Finally says he, from which you could not be justified by the Law of
Moses, signifies, that the observation of the Law, neither by the strength of
nature, nor by help of the Law alone presumed, does justify: not because the
true observation of the Law is not righteousness, but because before remission
of sin, the Law cannot be kept. Reply, By the observation of Law is meant,
all obedience and righteousness inherent whatsoever prescribed in the Law,
whether it go before faith and justification, or follow after. For before, as
Bellarmine truly says, the Law cannot be fulfilled, neither can there be any
true righteousness. And that obedience, which is performed after, though it be
a righteousness begun in us, and be not only accepted in Christ, but also
graciously rewarded: yet it cannot satisfy for our former sins, nor justify
us from them. That, which Bellarmine adds, I admit with some small
qualification, as making for us. For God, says he, when by the merits of
Christ he reconcileth any man, he does withal forgive his sins, (so says
the Apostle 2 Cor. 5. 19. which is all one, as if Bellarmine had said, when God
justifies a man not imputing his sin, and accepting of him as righteous in
Christ) then he infuseth charity, by which he may keep the Law, which is all
one as if he had said, when God has justified a man he does also Sanctify
him. This, says he, is that which Saint Augustine so often repeateth (and
wholly makes for us) opera non pr^cedere justificandum, that works go not
before, (as causes of justification) sed sequi justificatum, but follow after
as effects and fruits thereof. And this Augustine speaks, not of such works
as perfectly fulfill the Commandments, for such there are none whiles they are
stained with the flesh: but of all good works, which notwithstanding their
defectivenesse, are accepted of God in Christ, that which he adds out of Romans
8. 4. I have discussed Lib. 7. c. 7.. 7. The four branches of the proposition
proved.
elsewhere.

. IX. But to return to the proof of my proposition: to that place of the
Acts, I add for the further proof of the first branch, Romans 4. verse. 5, 6, 7,
8. where the Apostle uses these words promiscuously, justification and
blessedness, and proves out of Psalm. 32. 1. that this blessedness consists
in remission of sin, or, as he also speaks, in the not imputing of sin, and
imputation of righteousness without works: from whence this is proved; by what
righteousness we have remission of sin, by that we are justified: and by
what we are justified we have remission of sin. The second branch; by what
righteousness we are redeemed, by that we are justified, and e converso, by
what we are justified, by that we are redeemed. The benefit of redemption is
explained by the Apostle, Ephesians. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14. to be remission of sin,
and expressed by the phrase of redeeming from all iniquttie, Tit. 2. 14. Psalm.
133. 8. The third branch, by what righteousness we are reconciled to God, by
it we are justified, and by what we are justified we are reconciled. The
Apostle Romans 5. 9, 10. uses these words promiscuously, to be justified by the
blood of Christ, and to be reconciled to God by the death of his Son, and 2
Cor 5. 19. God is said to reconcile men unto him in Christ, when he does not
impute untio them their sins, but imputes unto them righteousness, even the
righteousness of God, that is, of Christ, that they only may be made the
righteousness of God in him, verse. 21. The fourth branch: for what
righteousness we are saved, by that we are justified, and e converso: that
which is the matter of justification is the merit of salvation: for which cause
justification and to be justified is many times expressed, by salvation or to
be saved: for they that are justified are saved in hope Tit. 3. 7.
; and by what they are justified, by that they are entitled to salvation, and
by what we receive remission of sins, by that also we receive our Act. 26. 18.
inheritance. Justification may be compared to the institution of a Minister
unto a benefice which gives jus ad rem; glorification to induction which
gives possession, and jus in re.

. X. I come to the assumption: the first branch whereof is, that we The
assumption proved in all the four branches.
are absolved from our sins by the righteousness of Christ, and not by any
righteousness inherent in us^ both which are plainly averred, Act. 3. 38, 39.
The former also is every where testified: that the blood of Mat. 26. 28. Esai.
5. 3. 510, 11. 1 Ioh. 1. 7. Ephesians. 1. 7. Heb. 9. 14. Apoc. 1. 5. Romans 3. 25. 1 John 2. 2.
Christ was shed for the remission of sins, and that it does cleanse us from
all our sins, that he is the propitiation for our sins, etc. The latter is
also evident, that we cannot be absolved from our sins by righteousness
inherent: first, because it cannot satisfy for our sins: secondly, because
it cannot stand in judgment. If we should plead it before God, we could not
be justified thereby, Psalm. 143. 2. Neither are we able to answer him one of a
thousand, Io^ 9. 3. Thirdly, because our obedience, though it were total (as
it is never in this life) yet it were a debt and we cannot be absolved from one
debt, by the payment of another, when ye shall have done all things which are
commanded you, say, we are unprofitable servants: we have done that which was
our duty to do, Luke 17. 10. The second branch, that we are redeemed by the
merits of Christ, and not by our own righteousness, needs no proof,
neither in respect of the affirmative, that by his blood we have redemption

remission of our sins, that he gave himself 1 Timothy 2. 5.
to be (...), a full price of ransom to redeem us from all iniquity. Nor in
respect of the Negative; unless it may be thought, that we, who were held
captives under sin and Satan 2 Timothy 2. 26.
to do his will, could deliver our selves, which God does swear to be his
gift, Luke 1. 73, 74. Neither could we be delivered out of the hands of the
strong man, but by him Mat. 12. 29.
that is stronger than he. The third branch also is manifest, both in respect
of the affirmative, that we are reconciled unto God by the death of his Son,
Romans 5. 10. Col. 1. 21, 22, and also of the negative. For we were enemies, when
we were reconciled, and such enemies, as whatsoever we minded Genesis 6. 5.
was enmity against God, Romans 8. 7. Lastly, the fourth branch needs no
proof, neither in respect of the affirmative, unless it may be thought
needful to prove, that we are saved by the merits of Christ: nor in respect of
the negative, the Scriptures so often testifying that we are saved by grace
Ephesians. 2. 8, 9.
through faith, not by works, no not by any works of righteousness Tit. 3. 5.
that we have done. So much of this argument, which if I should strive for
number might stand for eight, four for the affirmative and four against the
negative.

CAP. VII. Containing six other arguments, proving jointly that we are
justified by Christ's righteousness, and not by ours.
. I.

THe sixth argument: The righteousness, by which we Arg. 6. by faith and not
by works.
are justified, is the righteousness of faith, and not of works, as Saint
Paul Romans 3. 20. 28. 4. 6.
constantly teaches.

The righteousness which is out of us in Christ is Gal 2. 16. Ephesians. 2. 8. 9.
Tit. 3. 5. 7.
the righteousness of faith; or the righteousness which we receive and have
by faith, or the righteousness of God by faith: The righteousness inherent is
of works. By that justice therefore we are justified, and not by this.

. 2. The seventh: The righteousness of God, by which we are justified, Arg 7.
righteousness of iustisication not prescribed in the Law.
is not prescribed in the Law to justification, but without the Law is revealed
in the Gospel, To. 1. 17. 3. 21.
Romans 3. 21.

The righteousness which is out of us in Christ was not prescribed in the Law
to justification, but without the Law is revealed in the Gospel:
righteousness inherent is prescribed in the Law to justification, which in the
question of justification is renounced in the doctrine Phil 3. 8, 9.
of the Gospel. This being the maine difference between the Law and the
Gospel, that the Law to justification requires perfect obedience to be
performed in our own persons: the Gospel propounds the obedience of Christ
which he performed for us, to be accepted in their behalf who believe in him.
Wherefore let him be held accursed, Gal. 1. 8, 9.
though he were an Apostle, though an Angel from heaven, who shall reach
justification by the legal righteousness, and not by the evangelicall.
Again, the Law was given as the Apostle Gal. 3. 17.
says four hundred and thirty years after the covenant of Grace, and promise
of justification by faith in Christ, was made to Abraham: and therefore cannot
disanull that covenant which was before confirmed in Christ, that it should
make the promise of none effect, which it would, if the promise of
justification were made upon condition of fulfilling the Law.

. III. Eighthly, By what righteousness we are justified, the justice Arg. 8 the
righteousness of justification satisfies Gods justice.
of God is fully satisfied. God being so merciful in forgiving sins that he
remains just, Romans 3. 25, 26. For though he proclaim himself Exodus 34. 7.
merciful and gracious, long-suffering and abundant in goodness and truth,
keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgression and sin: yet
he protests, that absolving he will not absolve, that is, by no means will
absolve such as ought not to be absolved, that is, such as for whom his justice
is not satisfied. Neither does he indeed forgive any sin, for which his
justice is not satisfied. But as every sin deserves death, so it is punished
with death, either with the death of the party, for whom he has no other
satisfaction: or with the death of Christ, who has satisfied the justice of
God for the sins of all that truly believe in him.

By the righteousness of Christ which is out of us in him, the justice of God
is fully satisfied (as Bellarmine himself proves, g and therefore professes
that in him he is well pleased. Finally, g De iustif. l. 2. c. 5.. 4 quarta
ratio.
says Bellarmine, Ibid.. at long.
Nothing more frequently does all the Scripture testify than that the passion
and death of Christ was a full and perfect Mat. 3. 17. 17. 5.
satisfaction for sins. He made the atonement Col. 1. 20 1 Ioh. 2. 2. Romans
3. 25. Ephesians. 5. 2.
between God and us, giving himself an offering and sacrifice to God, for a
sweet smelling savor.

But by that righteousness which it inherent in us, the justice of God is not
satisfied, as Deiustif. l. 2. ^. 10.. Deinde.
Bellarmine confesses. Therefore we are justified by the righteousness of
Christ, which is out us in him, and not by righteousness inherent in us.

And here I will make bold, with Bellarmine to borow a speech from him, (which
he borrowed as it seems from our Writers) to the confusion of himself and all
other Popish Iustitiaries. For where Osiander had argued, that God accepts
for a satisfaction no justice, but that which is infinite, and consequently
none but his own uncreated and essential righteousness, Bellarmine
answers: De iustif. l. 2. ^. 5. sine.
God indeed does not accept as a true satisfaction for sin, any justice, but
that which is infinite, because sin is an infinite offense. But that some
justice may be finite, that is, of infinite price and valor, it is not
necessary that it should be the essential justice of God, but it is sufficient
that it be the justice of an infinite person, such as Christ is, God and man.
Therefore the obedience, the passion and death of the Son of God, though in
it self and essentially it was a created justice and finite, notwithstanding
in regard of the person, who obeyed, suffered, and died, it was infinite, and
in the true rigor of justice it was a propitiation for our sins, and not for
our sins alone, but for the sins of the whole world. From whence I argue
thus, that justice, which is of infinite value, the Lord accepts as a true
satisfaction for sin, and that which is not of infinite value he does not
accept; for the offense of sin is infinite. But the righteousness of Christ
only is of infinite value, ours is not: therefore the Lord accepts Christ's
righteousness, and not ours, as a true satisfaction for sin.

. IV. Ninthly, they that cannot be justified without remission of sin, Arg. 9.
no man justified without remission of sin.
are justified neither by inherent righteousness, because they are sinners,
nor without the righteousness of Christ imputed; without which, as there can
be no satisfaction for sin, so no remission of sin.

But no man can be justified without remission of sin. Therefore no man is
justified by righteousness inherent, but only by the righteousness of Christ.

. V. The tenth, that is to be esteemed the true doctrine of justification, The
true doctrine of justification is comfortable.
which does minister sound comfort to the distressed conscience of the
faithful; and that falfe, which is a rack to the conscience of Gods children,
when they are humbled under the hand of God.

The doctrine of justification by the merits and obedience of Christ imputed,
ministers singular comfort to the distressed conscience of the faithful, even
in the agony of death: assuring the believing sinner, that howsoever the devil
accuses, the Law convicteth, the conscience confesses his demerits: yet
notwithstanding, if he truly believe in Christ, he shall be accepted of God as
righteous in Christ, and as an heir of eternal life; Christ's sufferings and
obedience being imputed unto him, and accepted of God in his behalf, as if he
had suffered and performed the same in his own person.

But the doctrine of justification by inherent righteousness, is, as it were,
a rack to men's consciences. For when a man being summoned to appear before
the judgment seat of God, shall seriously consider with himself, what he
shall oppose to the accusations of Satan, to the conviction of the Law, to the
Testimony of his own Conscience, confessing himself to be a most wretched
sinner, to the judgment of God, the most righteous judge: If he look back to
his own conversation, as having nothing to trust to, but his own
righteousness, he shall find sufficient matter of despair. He may say with
In libello de Miseria hominis.
Anselme, Terret me vita mea, etc. my life does terrify me: for being
diligently examined, my whole life almost appears either to be sin or
barrenness: and if there seem to be any fruit therein, it is either so
counterfeit, or unperfect, or some way or other corrupted, as that it can do
no other, but either not please, or displease God. And summoning himself
before the judgment seat of God, he finds himself to be in great straits.
On this side, says he, will be accusing sins, on that side terrifying
justice: under, will lie open the horrible gulf of hell; above, an angry
Judge; within, a burning conscience, without, a flaming world -- where shall I
be hid, how shall I appear? to be hid is impossible, to appear is
untolerable. To avoid these straits, there is no way but to renounce the
doctrine of justification by works or inherent righteousness, and to fly to the
doctrine of the Gospel teaching justification by the grace of God, freely
without respect of works through the merits of Christ received by faith: and to
appeal from the tribunal of Gods justice to the throne of his mercy. For
whiles a man retains this opinion, that he can be no otherwise justified
than by his own good works, or inherent righteousness, he can never be
soundly persuaded, that his righteousness is sufficient for that purpose, but
ever has just caufe not only of doubting but also of despair. And this is
the cause of that Popish opinion, that no man without special revelation can
be assured of the remission of his sins, or of salvation. Argument eleven
from experience.


. VI. The eleventh and last argument shall be taken from experience. For when
men seriously considering of their justification before God, as a judicial act
of God (as the word it self imports) shall sincerely, and in the fear of
God, set themselves before his judgment seat, where they must receive the
sentence either of absolution or condemnation; and shall bethink themselves,
what, they being accused of Satan, and convicted by the testimony of their own
Conscience, have to oppose to the just judgment of God, why sentence of
condemnation should not pass against them; they would utterly disclaim their
own righteousness. For as Augustine, and other of the Fathers observe, as
before I have noted, out of the eight and nine verses of Prove. 20. joined
together, cum Rex justus sederit in solio, quis potest dicere mundum est cor
meum, when the righteous King shall sit upon his throne, who can say, my heart
is clean? yea, the best of the Papists, when By deadly sicknes^e, as Gods
messenger, they have been summoned to come before Gods judgment, they have
been forced to leave their schoole-trickes, and sophistical distinctions; and
plainly renouncing their own righteousness, to rest wholly upon the mercies
of God and the merits of Christ. Insomuch that many who have lived Papists,
have in this most weighty point died reformed Catholics. And to this purpose
there is extant among them in diverse Books a form of visiting the Questiones

sick, wherein both the Pastor is directed what to say, and the sick person
is instructed what to answer. The Pastor therefore having demanded these
questions, Brother do thou rejoice that thou shall dye in the faith? do
thou confess that thou have not lived so well as thou ought? Does it repent
thee? have thou a will to amend, if thou hadd'st space of life? Do thou
believe that our Lord Jesus Christ dyed for thee? do thou believe that thou
can not be saved but by his death? and having received affirmative answers
to every question, he infers this exhortation; that whiles his soul
remains in him, he should place his whole affiance in the death of Christ,
and in no other thing: and that if God will judge him, if he shall say unto
him thou art a sinner, that thou have deserved damnation, that he is angry
with thee; he should say, O Lord I interpose the death of thy Son between me
and thy judgment, between my sins, and thee, between me and my bad
deserts, between me and thine anger. In the edition printed at Venice, Or do
baptizandi cum modo visit andi impress. venet^. an. 1575. fol. 34.
there are these two questions, do thou believe that thou shall come to glory
not by thine own merits but by the virtue and merit of Christ's passion? And a
little after, do thou believe that our Lord Jesus Christ died for our
Salvation, and that no man can be saved by his own merits, or by any other
means, but by the merit of his passion? unto both which an affirmative answer
was made: but both blotted out in the Index expurgatorius Impress. Madriti

CAP. VIII. The disproofe of the Popish assertion affirming, that we are not
justified by righteousness inherent.
. I. NOw we are severally to disprove the Popish assertion The disproofe of the
Negative.
and to prove ours. As touching the former, that we are not justified by
righteousness inherent. The first argument because inherent righteousness is
prescribed in the Law.
Our first argument may be this. That righteousness of God, by which we are
justified, is not prescribed in the Law, as before has been proved, Romans 3.
21. nor is that righteousness which is of the Law, Phil. 3. 9.

All inherent righteousness is prescribed in the Law, and is that which is of
the Law:

Therefore inherent righteousness is not that righteousness of God, by which
we are justified.

That all inherent righteousness is prescribed in the Law, it is manifest:
first, because the Law is a perfect rule of all inherent righteousness,
whether habitual or actual: secondly, because charity, wherein they place
their inherent righteousness, even that charity, whereby they are to love God
withal their souls, and their neighbor as themselves: that charity, which
proceeds from a pure heart, from a good conscience, and from faith unfeigned
is prescribed in the Law, as the sum and complement thereof, Matthew. 22. 37.
39, 40. 1 Timothy 1. 5.

. II. To avoid this most evident truth, Bellarmine brings a frivolous
Bellarmines distinction De iustif. l. 1 c. 19. between the justice of the Law
and in the Law.
distinction, as he applies it; to wit, that there is, justitia legis, and
justitia in lege or exlege: The justice of the Law, the justice in the Law or
of the Law. The justice of the Law is that very justice which the Law
prescribes, or that justice which is described in the Law, and is not rejected
by the Apostle but commended. That justice which is in, of, or by the Law, is
that, which men without faith and without grace do perform by the strength of
nature, only helped by the knowledge of the Law. And this, says he, the
Apostle does reject as unprofitable, and opposes it to the righteousness of
faith. h. e. says he, operibus bonis quae fiunt ex gratia and fide, that is,
to good works which are done by grace and by faith. So that justitia fidei,
the righteousness of faith, is now in Bellarmines divinity, become justi^ia
operum, the justice of works. In Romans 10. disput. 2.
Pererius to the same purpose brings a threefold distinction of justice, that
it is Legis, ex lege, and Dei: and inveigheth against Calvin, for that he took
no notice of it, being so plainly, as he says, taught by the Apostle, Romans
9. 31. 10. 3. 5.

. III. Answ. 1. This distinction cannot be collected out of the writings of
Saint Paul, who no where mentions (...), the Answer, refelling this
distinction of ^llarmine.
righteousness of the Law, and much less distinguishes it from that which is
of, in, or by the Law (though the vulgar Latin has justitias legis, where the
Greek is (...), To. 2. 26. and justificatio legis, Romans 8. 4. where the Greek
is, (...), but uses these terms to express our inherent righteousness,
(...), Romans 10. 5. Phil. 3. 9. or (...), Phil. 3. 6. that which is of, in, or
by the Law: which terms the righteousness of the Law, or that which is of,
in, or by the Law, do no more differ than (...), Romans 4. 13. (...), Romans 9.
30. 10. 6. (...), and (...), Phil. 3. 9. the righteousness of faith, or that
which is of, by or through faith. Secondly, the righteousness of the Law is
that, which the Law prescribes, as themselves define it: and what does that
differ from that, which is prescribed in the Law? Thirdly, of the
righteousness of the Law our Savior speaks, says Pererius, Matthew. 19. 17.
If thou will enter into life keep the commandments. Of that, which is of or
by the Law, Moses speaks that he which does those things (that are commanded)
shall live in them: betwixt which two speeches of Christ and Moses there is no
difference. Fourthly, if the righteousness prescribed in the Law could be
performed, then would the Law give life, according to that legal promise, he
that does these things shall live thereby, Levit. 18. 5. Ezekiel. 20. 11. Romans 10.
5. Gal. 3. 12. Romans 2. 13. and if there had been a Law given which could have
given life then there should have been righteousness (...), of, or by the Law,
Gal. 3. 21. and therefore that perfect righteousness justifying and giving
life, should be called (...) the righteousness which is of, or by the Law.
Fifthly, the righteousness of the Law is, as they teach, necessarily required
of all that shall be saved, and cannot be performed without grace and without
faith: and therefore, according to their doctrine, differs not at all from
the righteousness of faith, hoc est, says Bellarmine, operibus bonis
quaefiunt ex gratia and fide, that is, from good works, which are done by
grace and faith. So that by this goodly distinction, the Law and the Gospel,
the Law of works and the Law of faith, the righteousness of the Law, and the
righteousness of faith are confounded. For the righteousness of the Law is
charity proceeding from grace and from faith, 1 Timothy 1. 5. and the
righteousness of faith as Bellarmine here teaches are good works proceeding
from grace and faith. And yet I deny not, but that great difference is to be
made between the seeming obedience performed by carnal men without faith and
without grace, (which cannot truly be called righteousness) and the new
obedience of men spiritual and regenerate proceeding from faith working by
love, as the fruits of the Spirit. But neither the one, nor the other, is the
righteousness of Faith. The new obedience of the faithful is indeed a
righteousness begun, and performed in some measure (...), according to the
Law, Act. 22. 12. (...) according to the Commandments, 2 John 6. but the
righteousness of faith is this, that he who believes in Christ, in that he
believes, fulfilleth the Law. (...) he that believes in Christ fulfilleth the
Law, says Photius Photius apud Occum, in To. 10.
, and likewise Primasius Primas in Romans 10 3.
, qui in Christo credit, ipse perficit legem, for to him Christ is (...) the
end and complement of the Law, Romans 10. 4. and in him by Christ, (...) that
which the Law requires to justification is fulfilled, Romans 8. 4. Chrysostom
In Romans 10. ^om. 17.
, the end of the Law, says he, was that a man might be justified: but this
end, Christ (...) more amply performed by faith: fear not therefore (says
he) because thou art a transgressour of the Law, seeing thou art come to
faith. For then do thou transgress the Law, when by reason of it thou do
not believe in Christ: but if thou do believe in him, (...) thou have also
fulfilled the Law, and much more than it commanded: (...) for thou have
received a much greater righteousness, viz. the righteousness of Christ,
which is the righteousness of faith.

live. 3. c. 7.
who have justitiam in lege or ex lege in or by the Law, to fulfill justitiam
legis the righteousness of the Law. I answer, that Augustine disputing against
the Pelagians, who held that men might fulfill the righteousness of the Law by
the strength of nature, says, that they might have a kind of righteousness in
the Law or by it, which notwithstanding did not fulfill the righteousness of
the Law, which could not be done without the grace of the Spirit. By the
justice of the Law, Augustine means that which the Apostle calls (...) (for
otherwise Paul never so much as names the righteousness of the Law) that is,
whatsoever the Law requires to justification. This justice of the Law,
Augustine considers in the Abstract, as Bellarmine also himselse does in his
first book, De iustif. 41. c. 1.
for that righteousness of the Law, as it is described in the book of the
Law, being perfect and complete: which Bellarmine says is properly called the
justice of the Law, of which he says, justitia legis est in libris, the
justice of the Law is in books; even as habitual righteousness is in the
heart; and actual, in the hands. The justice in and by the Law he considers
in the concrete, with relation to the subject in whom it is, viz. for that
righteousness which men attain unto by their observation of the Law written.
And he proves against the Pelagians, that the righteousness, which they
seemed to have in lege, or ex lege, in or by the Law, did not fulfill justitiam
legis the righteousness of the Law: unto which we may add against the
Papists, that all the righteousness, even of the faithful also and
regenerate, (though endeavoring to live according to the Law, and according to
the Commandments), which they have in or by the Law, does not fulfill the
righteousness of the Law, which Paul calls (...), which Christ only
fulfilled for us: by whose (...), he being but one, we are justified, Romans 5.
18. For as the (...) or guilt by the fall of one man came upon all (...) to
condemnation; so by the (...) the righteousness of one whereby he fulfilled
the Law* (...) the grace of absolution and of Gods acceptance redounded upon
all unto justification of life. And thus this distinction makes against the
Papists. For justitia legis the justice of the Law considered in the abstract,
as it is described in the book of the Law, being most perfect, is never
fulfilled by that righteousness of the concrete in or by the Law, which men
not only carnal but spiritual also attain unto by their observation of the
Law, being always unperfect in this life and stained with the flesh. For even
as it may be said of all other graces, which being considered in the abstract,
are perfect, and are so defined: but considered in the concrete as they be in
men, who have received but the first fruits Romans 8. 23.
of the Spirit, according to the measure of the donation Ephesians. 4. 7.
of Christ, they are unperfect: So the righteousness of the Law, as it is
taught in the Law, and as it was performed by Christ, is perfect; but as it is
in all mortal men, it is unperfect. Therefore righteousness inherent in us is
not that righteousness of God by which we are justified.

. V. Our second argument. That doctrine, which confounds Arg. 2. the popish
doctrine confounds the Law and the Gospel.
the righteousness of the Law and of the Gospel, and by confounding them
makes void the Covenant of grace, is false and Antichristian.

The Popish doctrine of justification by inherent righteousness, confounds
the righteousness of the Law and of the Gospel, and makes void the covenant
of grace.

Therefore it is false and Antichristian.

The assumption is thus proved: whosoever makes the condition of justification
to be the perfect fulfilling of the Law in our own persons, confounds the
Gospel with the Law. For the righteousness of the Law is, the man that does
these things (which are prescribed in the Law) shall live by them: but the true
condition of the Gospel is, believe in Christ, and thou shall be saved. He
also makes void the Covenant of grace. For if justification be promised upon
condition of perfect obedience or righteousness, which condition is impossible
by reason of the flesh, then is the promise void and of none effect. But the
Papists make the condition of justification to be the perfect fulfilling of
the Law in our own persons, or perfect righteousness inherent. Again,
whosoever are made debtours to the whole Law, to them not only the covenant of
grace is void, but Christ himself is of none effect, as the Apostle teaches,
Gal. 5. 2, 3. But they who must be justified by inherent righteousness are
made debrours to the whole Law, which they must perfectly fulfill, else they
cannot be justified. But of this more Lib. 7 c. 3.
hereafter.

. VI. Our third argument, That doctrine, which depriveth Christians Thirdly, it
depriveth men of the chief part of Christian liberty.
of the chief part of that Christian liberty wherewith Christ has made us
free, is false and Antichristian. The popish doctrine of justification by
inherent righteousness depriveth Christians of the chief part of that
Christian liberty wherewith Christ has made us free: the chief part of our
liberty is, that, which we have by justification, wherein we are freed from
hell, and entitled to heaven. And that is a freedom from a double yoke of most
grievous bondage, wherein all are held that are under the Law: the former in
respect of the curse, under which all are, who in the least degree at any time
transgress the Law, Gal. 3. 10. which all do both often and grievously: the
other in respect of the rigor of the Law, excluding all men from justification
and salvation, who do not perfectly fulfill it: which by reason of the flesh
is unpossible. But by the popish doctrine the benefit of justification it self
is taken away, as I have showed, and with it, the liberty, which we have by it.
For if we cannot be justified but by perfect inherent righ^eousnes, then are we
subject to the curse, then are we excluded from all possibility of
justification and salvation as being sinners in our selves, wherefore all
those, who will stand fast Gal. 5. 1.
in that liberty wherewith Christ has made us free, must abhor the doctrine
of justification by inherent righteousness, which intangleth the imbracers of
it with this double yoke of bondage, whereby they are subjected to the curse
and damnation, and are excluded from heaven and salvation.

. VII. Our fourth Argument, No sinners, whiles they remain Fourthly, because
all men are sinners.
sinners, are justified by righteousness inherent.

All men whatsoever (Christ always excepted:) are sinners as I proved Supr. c.
2.. 9.
before, and so remain whiles they remain in the flesh.

Therefore no man whatsoever is justified by righteousness inherent.

This seems to be the Apostle argument in the three first Chapters of the
Epistle to the Romans: whosoever are sinners, they are not justified by the
works of the Law, that is to say, by no righteousness inherent in themselves
or performed by themselves.

All mortal men whatsoever, both Jews and Gentiles, are sinners, which he
proves at large. Therefore no mortal man whatsoever is justified by the works
of the Law, that is, by righteousness inherent.. VIII. Our fifth argument:
None that are accursed by the Law, Fifthly, because all men by the Law are
accursed.
are justified by their obedience to the Law, for to be justified is to be
blessed, Romans 4. 6.

All mortal men without exception are accursed by the Law, as the Apostle
proves, Gal. 3. 10. because all without exception have broken the Law.

Therefore none are justified by their obedience to the Law, and therefore not
by inherent righteousness.

. IX. Our sixth argument: whosoever is justified by inherent Sixthly, because
none fulfill the Law.
righteousness fulfilleth the Law.

But no mortal man does fulfill the Law, as I have elsewhere defended and
proved Supr. c. 5.. 3. Lib. 7. c. 6, and 7.
at large. And thus (...), hom. 17 in Romans 10. 5.
Chrysostom argues.

No man can be justified by the Law, unless he fulfill the whole Law, but this
is not possible for any man; therefore that righteousness is fallen to the
ground.

To this argument add a seventh as being a Consectary thereof: whosoever is
justified by inherent righteousness, and namely by charity, he is justified by
his own fulfilling of the Law. For charity is the fulfilling of the Law, but
no man is or can be justified by his own fulfilling of the Law, for none can
fulfill it: therefore none are justified by inherent righteousness.

. X. Our eighth argument: we are not justified before God: both Eigthly, Not by
faith and by works.
by faith and by works, by Gods righteousness and our own, by that
righteousness which is out of us in Christ, and by that which is inherent in
our selves. For the holy Ghost makes such an opposition between these, as
that they cannot stand together, Romans 3. 28. 4. 4, 5. 9. 30, 31, 32. 11. 5, 6.
Phil. 3. 9. Gal. 2. 16. 3. 11. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. But we are justified by faith, by
the righteousness of God through faith, by Christ's righteousness which is out
of us in him. viz. by his sufferings and by his obedience, as besides the
places even now quoted appears, Romans 5. 9. 19.

Therefore we are not justified by righteousness inherent in our selves.
Ninthly, because it is imputative.


. XI. Our ninth argument: Imputative righteousness is not inherent, as being
not ours, nor in us, but communicated to us by imputation.

The righteousness by which we are justified is imputative: that

I prove, first, by testimony, Romans 4. 6, 7, 8, 23, 24. for then is God said to
justify, when not imputing sin, he imputes righteousness without works.
Secondly, by reason. The personal righteousness of Christ is inherent in him
and not in us, being proper to his person, though by imputation communicated
unto us. The righteousness of God, by which we are justified, is the personal
righteousness of Christ, 2 Pet. 11. viz. his passive and active
righteousness, Romans 5. 9. 19. And that it is his personal righteousness,
appears evidently, because it is the righteousness and obedience of one only,
whereas if it were a righteousness from him in us, it would be the justice of
so many as are justified: so says the Council Sess 6 Sess. 7.
of Trent, justitiam in nobis recipientes unusquisque suam.

. XII. Our tenth argument. That justification which the Scripture Tenthly,
justification takes away boasting
teaches, takes away all matter of boasting, Romans 3. 27. Epbes. 2. 9.

But justification by works or by inherent righteousness does not take away
all matter of boasting, Romans 3. 27. 4. 2. Ephesians. 2. 9.

Therefore justification by works or inherent righteousness is not that which
the Scriptures teach, we must therefore say with Ambr. de Jacob. and vitabeata.
l. 1. c. 6. Sed and illud mihi prodest, quod non iustificamur ex operibus
legis. Non babeo igitur, unde gloriari in operibus, meis possim: non habeo unde
me jactem. Et idco gloriabo^ in Christo. Non gloriabor, quia iustus sum, sed
gloriabor, quia redemptus sum: gloriabor non quia vacuus p^cati sum, sed quia
mihi remissa sunt peccata. Non gloriabor, quia profui, nec quia profuit mibi
quisquam, sed quia pro me advocatus apud Patrem Christus est, sed quia pro me
Christi sanguis effusus est.
Ambrose, that is profitable to me, that we are not justified by the works of
the Law: wherefore I have not whereof to glory in my works, I have not whereof
to boast. And therefore I will glory in Christ. I will not glory because I am
just, but I will glory, because I am redeemed. I will glory, not that I am
without sin, but because my sins are forgiven me. I will not glory because
I have been profitable, or because any other has profited me, but because
Christ is an Advocate for me with the Father, and because his blood was shed
for me.

. XIII. Our eleventh argument: If there be no justification but by righteousness
inherent, and that also perfect and pure, then is justification promised upon
an impossible condition, and so consequently the promise should be void and of
none effect. But far be it from us to think, that the promise of
justification by Christ is void and of none effect. Therefore we are not
justified by works, or by righteousness inherent, but by faith, that the
promise might be sure to all the seed, as the Apostle reasons, Romans 4. 13,
14, 15, 16.

. XIV. Our twelfth argument: because unto justification concurreth Twelfthly,
because remission of sin is a necessary part of justification.
remission of sins, as a necessary part thereof: from whence three arguments
arise, First, true justification is not without remission of sin. The popish
justification by infusion of perfect righteousness is without remission of
sin. For although they pretend that to their justification concurreth
remission of sin: yet by remission they not understanding the pardoning or
forgiving, but the extinction and abolition of sin, have utterly excluded
from justification the forgiveness of sin, as I have showed before.
Secondly, unto true justification necessarily concurreth remission of sin.
And where is remission of sin, there is imputation of righteousness without
works. But in the popish justification there needs no imputation of
righteousness; and that for two reasons, which Bellarmine does prosecute at
large in his dispute against imputation. The one, because in justification by
infusion of righteousness, sin is fully expelled, and therefore no need of
imputation. And secondly, because the righteousness which is infused is
perfect of it self without imputation of any other righteousness. Thirdly, if
our justification and blessedness does consist in the forgiveness of our
sins, as it does Romans 4. 6, 7. ex Psalm. 32. 1. then not in perfect inherent
righteousness: for where is need of the forgiveness of sin, there is no
perfect righteousness inherent. And where perfect righteousness is infused,
there needs not imputation of righteousness.

. XV. Our thirteenth argument. If Abraham, David, and Paul Thirteenthly, from
the example of Abraham.
were not justified by righteousness inherent, then much less any of us, who
are so far inferior to any of them.

Not Abraham, whose example was a samplar in this behalf, Romans 4. 23, 24. For
as Abraham the father of the faithful was justified, so are we Abraham though
he were a mirror of piety abounding with good works; yet was not justified
thereby. As the Apostle proves, Romans 4. 3, 4, 5. For to whom righteousness is
imputed of grace through faith, he is not justified by works before God: And
contrariwise whosoever is justified by works, to him the reward of
righteousness is not imputed of grace, but rendered as a due and deserved debt,
ver. 4. To Abraham righteousness was imputed of grace through faith, verse. 3.
and 5. and therefore though he abounded with works, yet he was not justified
by works, verse 2. or inherent righteousness, but by faith without works. Of
David.


Not David: for he though a man according to Gods own heart, walking before
God 1 King. 3 6.
in truth and righteousness and in uprightness of heart: yet he desires the
Lord that he would not enter into judgment with him, for if he did, not only
himself, but no man living Psalm. 143. 2.
could be justified: for himself, he makes this confession, as De tempore
sermon. 49.
Augustine understands him, nam me invenies reum, si in judicium intraveris
mecum, for thou shall find me guilty, if thou shall enter into judgment with
me. And therefore he places his blessedness or justification, in the not
imputing of sin, and imputing of righteousness without works, Psalm. 32. 1,
2. Romans 4. 6, 7. and professes, Psalm. 71. 16. I will remember thy
righteousness only. Of Paul.


Not Paul: for he, though he knew nothing by himself, yet professes that he
was not thereby justified, 1 Cor. 4. 4. though he had lived after his
conversion in all good conscience before God, Act. 23. 1. though herein he did
exercise himself to have always his conscience Act. 24. 16.
(...), clear and without offense toward God and man: yet in the question of
justification he renounceth all his righteousness Phil. 3. 8, 9.
inherent, that he might be found in Christ endued with his righteousness. And
^o these we might add, Job, Esaias, and Daniel, who, as well as the former, Of
Job, Esaias, and Daniel.
had that righteousness which is a Domino, I mean, righteousness inherent,
but were not justified thereby, see Job, 9. 2, 3. 15. 20. 10. 15. 42. 6. Esai.
6. 1. 5. Dan. 6. 7. 18.

. XVI. Our foureteenth argument: The righteousness by which 14 because it is
not the righteousness of one.
we are justified, is the righteousness and obedience of one, and but of one,
Romans 5. 18, 19. Inherent righteousness is not of one, but of so many as are
endued therewith. Therefore inherent righteousness is not that whereby we are
justified.

CAP. IX. The several proof of our assertion, that we are justified by that
righteousness of Christ, which is out of us in him.
. I.

_^Ow I am to prove severally our assertion: that Arg. 1. because God accepte^h
Christ's righteousness in our behalf.
we are justified by Christ's righteousness. And first, I prove it by that
argument, which Bellarmines uses against De i^stif. l. 2 c. 5.. quartarati^
Osiander, what righteousness God accepts in our behalf, by that we are
justified: The righteousness of Christ which he performed for us in the days
of his flesh, God accepts in our behalf: otherwise, says he, why did the
Son of God take our flesh upon him, why did he humble himself to become
obedient until death, etc. Therefore by the righteousness of Christ performed
in his manhood, we are justified, etc.

. II. Hereunto I add a second out of the same place De iustif. l. 2. c. 5..
quod vero.
for Bellarmine, though he holds against Osiander, that we are not justified
by the essential righteousness of the Godhead: yet he confesses that the
Lord accepts of no righteousness as a satisfaction for sin, but that Arg.
2. God accept^th it alone as being of insinit^ val^.
which is of infinite value: such is the righteousness of Christ only in
regard of the dignity of his Person, being the true God, the great God, God
above all, blessed for ev^rmore; therefore by his righteousness only we are
justified: but of this see more Lib. ^. c. 7.. 3.
in the seventh Chapter here I argue thus: what righteousness the Lord
accepts as a full satisfaction for our sins, by that we are justified:

The righteousness of Christ the Lord accepts as a full satisfaction for our
sin, Therefore by Christ's righteousness we are justified. By Christ's
righteousness, I say, imputed, and accepted of God in our behalf. The
assumtion is thus proved. What righteousness is of i^finite value, that, and
that alone the Lord accepts as a full satisfaction for our sins.

The righteousness of Christ is of infinite value, as being the righteousness
of God, as it is often called.

It therefore, and by it alone the Lord accepts, as a full satisfaction for
our sins.

. III. My third argument shall be from those places, wherein either it is said,
that our righteousness is in Christ, Esai. 45. 24, 25. and that we are
righteous in him, 2 Cor. 5. 21. Phil. 3. 8, 9. or our Savior Christ himself
is said to be our righteousness. Jeremy prophesying of the Messiah the
righteous Branch, whom God would raise to David, says; In his days Judah shall
be saved, and Israel shall dwell sasely: and this is the name whereby he shall
be called, JEHOVAH our righteousness, Ier. 23. 6. and the very same prophecy
is repeated, I^r. 33. 16. that the Branch of righteousness should grow up to
David, in whose days Judah should be saved, and Jerusalem shall dwell safely:
and he who shall call her, that is, Jerusalem his Church (for so it ought to be
read) is JEHOVAH our righteousness, 1 Cor. 1. 30. But of him ye are in Christ
Jesus, who of God is made unto us, wisdom, and righteousness, and
sanctification, and redemption; where Christ is said to be made our
righteo^snesse. To this D^ (...) l. 2. c. 10.
Bellarmine answers: that Christ is rightly called our righteousness, for
two causes: first, because he is the efficient cause of our justice. For as God
in the Psalms is called our strength and our Salvation, because it is God that
strengthens and saves us, and in this place, as Christ is said to be made
our wisdom and redemption, because he makes us wise and redeemeth R^ply to
Bellar^nes ^st answer, that Christ is called (...) (...), because (...) is the
author of it.
us: So Christ is called our right^ousnesse, because he makes us just, viz. by
infusion of righteousness.

. IV. Reply, It is true, that Christ, when he does sanctify us by his Spirit,
is the Author of inherent righteousness in us: but this is that which
follows in the text, that he is our Sanctification. These two benefits, as
they are here distinguished, so they ought not to be confounded. Bernard in a
Sermon of his does oftentimes very elegan^ly go over these four unctions, as
he calls them, distinguishing justification and sanctification, as we do:
Christ, says he, was made unto us wisdom, in preaching; justice, in
absolution of sins; sanctification, in his conversation; redemption, in his
passion -- the shadow of thine ignorance he has driven away with the light of
his wisdom, and by that righteousness which is of faith he has loosed the
cords of sin, freely justifying the sinner: by his godly conversation he has
given a form of life, and by his death he has given a price of satisfaction
-- he freeth from error (by his wisdom) he covers faults (by his
righteousness) he gives merits (that is ability of working well) by his life,
and rewards by his death -- enlighten mine eyes O Lord that I may be wise,
remember not the sins of my youth and mine ignorances, and I am just: lead me
O Lord in the way, and I am holy: but unless thy blood mediate for me I am
not safe -- he was made unto us of God wisdom, teaching prudence; justice,
forgiving sins, etc. They only are wise who are instructed by his doctrine,
they only just who of his mercy have obtained pardon of sin, those only
temperate or holy, who study to imitate his life; they only valiant, who
imitate his patience.

. V. And that they are here to be distinguished, appears by Righteousness
here to be distinguished from Sanctification.
this consideration: that in this text all the benefits, which we have by
Christ besides our election, which is also noted in the first words (of him ye
are in Christ) are reduced unto four heads. For of God we were elected in
Christ, who of God is made unto us, wisdom, in our vocation; righteousness,
in our justification; holiness in our Sanctification; full redemption Ephesians.
1. 14. 4. 30. Romans 8. 23. Luke 21. 28.
in our glorification: that so we may learn not to boast in our selves 1 Cor.
1. 31.
, but to ascribe the whole glory of our salvation and of all the degrees
thereof, to Jesus Christ our alone and perfect Savior. To the like purpose In
^ocum.
Theophylact observes the order here used by the Apostle: first, he exempteth
from error, and making men wise instructs them to the knowledge of God: then
he gives the pardon of sins: and by his holy Spirit indueth them with
holiness: and then grants perfect deliverance from all evils, which he
calls redemption, as Chrysostom also and (...).
O^cumenius who observe the same order. And likewise Theoderet, he gave you
true wisdom, he gave unto you remission of sins, vouchsafing unto you
righteousness, and he made you holy, and delivered from the tyranny of the
Devil. All these four benefits are the fruits of Christ's office of mediation,
as he is our Prophet, our Priest, and our King. For as our Prophet, in whom are
all the treasures of Col. 2. 3.
wisdom and knowledge, he calls 2 These. 2. 14.
us by the Gospel, his doctrine Deuteronomy. 4 9. 1 Cor. 2. 6, 7.
being our wisdom, and making us wise 2 Timothy 3. 15.
unto salvation: as our holy Priest he justifies us, his sacrifice Romans 5 9
19.
and his obedience, being our righteousness: as our gracious and glorious
King, being ascended on high to prepare Jo^. 14. 2.
a place for us, he gives Ephesians. 4. 8.
the graces of his holy Spirit to his members, whereby they being sanctified
are fitted and prepared for his kingdom: and being gone to prepare a place for
us, and us for it, he Ioh. 14 3.
will come again to bring us (...) Ephesians. 1. 14. Luke 21. 28.
(...), to the redemption of possession or our full redemption, which is also
called (...), 1 These. 5. 9. (...), 2 These. 2. 14. (...), Heb. 10. 39. the
obtaining of salvation, the obtaining of glory, and the saving of the Soul,
and (...), the redemption of the body, Romans 8. 23. Christ therefore is of God
made unto us wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption or
salvation: because his wisdom is communicated unto us by instruction in our
vocation, his righteousness is communicated unto us by imputation in our
justification; his sanctifying graces by infusion in our sanctification, his
glory by possession or fruition, in our glorification.

. VI. In rendering the second cause, he confesses the truth: whereof
Bell^rmines second cause, why Christ is said to be our righteousness, because
he satisfied for us.
I desire the Reader to take special notice. That Christ is called our
righteousness, because he satisfied his Father for us: which his satisfaction
he does so give and communicate unto us, when he does justify us, that it may
be called our satisfaction and our righteousness. For although by justice
inherent in us we be truly called and are righteous: notwithstanding we do
not by it satisfy God for our faults and for eternal punishment -- And thus,
says he, it were not absurd to say, that Christ's righteousness and merits are
imputed unto us, when they are given and applied, as if we our selves had
satisfied God. And to that purpose he cites Epist. 190.
Bernard who says, that Christ died for all, ut viz. satisfactio unius omnibus
imputetur, that the satisfaction of one may be imputed to all but adds this
needless caution, modo non negetur, says Bellarmine, esse in nobis preterea
justitium inherentem ^amque veram, so it be not denied that there is in us
besides a justice inherent and that true: which, if Bellarmine would stay
there, we would yield unto. For we do not deny, that there is a righteousness
inherent in those that are justified, and that also a true, though not a pure,
a perfect and absolute righteousness: only we deny that we are thereby
justified. We are indeed just, but by Christ's righteousness, as Bernard says
in the same place: justum me dixerim, sed illius justitia.

. VII. This confession of Bellarmine dissolveth the very frame of Bellarmines
confession overthrows the popish doctrine of justification.
his own doctrine of justification: whereunto he has taught, that nothing
concurreth but deletion of sin, and infusion of righteousness. And these,
not as two acts, but as one act, viz. the infusion of righteousness expelling
sin. As for imputation of Christ's righteousness, he and his fellows deride
and scorn it. But here he confesses, (which needs must be confessed) that in
justification the satisfaction of Christ is imputed unto us, and accepted of
God in our behalf, as if we our selves had satisfied God: and that, for that
cause he is truly called our righteousness. And this imputation he
acknowledges to be necessary, because by righteousness inherent we do not
satisfy for our sins and eternal punishment: We say the same: only we
add that this satisfaction made by Christ in our behalf, is not only his
death and sufferings whereby he satisfied the penalty of the Law, and delivered
us from the curse, himself being made a curse for us: but also the holiness
of his person, and the obedience of his life, whereby he perfectly satisfied
the justice of God infulfilling the commandments. Now Gods acceptance of
Christ's satisfaction in our behalf, whereby he absolveth us from the guilt of
sin and damnation by imputation of Christ's sufferings, and his acceptance of
us as righteous in Christ, by imputation of his most perfect righteousness and
obedience, is that very thing, which we, according to the Scriptures, do call
justification, which distinct benefit of Christ not to be confounded with
sanctification, the Papists must learn to acknowledge, if they would be saved.

. VIII. To these I add other as plain testimonies, where it is Arg. 4.
because we are justified by the blood of Christ and by his obedience.
said, that we are justified by the blood of Christ, and his obedience. From
whence I argue thus:

If we be justifi^d by the blood and obedience of Christ, that is, by his
passive and active righteousness, then are we justified by the personal
righteousness of Christ, which being proper to his person, is out of us in
him. But we are justified by the blood and by the obedience of Christ, Romans 5.
9. 19. therefore by his personal righteousness.

. IX. Our fifth argument: By what righteousness our sins are Arg. 5. because
by Christ's righteouinesse out sins are covered.
covered, as with a garment, and by which we, being endued therewith, appear
righteous before God, that is the matter of our justification. For he is
justified whose sins are covered, Psalm. 32. 1.

By the righteousness of Christ, as a most precious robe of righteousness,
and as our wedding garment, our sins are covered. (For as ad Diogn^m
Justin Martyr truly says, (...) for what other thing was able to cover our
sins, but his righteousness?) and we being clothed therewith appear
righteous before God. Therefore by the righteousness of Christ we are
justified. Bellarmine De iustif. l. 2. cap. 11.
having, as it were, in our name objected to himself, Ephesians. 4. 22. 24. (which
none of us, that I know of, do object, for we acknowledge the place to be
understood of sanctification, which consiste^h in the putting off the old man,
and putting on the new) he says, that we argue from the similitude of a
garment, as more fitly resembling imputed justice than inherent: and that we
confirm it by the example of Jacob, who being clothed with the raiment of his
elder brother, obtained the blessing.

. X. To this Bellarmine shapeth two answers. First, that the similitude
Bellarmines first answer.
of a garment may fitly agree to inherent righteousness, which I will not deny:
for in the Scriptures theterme of clothing or putting on, is of a large extent:
so that he will confess, that the Hebrew Labash and the Greek (...), properly
signifying to cloth or to put on apparel, which is not inherent in the body,
but adherent, is more fitly by a metaphore applied to signify outward, than
inward indowments. And therefore that I may come to the proof of my
assumption, those phrases of putting on Christ and his righteousness, figured
by Jacob his putting on of his elder brothers apparel, Genesis 27. of the wedding
garment, Mat. 22. 11. of the first or chief robe, Luke. 15, 22. of the white
garment promised by Christ, Apoc. 3. 18. of the fine linen clean and shining,
which is the righteousness of the Saints. Apoc. 19. 8. (of which place I have
spoken before) are most fitly understood of the righteousness of Christ
imputed unto us, and put on as it were by faith. His second answer.


. XI. In his second answer Bellarmine confesses, that this similitude of
garments and that example of the Patriarch Jacob, may after a sound manner be
accommodated to righteousness imputed, if it shall be said, that it behooves
us to put on, or to be clothed with the merits of Christ: that, being after a
sort covered with them, we may ask of God pardon of our sins: for as I have
said before (says he) Christ alone was able to satisfy for our sins, and
indeed in justice did satisfy: and that satisfaction is given and applied to
us, and reputed ours, when wear reconciled unto God and justified. That
example therefore being referred to the righteousness of satisfaction for the
fault, it may be admitted. But if it be referred to that righteousness,
whereby we are formally justified, when of sinners and wicked men we are made
just and godly, it is by all means to be rejected; seeing it is manifestly
repugnant, to the Scriptures, to the Fathers, and to reason it self. For that
one man should satisfi^ for another, it may easily be conceived: but that one
man should be just, because another is just, was never heard of, and is not
only above, but also against reason,

. XII. Here, as you see, Bellarmine makes a distinction betwixt Reply to
Bellarmines answer.
the righteousness of satisfaction, and that by which we are formally made
just. But what is that righteousness of satisfaction? No doubt, that whereby
our Savior satisfied the Law for us; which he was to satisfy, as I have
showed before, not only in respect of the penalty threatened, by his
sufferings; but also in respect of the Commandment, by his perfect obedience
fulfilling the condition of the promise, Do this and live. To this, Bellarmine
acknowledges the similitude of garments and the example of the Patriarch Jacob
may fitly be applied: which is as much as we desire. For this is the whole
righteousness of justification, wherein the Lord imputing to a believer the
sufferings of Christ, covers, or not imputes or forgiveth his sins and the
punishment thereunto belonging; and imputing unto him the perfect obedience of
Christ, accepts of him as righteousness in Christ. For it is most certain,
that to whom the Lord imputes not sin, them he accepts as righteous: and
that he imputes righteousness, to whom he imputes not sin, Romans 4. 6, 7.
For as Bellarmine himself confesses, the not imputing of sin brings with
it the imputing of righteousness. Neither is it to be doubted, but that the
Lord accepts as well the merits of his obedience, as of his sufferings. And
what is that justice, whereby he says we are formally made just? no doubt
inherent justice, or the righteousness of sanctification, by infusion where of
sin is expelled. To this, says Bellarmine, the similitude of apparel and
the example of Jacob cannot be applied. For though one may satisfy for
another: yet one cannot be formally just by the righteousness of another:
which never any of us (to my knowledge) affirmed. The more absurd was
Bellarmine in thinking so absurdly of us. For because he confounds
justification and sanctification, he would needs bear the world in hand, that
we confounding them also, do teach, that we are formally made just by the
righteousness of another, which is out of us in him. But if justification and
sanctification are to be distinguished, as I have proved they must of necessity
be distinguished: then it will appear manifestly, that, that which Bellarmine
calls the justice of satisfaction, is the whole righteousness of
justification: and that, by which he says we are formally made righteous, is
the righteousness of sanctification. Now we are well content, that the
righteousness whereby we are sanctified, or formally made righteous, should
not be imputative: so that they will confess, that the righteousness of
Christ's whole satisfaction, whereby we are justified before God, is imputed
unto us: which they must confess, or else they cannot be saved. Here
therefore we may sing the triumph, and say; Magna est veritas and praevalet.

And thus have I abundantly proved, that the righteousness of Conclusion.
God, whereby we are justified, is not any righteousness inherent in us or
performed by us: but only the righteousness of Christ our Savior, which is
out of us in him, as being proper to his person; though by imputation
communicated to all that truly believe in him.

CHAP. X. Bellarmines eight allegations De iustif. lib. 2. cap. 3.
to prove justification by inherent righteousness, answered.
. I.

Bellarmines first allegation out of Romans 5. 17. 18, 19.
NOw I am to examine Bellarmines proofs. And first he alleges Romans 5. 17,
18, 19. out of which place he would prove, that to be justified by Christ is
not to be accounted or pronounced just, but to be truly made and constituted
just by obtaining inherent righteousness; and that, a righteousness not
unperfect, but absolute and perfect: for, that to justify, in this place, is
to makejust, and not to pronounce just, appears; first, out of those words,
verse 19. many shall be constituted or made just, unto which allegation I have
heretofore answered in his due Lib. 2. c. 5.. 1.
place so much as concerns the signification of the word, and have maintained
the exceptions of Calvin and Chemnitius, Ibid.. ^. 3, etc
against his cavils. His second reason is from the Antithesis of Adam unto
Christ. For thus, says he, the Apostle writes. As we are made unjust through
the disobedience of Adam, so we are made just through the obedience of Christ.

But it is certain, that through Adams disobedience we are made unjust by
injustice inherent, and not Non in iustitia Adaminobis imputata.
imputed:

Therefore through the obedience of Christ we are made just by righteousness
inherent, and not imputed.

Answ. We confess, that as from the first Adam we receive inherent corruption
in our carnal generation: so from the second Adam we receive inherent grace
in our spiritual regeneration, but this is not our justification, but our
sanctification, whereof the Apostle speaks not in this place, whereas
therefore he assumeth, that we are made unjust through Adams disobedience by
inherent injustice only not imputed, I deny the assumption, and return the
argument upon the Adversary.

As we are made sinners, that is, guilty of sin and damnation by Adams
disobedience or transgression: so we are justified, that is, not only
absolved from the guilt of sin, and damnation, but also accepted as righteous
unto salvation, by the obedience of Christ.

But we are made sinners, that is guilty of sin and damnation by imputation
of Adams disobedience, or transg^ession:

Therefore we are justified, that is, not only absolved from the guilt of
sin, but also accepted as righteous, by imputation of Christ's obedience.

As touching the proposition: that the word sinners does in this place signify
guilty of sin, and obnoxious to condemnation; it is testified by In locum.
Chrysostom, (...), what then is the word sinners in this place? it seems to
me, that it is to be subject or obnoxious to punishment, and condemned to
death: by Oecumenius (...), and by Theophylact likewise, sinners; that is
obnoxious to punishments and guilty of death, which exposition is plainly
confirmed by the verses going before, where the same opposition between the
first and second Adam being made, the ^ormer part is expressed in these words,
that the (...), or guilt of Adams transgression came upon his posterity (...)
unto condemnation, especially, verse. 16. and 18.

. II. The assumption, though gaine-said by Bellarmine in this place Whether
Adams sin be imputed.
yet is taught not only by other Papists, who fully contradict Bellarmines
Assumption but elsewhere also by Bellarmine himself. For Durandus, Controv. a.
de orig. pe^cat.
Pighius, In R^m. 5. in opuse. de lapsu ^ominis and orig. peccat. c. 6.
Catharinus, do hold original sin to be nothing else, but the guilt of
Adams fall, or the disobedience of Adam imputed unto us, which opinion also
Occam professes, that he would hold, if he were not hindered by the authority
of the Fathers. Yea, says De amiss. gratiae and stat. pec. l. 5. c. 16.
Bellarmine it seems to have been the opinion of some of the ancient, as 2
Sen^. did. 30.
Peter Lombard, reports. I^ refuting this opinion Bellarmine justly finds
fault with them, that they De amiss. gratiae and (...). pecca^. l. 5. c. 17.
held original sin to be nothing else, but the guilt of Adams disobedience
imputed, it being also the depravation of our nature following thereupon. But
in that they say, original sin is the disobedience of Adam imputed unto us,
that he does approve. For Adam alone did ind^ed commit that sin by actual
will. Ibid.. itaque.
but to us it is communicated by generation eo modo quo communicari potest id
quod transiit, nimirum per imputationem, after that manner whereby that may be
communicated which is transcient and gone, to wit by imputation. Omnibus enim
imputatur, etc. for it is imputed to all who are borne of Adam, because we all
being then in the loins of Adam, when he sinned, in him and by him we
sinned. Yea, and farther he rightly disputes, Ibid. c. 18. Reatus cum sit
relatio consequens actionem, qua ratione fieri potest, ut existat in eo, qui
non est particeps actionis (...) sio babitualis, nisi precesserit actuali^, ne
in^elligi qu^dem potest.
that if Adams sin were not ours by imputation, neither the guilt of it, nor
the corruption following upon it, had belonged to us. *This assertion of
Bellarmine confirms our assumption and contradicts his own, alleging that
we are made sinners through the disobedience of Adam by injustice inherent,
and not imputed: which also he contradicts in other places. For he grants
De amissi. gratiae and s^atu peccat. l. 4. c. 10.
the sin of Adam so to be imputed to all his posterity, as if they all had
committed that sin, and to the same purpose cites Bernard Sermon. de Dominica.
1. po^t octavas Epipha^iae.
. Ours is Adams fault, because though in another, yet we sinned; and to us it
was imputed by the just, though secret judgment of God. And again, De (...).

taking upon him to prove that the propagation of sin may be defended
without maintaining the propagation or traduction of the soul: he says, that
nothing else is required to the traduction of sin, but that a man be
descended from Adam by true and ordinary generation. For generation Ibid..
porro vere.
not being of a part, but of the person, or whole man (for homo generat
hominem) therefore the person descending from Adam (though his soul be from
God) was in the loins of Adam, and being in him originally, as in the root,
in him, and with him he sinned; the actual sin of Adam being communicated
unto him by imputatio^. For as Augustine says, definita est seutentia, etc. it
is a resolved case by the Apostle, that in Adam we all sinned.

. III. But what shall we say to the inherent corruption, which Whether
original corrupt^on be traduced from Adam.
Adam by his transgression contracted? By this assertion, it seems not to be
traducted otherwise, than as the fruit and consequent of the actual
disobedience: which was the opinion of Pighius and Catharinus For as Adam by
his first transgression, which was the sin of mankind, contracted not only
the guilt of death, but also the corruption of his nature, being both a
privation of original righteousness, and also an evil disposition and
pronenesse to all manner of sin, which is that macula peccati remaining in
the sinner after the act is gone: so we having sinned in Adam are not only
made guilty of death, and void of original righteousness; but also are
defiled with that habitual disposition and pronenesse to all manner of sin.
So that, according to this assertion, it may be defended, that nothing in our
generation is communicated unto us with the humane nature but the disobedience
of Adam, which is communicated by imputation. As for the guilt of death and the
inherent coruption, they are not derived from Adam, but contracted by our
sinning in him. And hereunto we may apply Bellarmines distinction De amiss.
gra. and statu pec. l. 5. c. 17.
of sin so properly called: that it is either a voluntary transgression, or
that blemish which remains in the soul, caused and contracted by the
transgression, being of the same nature with it, diffe^ing no otherwise from
it, than as heat from the act of heating. For in the former sense original
sin is the voluntary trangression of Adam imputed unto us, and is one and the
same in all men; in Adam actual and personal, in us original. For only he
by actual will committed it, but to us it is communicated, after that manner,
by which, that which is past and gone, may be communicated, to wit, by
imputation. In the latter sense it is the corruption inherent contracted and
caused, as in Adam by his personal sin, so in us by our sinning originally
in him, which though it be alike and equal in all, yet it is every man's own.

. IV. But supposing original sin, according to the received (...) the
transgr^ssion be after the same mann^r communicated.
opinion, to be wholly communicated unto us from Adam in our generation: yet we
must distinguish betwixt Adams first transgression or actual disobedience,
which we call his ^all; and the corruption or depravation of his nature, which
thereupon followed. For though we be partakers of both, yet not after the same
manner. Of the transgression we can be no otherwise partakers than by
imputation. For Adams transgression being an action, and actions continuing, or
having a being, no longer than they are in doing, cannot be traducted or
transmitted from Adam to his posterity. But the corruption being habitual, is
derivable by propagation. Now the Apostle, Romans 5. speaks of Adams actual
disobedience once committed by him, by which he says we are made sinners, that
sin of his being communicated unto us by imputation; and not of the
corruption thereupon following. So by the like reason we are made just by the
obedience of Christ, which he performed for us in the days of his flesh,
which can no otherwise be communicated unto us, than by imputation.

Object, Yea, but we are truly made sinners by the disobedience of Adam, and
truly made righteous by the obedience of Christ. Answ. As we are truly made
sinners by imputation of Adams disobedience; so we are as truly made righteous
by imputation of Christ's obedience. Just. Yea, but we are made sinners by
injustice inherent through Adams disobedience, and therefore we are made just
by inherent justice, through ^he obedience of Christ. Answ. We are not made
sinners in respect of inherent justice by Adams disobedience formally, as De
iustif. l. 2. c 9. Quartum.
Bellarmine says, ( Inobedientia Adami nos cons^ituit peccatores, non
formaliter sed (...)) for that only is imputed, but by the corruption which
follows and is caused by that transgression, committed by Adam, and imputed
to us. In like manner, we are not made just in respect of inherent justice, by
the obedience of Christ, whether active or passive formally, for that is only
imputed; but by the graces of the Spirit merited by the obedience of Christ,
performed by him, and imputed to us.

. V. Thus then stands the comparison betwixt the first and the Comparison
betwixt the first and second Adam.
second Adam. As by the actual disobedience or transgression of the first Adam
all his off spring were made guilty of sin, and subject to death, his
disobedience being not inherent in them, but imputed to them, as if it were
their own, because they were in him originally: so by the obedience of the
second Adam all his Heb. 2. 13.
off spring are or shall be justified from sin and accepted to life, his
obedience not being inherent in them, but imputed to them, as if it were their
own, because by faith they are in him. And this is our justification by
imputation of Christ's righteousness. And further as Adams fall deserved, as a
just punishment, the defacing of Gods image by inherent corruption in all his
posterity, to whom the same corruption is by natural generation transfused: so
the obedience of Christ merited, as a just reward, the restoring of Gods image
in us by inherent righteousness in all the faithful, into whom the said
righteousness is in their Spiritual regeneration infused. And this is our
Sanctification by the Spirit of Christ, of which the Apostle speaks not
until the next Chapter, where he shows, that our justification is always
accompanied with Sanctification. In a word from either of the two Adams we
receive two things, which are contrary each to other. From the first Adam, his
disobedience is communicated unto us by imputation, whereby we are made
sinners, that is, guilty of sin and damnation; which guilt is opposite to
justification, and secondly the corruption, which he contracted, is transfused
unto us by carnal generation, which corruption is contrary to sanctification.
From the second Adam, his obedience is communicated to us by imputation,
whereby we are constituted just, that is, absolved from the guilt of sin and
damnation, and accepted in Christ as righteous and as heirs of eternal life
which is the benefit of justification, and secondly, the graces of his holy
Spirit, which he received without measure, are in some measure as it were by
influence infused into us by our spiritual regeneration. This place alleged
by Bellarmine makes not for him, but most strongly against him.


. VI. Whereas therefore he would prove out of this place, that justification
is the obtaining of righteousness inherent. I answer, first, that to be
constituted sinners by Adams disobedience, is to be made guilty of sin and
subject to death and damnation: and so contrariwise, to be constituted just or
justified by Christ's obedience, is to be acquitted from the guilt of sin and
damnation, and to be accepted unto life: secondly, that we are constituted
sinners by Adams personal sin, which is not inherent in us, but once, and
that long since committed by him: so we are justified by Christ's personal
obedience, which is not inherent in us, but long since performed by him:
thirdly, that as we are truly made sinners by imputation of Adams
transgression which is not inherent in us: so we are truly made just by
imputation of Christ's obedience, which is not inherent in us: fourthly, that
the disobedience of the first Adam is imputed to all his children, because they
were in him originally, as the root; so in him they sinned, and therefore when
he did fall, they fell: so the second Adams obedience is imputed to all the
sons of God, because by faith they are in him, as his members, the head and
the members making but one body. This place therefore alleged by Bellarmine,
makes wholly against him. Neither does that, which he adds concerning
persect, absolute and abundant righteousness communicated unto us by Christ,
agree to that righteousness, which is in herent in us, unperfect and but
begun, as being the first fruits of the Spirit; but to the absolute and most
perfect righteousness of Christ communicated unto us by imputation. On this
place I have insisted the longer, because, though Bellarmine allege it as a
prime place to prove his purpose; is notwithstanding a most pregnant testimony
to prove justification by impu^ation of Christ's righteousness, as hereafter
shall further appear. Lib. ^. c. 2. 1. Testimome 2. Romans 3. 24.


. VII. His second Testimony is, Romans 3. 24 which I have also heretofore fully
proved to make wholly against him, Lib. 3. Cap. 3. and 4.

His third allegation is out of ^ Cor. 6. 11. to which also have I answered
Lib. 2. c. 3.. 3. Testimony 3. 1 Cor. 6. 11.
before I where acknowledged the benefit of baptism to be here described,
according to that which here he alleges out of Chrys^st. Ambrose, Theophylact
and others which is noted first, generally in the word washed, and then
particularly in the words Sanctified, and Justified; the former, signifying the
cleansing of the Soul from the pollution of sin; the latter, from the guilt
of sin: the former wrought by the Spirit of our God; the latter, by faith in
the name of the Lord Jesus. And these two distinct benefits the Scriptures
ascribe to Baptism, viz. remission of sins, and regeneration, as I showed
before. And therefore these benefits which the Holy Ghost has accurately
distinguished, ought not to be either ignorantly or Sophistically confounded.
And whereas he says, that these benefits (as here it is noted) are wrought by
the invocation of the name of Christ, and by the power of his Spirit, neither
of which is needful to justification, by declaration or imputation: he says,
he knows not what. For to justification (as we conceive of it) to be granted
and sealed in Baptism, both these are as needful; as to Sanctification. For
to the obtaining of the remission of sins to be sealed unto us in Baptism,
invocation of the name of God is required, Act. 22. 16. and it is the Spirit of
Adoption, which by Baptism seals unto us the remission of our sins.

. VIII. His fourth testimony is Tit. 3. 1. 6, 7. whence he argues Testimony
4. Tit. 3. 5, 6, 7.
to this effect:

Rege^ration ^r ren^vation is formally wrought by some inherent gift:
Iustisication according to the Apostle in this place is regeneration ^r
renovation. Therefore justification is formally wrought by some inherent gift.
The proposition, which no man denies, he laboreth to prove by three arguments,
which he might very well have spared; but that he would have the world to
think, that we deny sanctification to be inherent. The assumption (which do we
deny) he proves by his own authority; alleging, that in the fifth and the
sixth verses, The Apostle describes justification (which indeed he does not)
to be regeneration and ren^vation wrough^ in us out of the bounty of God by the
laver of Baptism, and effusion of the holy Ghost. This we deny: first, because
the word justify, never in the whole Scriptures is used in that sense:
secondly, here the Apostle in plain terms says, that we are justified and
saved not by works of righteousness, whereby is excluded all justice inherent,
but by Gods grace. How then does he prove it? because in these words, verse. 7,
that being justified by his grace we might be heirs in hope of eternal
life, the Apostle renders a reason, why God by the laver, and by the Holy
Ghost did regenerate and renew us, and says the cause was, that being
justified, that is, says he, that being by that regeneration and renovation
justified, we might Esfici mereamur.
deserve to be made heirs of the kingdom, and of life everlasting. Answ. This
gloss, makes the Apostle not like himself, but like a popish merit-monger,
corrupts the text, which indeed does parallel that, 1 Cor. 6. 11. showing how
men converted from Gentilisme to Christianity should be exhorted to the
performance of Christian duties. For howsoever whiles they were Gentiles, they
were addicted to many vices and sins: yet after they were called (which the
Apostle expresses thus; after that the bounty and humanity of God was
manifested, viz. by the preaching of the Gospel) God, not out of any desert of
theirs, but out of his mere mercy, saved them by Baptism (as Saint 1 Pet. 3.
21.
Peter also speaks) that is, justified them, for that is the salvation we
have here, to be entitled to salvation, or saved in hope; that being justified
by his grace, that is, (as he said before) by his undeserved mercy, they should
be made heirs, according to hope of eternal life, that is, they might be
saved in hope. Of this sentence therefore stripped of its amplifications, as it
were its garments, the naked substance is this. But after we were called, God
by Baptism justified us, that being justified by his grace, we might be saved
in hope. The amplifications which are added, are to set forth and describe
Baptism unto us: which as he had noted to be the seal Romans 4. 11.
of that righteousness which is by faith, when he says, that God justified or
saved us by it: so he calls it the laver of regeneration and of the
renovation wrought by the Spirit, which God has plentifully bestowed upon us.
So that these words are not a description of justification, as Bellarmine
dreameth waking, but of Baptism. And they are added according to the purpose
of the Apostle in this place, as arguments to move men to Christian duties.
Why? Because Baptism, as it was a seal unto them of their justification; so
also a Sacrament of their regeneration and renovation of the Spirit; which
Spirit God has poured forth plentifully upon the faithful: which he speaks
to this end, that the faithful which are Baptized, should make this use of
their Baptism, not only as of a seal to assure them of their justification
and salvation: but also to be a Sacrament, token, memorial of their
regeneration and renovation wrought by the Spirit plentifully poured upon them.
(To which purpose the Apostle tells the Romans 6. 4. 6.
Romans, that so many as were baptized into Christ, were baptized into the
similitude of Christ's death and resurrection) whereupon the Apostle infers
in the next words verse. 8. this is a faithful saying, and these things I will
thou should affirm and confirm, that they which have believed in God,
ought to be careful precedents of good works. The Apos^le therefore does not
say (as Bellarmine makes him speak) that we are justified, or saved, or made
heirs of salvation by regeneration or renovation, and much less that thereby
we merit our inheritance: but that God has justified, or saved us
Sacramentally by Baptism, which as it is the seal of our justification and
salvation; so it is also the laver of regeneration and renovation wrought by
the Spirit, that being justified by his grace we might, according to hope, be
made heirs of eternal life. For howsoever we are neither justified nor saved,
nor made heirs of eternal life, by our Sanctification: yet Sanctification is,
both the way, wherein from our justification we are to walk Ephesians. 2. 10.
unto glorification. For God has chosen us to salvation through the
sanctification of the Spirit, 2 These. 2. 13. and therefore sanctification, as
it is a necessary consequent of our justification, so it is a necessary
forerunner Heb. 12. 14.
of glorification, a necessary mark and cognizance of all that are justified
and to be saved. And therefore ou^ Savior says, Act. 26. 18.
that by faith in him we receive remission of sins, and inheritance among
them that are sanctified and so the Apostle also, Act. 20. 32.

. IX. His fifth testimony is, Heb. 11. and some other places of the Testimony
5. Heb. 11. etc. where some men have been absolutely called just.
Scripture, which do give testimony to some men, that they were truly, and
perfectly just, and that not by an imputative justice, but inherent: his reason
is, because the Scriptures would not call them absolutely just, if they were
not absolutely just. Answ. To omit, that it is one thing to be absolutely
called just, and another to be just absolutely and perfectly: I answer, that
the faithful, who are commended in the Scriptures for righteous, were
righteous, by a twofold justice, both imputative and inherent. The former,
being the righteousness of justification; the latter, of sanctification: the
former, absolute and perfect; the latter, inchoated and unperfect. By the
former they were justified before God: in respect of the latter, though they
were also called just, yet they were not justified thereby: that is, they were
neither absolved thereby from their sins past, nor entitled to the kingdom
of heaven; as may appear by all those Arguments which before I produced
against justification by inherent righteousness. As for those examples, which
he alleges out of Heb. 11. (which is the Chapter of says,) namely of Abel,
verse. 4. and Noah, verse. 7. etc. it is evident, that they were justified by the
righteousness which is of faith (as is expressly said of Noah, verse. 7.) that
is, by the righteousness of Christ apprehended by faith, and imputed to them
that believe: for the righteousnefse, which is of faith, is imputative, Romans 4.
5. And when it is said, that without faith they could not possibly have pleased
God, Heb. 11. 6.
it is plainly intimated that by faith they pleased God, and that they being
besore justified by faith, brought forth the fruits of faith acceptable unto
God. by which their faith was approved. But as they were just by imputation,
that is to say, justified; so also by infusion, that is, sanctified. For the
justifying faith, being a lively and effectual faith, purifieth Act. 15. 9.
the heart, and works by Gal. 5. 6.
love and may be demonstrated by Ia^. 2. 18.
good works. And where is not inherent righteousness concurring with faith,
there is no justifying faith at all. But although sanctification do always
accompany justification; yet we are not justified by the righteousness of
sanctification, which is inherent: because it is unperfect, and we are
sanctified but in part, whiles we have the flesh, that is, the body of sin
remaining in us. Neither was there ever any man since the fall absolute or
perfect in respect of inherent righteousness, Christ only excepted.
Bellarmines object. that some men have been perfect.


. X. Yea; but says Bellarmine the Scripture acknowledges some men to have
been perfect, Genesis 6. 9. immaculate, Psalm. 119. 1. just before God, Luke 1. 6.

I answer, that this perfection is not legal, as being a perfect conformity
with the Law, which is the perfect rule of righteousness; but evangelical, as
being one of the properties of our new obedience, which is not* to be measured
by the perfect performance, but by the sincere and upright desire and purpose
of the heart. For this uprightness goes under the name of perfection; and
what is done with an upright heart, is said to be done with a perfect heart,
and with the whole, that is entire heart. And likewise those men who were
upright, are said to have been perfect. And yet notwithstanding all those men,
who are said in the Scriptures to have been perfect and to have walked before
God with a perfect heart, as Noah, Jacob, Job, David, Ez^kias, etc. had their
imperfections* Ezekias is said to have been a perfect man, and to have served
God with a perfect heart: notwithstanding when God left him a little to try him
he discovered his imperfections, 2 Chr. 32. 25. 31. Of Asa it is said, 2 Chronicles.
15. 17. that his heart was perfect all the days of his life, and yet in the
very 2 Chronicles. 19. 7. 10. 1^.
next chapter there are three faults of his recorded; where Zachary is said to
have been just before God, and to have walked in all the Commandments and
Ordinances of God blameless: in the same chapter Luke 1. 20. 62.
his incredulity is registered, for which he was stricken with dumbness and
deafness for the space of ten months. So that all that are sincere and
upright, that is to say, no hypocrites, are notwithstanding their imperfections
called perfect, and so the word which is translated immaculate, Psalm. 119. 1.
signifies upright; and to be righteous before God is all one with upright.
Thus the holy Ghost teaches us to expound the word, which is translated
perfect, viz. thamin and tham, that to be upright is to walk before God is to
walk before God and to walk before God is to be perfect, Genesis 17. 1. Let
perfection and uprightness preserve me, Psalm. 25. 21. Psalm. 37. 37. Observe
the perfect man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace.
Bellarmine proves that they who are said to have been just, were endued with
inherent righteousness.


. XI. Yea but Bellarmine will prove, that these men which are in the Scriptures
called just, were endued with inherent righteousness, because they brought
forth good works, which were the fruits and effects of their inward
righteousness: for he that does 1 Job. 3. 7.
righteousness is righteous: whom does he now confute? we do not deny them,
who are commended in the Scriptures for righteous persons, to have been endued
with righteousness inherent: but we deny, that they, or any of them, were
justified before God thereby. As for example, Abraham, who abounded with good
works, was justified by faith without works, Romans 4. 2, 3. and as he was
justified, so are all the faithful. Romans 4. 23, 24. David, though a man
according to Gods own heart, walking before 1 King. 3. 6.
him in truth, and righteousness, and uprightness of heart; yet professes,
that neither he, nor any man living, Psalm. 143. 2.
could be justified, if God should enter into judgment with them, and
therefore places his happiness and justification, notin his virtues or good
works, but in the not imputing of sin, and imputation of righteousness without
works, Romans 4. 6. Paul, though he knew nothing by himself, yet professes,
that he was not thereby justified, 1 Cor. 4. 4. Yea, in the question of
justification, he esteems his own righteousness of no worth, Phil. 3, 8,
9. But as we do not deny the faithful to be endued with inherent
righteousness; so we affirm, that whosoever is justified by imputative
righteousness, is also sanctified in some measure with righteousness infused
and inherent. In respect whereof, though they be also sins in themselves, by
reason of their habitual corruptions, and actual transgressions, being in
part carnal and sold under sin, Romans 7. 14. 23
and by the Law, which is in the members, led captive to the Law of sin: yet
they have their denomination from the better part. Even as a wedge of metal,
wherein much dross is mingled with Gold, is called a wedge of Gold, though not
of pure Gold* and an heap of Corn, wherein is as much chafe as Wheat, is
called an heap of Wheat, though not of pure Wheat: So the faithful man in
whom there is the flesh and body of sin, as well as the Spirit and regenerate
part, is called of the better part a righteous man, though not perfectly,
absolutely, purely, just in respect of his righteousness inherent. Indeed
every true believer, so soon as he is indeed with a true justifying faith, is
perfectly just, by righteousness imputed; but at the best he is sanctified
only in part.

. XII. His sixth testimony is taken out of Romans 8. 29. and 1 Cor. Testim. 6.
Romans 8. 29. 1 Cor. 15. 49 from whence three reasons are collected. The first
reason
15. 49. where it is said, that the just are conformable to the image of
Christ, and do bear the image of the second Adam, as they have borne the
image of the first Adam, from whence he collecteth three reasons: The first,

As Christ was just, so are we* and as he was not just, so ^re not we.
But Christ was just by inh^rent right^ousnesse, and not by imputati^n:
Therefore we are just by inherent righte^usnesse, and not by imp^tation.
The proposition he proves by the places alleged.

First I answer to the proof of the proposition; that the places alleged
Answ. 1. to the proof of the proposition.
are imperti^ent: For the question being of the righteousness of
^ustification, never any understood the Apost^e in these places to speak
thereof: But either of filiation, as Chrysostom and others understand the
former plate, because as Christ is the Son of God, so also are we: or of
afflictions, because whom God has predestined to be like his Son in
glory, they shall be conformable to the image of his Son in bearing the
Cross (which sense is given by our Write^s and is agreeable to the scope of
the Apostle in that place to the Romans) or of Glory, that when he shall
appear we shall be like him in glory: of which as Ambrose, Sedulius and
others understand, Romans 8. ^9. fo the other place 1 Cor. 15. 49*
being read in the future, as it ought to be in the latter branch (as we have
borne the image of the earthy, so we shall bear the image of the heavenly) is
necessarily to be understood. Or of holiness as Oecumenius understands that
place, that as he is holy, so we should be holy also. Neither is it to be
doubted, but that the image of God, according to which we are renewed,
consists in true holiness and righteousness but that is the righteousness of
sanctification, whereby we resemble the image of Christ in true righteousness and
holiness. But the righteousness of justification is Christ's righteousness it self,
not the image of it. Answer to the proposition it self.


. XIII. As touching the proposition it self; we must distinguish betwixt the
thing, and the manner. In respect of the thing, it is true, that Christ is
righteous, and so are all his members. But in respect of the manner* it is not
true, neither generally, nor adaequate or reciprocally, as Bellarmine
understands it: who from thence argues negatively, as well as affirmatively.
For things that be like are not like al^ogether, and in all respects: as may
appear by other resemblances, in respect whereof we are said to bear the
image of Christ. As first in respect of filiation. Christ is the Son of God,
and so are we. True, in respect of the thing, but not true in respect of the
manner. For he is the Son of God by nature, and by eternal generation: but
we are the Sons of God in him by grace of regeneration and adoption.
Secondly, in regard of the Cross. Christ did bear the Cross, and so do we.
True in respect of the thing, but not true in respect of the manner. For
Christ's sufferings were the (...) the price of ransom which he as our
Redeemer laid down for us. But we do not suffer as redeemers, neither are
our sufferings (...) a price of ransom, but either (...) 1 Cor. 11. 32.
chastisements for sin, or (...) trialls for our good, Deuteronomy. 8. 16.
or (...) our sufferings Phil. 1. 29.
for Christ, or (...) that is such chastisements or corrections as the Lord
lays upon his children having scandalously offended, to vindicate 2 Samuel 12.
14.
his own honor. Thirdly, in respect of glory; Christ is glorified, and so
shall we, who bear his image, true in respect of the thing, but not in respect
of the manner: for he as the head, we as the members, according to our
proportion. Fourthly, in respect of holiness or sanctification. Christ was
holy, and so are we, true in respect of the thing, for whosoever is in Christ
he is a new 2 Cor. 5 17.
creature, renewed according to his image in true holiness, but not in respect
of the manner. Christ was holy from his conception, and originally, so are not
we. Christ in himself was perfectly just and holy without blemish of sin,
so are not we. We do not bear^the image of Christ in r^spect of the
righteousness of justification


. XIV. But as touching the righteousness of justification, we are not said to
bear Christ's image. Neither can Christ be said truly and properly to be
justified as we are. For justification properly is of a sinner, and it
consists partly in remission of sin. But if in respect thereof we did bear
Christ's image, then in imitation of Bellarmine we might conclude: As Christ
was not just, nor made just, so neither are we. But Christ was not just, nor
made just by the benefit of justification; in like manner neithetare we just
or made just by the benefit of justification, which is evidently false. But in
respect of our justification we may rather use that similitude of the Apostle,
2 Cor. 5. 21. As Christ was made sin or a sinner for us, so we are made
righteous with the righteousness of God in him. Christ was made a sinner for
us, not by inherencie (God forbid!) but by imputation of our sin. Therefore
we are made righteous in our justification, not by inherencie, but by
imputation of his righteousness.

. XV. Secondly, he reasons thus: If we be not just by iuberent His second
reason.
righteousness, but by imputation only, or as he speaks (like a cavilling
Sophister) putative, and not indeed, being indeed unjust, then do we bear the
image of the Devil rather than of Christ. For more rightly have we our
denomination from that which we are, than from that which we are only supp^sed
to be. I answer, first, that whosoever is just by imputation, be is not
putative only just, but truly and indeed. For though he be a sinner in
himself (as all but Papists are) yet he is righteous, or as the Apostle
speaks the righteousness of God in him, 2 Cor. 4. 21. Secondly, that the
faithful are just, not only by righteousness imputed, which is the
righteousness of justification: but also in respect of justice inherent, which
is the righteousness of sanctification, in regard whereof all the faithful
are called Saints, as Romans 1. 7, Romans 16. 15. 1 Cor. 1. 2. 2 Cor. 1. 1. Phil.
1. 1. 4. 22. 1 Timothy 5. 10.
etc. Thirdly, although the faithful be sinners in themselves, yet being
regenerate and sanctified in part, they have their denomination from their
better part, and are called just, though not purely and perfectly just, as I
have showed before.

. XVI. His third reason: Of the earthy Adam, who was a sinner, we His third
reason
have borne the true image; because sin was not in us putative but truly and
indeed: so the true image of Christ we shall bear, if justice be inherent in
us not putative; but truly and indeed.

Answer. As we receive two things from the first Adam, viz. the guilt of his
sin communicated, as Bellarmine himself confesses, by imputation, by which
we were truly made sinners, and truly obnoxious to death and damnation, which
is opposite to justification, and by it is taken away: and secondly, the
corruption of his nature which he drew upon himself, being propagated by
carnal generation, which is opposite to sanctification, and by it in some
measure, and by degrees is taken away: so from the second Adam we receive also
two things, the merits of Christ's sufferings and obedience communicated by
imputation, by which we are truly made just, and heirs of eternal life; and
the virtue of his death and resurrection derived unto us by spiritual
regeneration; by which we bear the image of the second Adam, as truly,
though not so fully in this life, as by carnal generation we did bear the
image of the first Adam. But this withal is to be observed, that as we do
bear the image of the first Adam in respect of the corruption derived unto us
by generation, and not in respect of the participation of his transgression,
for in him we sinned and were guilty of the same transgression with him, it
being communicated unto us by imputation: so we do bear the image of the
second Adam in respect of holiness and righteousness derived unto us from him
in our regeneration, by which we are renewed according to his image in true
righteousness and holiness) and not in respect of our justification, wherein
the same righteousness and obedience which he performed in the days of his
flesh is communicated unto us by imputation, and accepted of God in our behalf
as if we had performed the same in our own persons. To conclude therefore, it
is not the image of Christ's righteousness and obedience by which we are
justified: But we are justified by the righteousness and obedience of Christ
it self.

. XVII. His seventh Allegation of Romans 6. 4. 6. is scarce worth Bellarmines
seventh allegation Romans 6. 4. 6.
the answering, wherein he proves, which no man denies, that the godly do
truly, and not putative dye unto sin, and rise unto righteousness; even as
Christ whose death and resurrection is represented in Baptism, did truly dye
and rise again.

For this dying unto sin, and rising unto righteousness are the two parts of
our sanctification; which never any denied to be inherent. But that
justification and sanctification are not to be confounded, I have before Lib.
2.
proved at large. If he would have said any thing to the purpose, he should
have said any thing to the purpose, he should have proved, that our
justification consists in our mortification and vivification: and then might
he well have concluded, that we are not justified by imputation, but by
inherent righteousness. But I cannot sufficiently wonder at the blind malice
of these men, who either would persuade themselves, or would go about to
persuade others, that we hold the righteousness of sanctification and the
parts thereof, which we acknowledge to be wrought in us by the holy Spirit, not
to be inherent, but imputative. As for these words verse. 7. he that is dead is
justified from sin: the meaning is, as I have showed before, Lib. 2. c. 2.. ^
that he is freed from sin, as our translation reads, and as Chrysostom
and Oecumenius expound it: the special sense of freeing from guilt opposed to
condemnation, which is the proper sense of the word, Act. 13. 38, 39. extended
to the general signification of freedom: he that is dead is freed from
committing of sin, according to that place of Peter, 1 Epist. 4. 1. which
Bellarmine paralelleth with this, he that has suffered in the flesh has
ceased from sin.

. XVIII. In his eighth allegation he patcheth diverse places of Scripture
together, as it were invita Minerva, out of which nothing Bellarmines eighth
allegation.
can be concluded, but that the Papists have not one found Argument to prove
their justification by inherent righteousness. The places which he patcheth
together are these, Romans 8. 15. That we now by Christ have received the Spirit
of Adoption of the sons of God, quoad animam, says he, in respect of the
Soul, the which, as it is there said, (viz. verse. 10.) lives by reason of
justification, although the body be dead, (that is, be mortal as yet) by
reason of sin. But (says he) ^ little after, (viz. verse. 23. he adds, that
we having the first fruits of the Spirit, do groan within our selves,
expecting the adoption of the sons of God, even the redemption of our body.
For as the same Apostle says Phil. 3. 20. 21. we expect our Savior who shall
reform the body of our humility, configured to the body of his glory. But the
adoption of sons, which we expect in the redemption of the body shall be
most true and inherent in the body it self, that is to say immortality and
impossibility, not putative, but true. Therefore the adoption, which now we
have in the spirit by justification, must also be true, not putative, otherwise
as we expect the redemption of the body, so also we should expect the
redemption of the soul. Answ. See what poor shifts so learned a man is put
unto, according to the ancient profession of Sophistres noted by Plato, (...)
to make good a bad cause. This is Bellarmines whole dispute word for word:
where with much travel he has brought forth this conclusion that our
adoption, which now we have by justification is true, and not in conceit only:
which we freely confess. For whoever denied, that our adoption is as true, as
our justification? But does it from hence follow, that we are justified by
inherent righteousness? A good syllogism concluding that assertion from those
premises had been worth his labor. The most that can be said in this
matter, as I suppose, is this. That when our gracious God by his holy Spirit
does regenerate us, he does beget in us the grace of faith. As soon as faith
is wrought in us, we are engrafted into Christ: to us being in Christ, the
Lord communicates the merits of his Son; by imputation of whose
righteousness unto us, he, remitting our sins, does not only accept of us,
as righteous in Christ; but also in him he adopteth us to be his Sons and
heirs of eternal life.

. XIX. Let this proposition then tanquam commune principium Such as is our
adoption, ^ such is our justification.
be agreed upon between us. Such as is our adoption, such is our
justification: and let us see, what either of us can infer thereupon.
Bellarmine assumeth thus: but our adoption is not imputative, for that I
suppose is his meaning by that odious word putative, as though if it were
imputative, it were but putative, which is most false. For he that either is a
sinner by imputation of Adams transgression, is as truly a sinner, as by
transfusion of the corruption: yea, if he had not been truly a sinner by
imputation of Adams guilt, he should never have been punished, either with
the transfusion of the co^ruption, or with death, unto which by the guilt he
was bound over: or he that is righteous by imputation of Christ's
righteousness, is as truly righteous before God; yea, more truly, than by
infusion of inherent righteousness. For that is perfect; this is stained with
the flesh, and therefore is but a sinful righteousness, which cannot stand
in judgment before God, judging according to the sentence of his Law. But
Bellarmine assumption, as I was saying, is this. Our adoption is not
imputative, but by grace inherent: therefore our justification is not
imputative, but by righteousness inherent. The assumption, which is utterly
false, he endevoreth to prove, because the Apostle, Romans 8. 15. says, that
now by Christ we have received the Adoption of the sons of God, quoad
animam, (says Bellarmine, that he might patch with it, verse. 10.) in respect
of the soul, which, as it is there said, lives pr^pter justificationem,
although the body be dead, that is to say, mortal, by reason of sin. These
places Bel^mine alleged before, to prove that the grace by which we are
justified is inherent, and namely charity: because charity is that, by which
we cry in our hearts Abba Father. Secondly, because it is said, that the
Spirit lives by reason of justification, though the body be dead by reason of
sin: to both which I have Lib. 3. c. 5.. 5. 6.
before answered.

. XX. But here Bellarmine makes a twofold Adoption; the one Bellarmines two
adoptions.
of the soul, patched out of Romans 8. 10. 15. the other of the body pieced out
of Romans 8. 23. and Phil. 3. 20, 21. when as indeed Adoption is not of either
part, but of the person or of the whole man, who is Adopted to be the son of
God. Neither does the Apostle speak of the adoption of the soul, nor yet of
the adoption of the body, but of the redemption of the body from the servitude
of corruption into the glorious liberty of the sons of God, which is not the
adoption of the body, but the fruit of the adoption of the whole man, which
here by a Metonymy is called adoption. The former he proves by the latter not
to be imputative, but inherent. The adoption of sons which we expect in the
redemption of the body, shall be most true and inherent in the body it self,
that is to say, immortality and impassibility not putative but true: therefore
the adoption which now we have in the spirit by justification, is also true,
not putative but inherent. Ans. In this similitude he should rather have said,
that as the adoption of sons which we do expect at the redemption of our
bodies, that is, at the resurrection, is the everlasting inheritance whereunto
we were adopted as sons, which a true and glorious inheritance, though not
inherent, in the body but enjoyed by the whole man as adherent unto him: so the
adoption which we now have in the Spirit by justification, which is the
entituling of us to this inheritance, is a true adoption, though not inherent,
but wrought by imputation of Christ's merits unto us. But suppose the adoption
of the body as he calls it, were inherent: how does it follow, that the
adoption of the soul, as he calls it, should also be inherent? he says, it
must be so: Otherwise, says he, as we expect the redemption of the body: so
also we should expect the redemption of the soul (which the Papists had need
to do whose souls shall be in purgatory at the last day, but from thence to
be delivered at that day by a gaole-delivery) but I say, it follows not; for
the adoption which is imputative is a most true adoption: and we need no
other, but the accomplishment thereof, which is our full redemption. As for
that adoption, which he supposes to be inherent, it is a mere fancy.

. XXI. Now let us see, what may from that proposition, which As adoption is
imputative, so justification.
was agreed upon between us, be truly inferred on our part. Such as is our
adoption, such is our justification: but our Adoption is imputative, and not by
inherencie. For as I have showed heretofore Lib. ^. c. 1. and lib. 2. c. 6.
these four benefits, reconciliation, redemption, justification and adoption
do not import any real mutation in the subject but relative and imputative:
for when God imputing to a believer the merits of his Son forgiveth his
sins, which made him an enemy to God, a bondslave of sin and Satan, guilty
of sin and damnation, the child of the Devil; and receives him into his
favor, makes him Christ's freeman, accepts of his as righteous, admits
him to be his son: he is said to reconcile, to redeem, to justify, and to
adopt him, not by working any real or positive change in the party, but
relative, or in respect of relation. To be a father, and to be a son are
relatives: when a man therefore has first a son, he becomes a father,
which he was not before, not by any real change in himself, but by a new
relation, which before he had not. When a man is adopted, he becomes the
son of another man, whose son he was not before; not by any real mutation,
but only in regard of relation. For if the party adopted by God should by
adoption be really changed, then God, who adopteth should also seem to be
really changed, which is impossible, because he is immutable. For as he which
is adopted becomes the son of God, which he was not before: so God, when
he first adopteth any man, becomes his father, which he was not before. Here
therefore seems to be a change as well in God adopting, as in the party
adopted: not real, for that is not possible, but relative only, which is a
manifest evidence, that as our Adoption, so our justification is not any real
change wrought in us by infusion of any inherent quality, but a relative change
wrought without us by imputation of Christ's righteousness.

CAP. XI. Bellarmines arguments, proving oblique or indirectly justification De
iustif. l. 2. c. 4.
by inherent righteousness, and first because faith is not the integrall and
only formal cause of justification.
. I.

ANd these were all the arguments, which Bellarmine Bellarmines arguments
proving iudirectly justification by inherent justice
has produced to prove di^ectly his assertion concerning justification by
inherent righteousness: now follow two other ranks, of proofs* whereby he
does oblique, indirectly, and by consequence prove the same; by disproving two
assertions which it pleases him to father upon us. The one, that faith is the
only formal cause of justification; the other, that justification consists
only in remission of sins. For if faith be not the integrall cause formal
of our justification, but that with it charity and other graces do concur,
by which as well as by faith we are justified formally; then it follows, that
we are justified by inherent and habitual righteousness, which consists in
the habits of faith and charity, and other graces. And if justification does
consist, not only in remission of sins, by which our souls are cleansed from
sin, but also in the renewing of us according to Gods image by infusion of
righteousness, by which our souls are not only purged from sin, but also
adorned and beautified with grace; then it follows, that we are justified by
inherent righteousness.

The former question he disputes lib. 2. de justif. c. 4. the title whereof
is, fidem non esse integram formalem caussam justificationis, that faith is not
the whole formal cause of justification. This opinion, he confesses none of
us do now hold, though falsely he would lay it upon Luther Luther only says
that faith (that is, Christ apprehended by faith) is our righteousness, and in
the same sense (...), that faith is in^puted unto righteousness. Bellarmines
allegation of Gal. 5. 5, 6. answered.
and Melancthon; for we deny faith to be the formal cause of justification at
all: and yet this is it, which he, and all of his side evermore object unto us,
to make us odious to the world, as though we required nothing to make us
formally and inherently righteous, but only faith. And for this cause, though
we hold not this assertion, yet he thinks good to confute it, as if we held
it.

. II. Of his proofs, only the first serves to prove, that, with faith,
charity does concur unto justification. It is taken out of Gal. 5. 5. 6. the
fifth verse containing the latter part of the Antithesis between justitiaries
(who were apostates from the doctrine of grace) and the true prosessours of the
Gospel. For the former looked to be justified by the Law, that is, by
obedience performed to the Law, and so were fallen from grace: but the latter
looked not to be justified by the Law, but by faith, that is, by Christ's
righteousness apprehended by faith. Of this Antithesis the latter part agrees
to us; the former, to the Papists And therefore I marvel to what purpose he
alleged the fifth verse, unless it were to confute himself. Now in the sixth
verse the Apostle shows, what manner of faith that is, which justifies; viz.
not a dead or a counterfeit, but a lively and effectual faith: a faith, which
is effectual, or effectually works by love: a faith, which, as Saint James
Iam. 2. 14 ^. His wilful depraving of Gal. 5. 6.
says, is not without works, but is demonstrable by good works.

. III. But these words Bellarmine does wilfully deprave. For in other places
he reads and understands the words as we do, following the vulgar
Latin translation, unto which he is tied by the decree of the Council of
Trent, reading, fides quae per charitatem operatur, faith that works by
charity, as our English Rhemists also translate the words. And to seek no
further, in the very beginning of the next chapter, De iustif l 2. c. 5
where he confuteth the erroneous opinion of Osiander, who held, that the
righteousness of Christ, whereby we are justified, is the essential
righteousness of the Deity dwelling in us: says, that this error is
manifestly refuted by the Apostle, Romans 4. proving the righteousness by which
we are justified, to be faith, vivam, viz. and per dilectionem operantem, to
wit a lively faith and working by love, and likewise, Gal. 5. 5, 6. we by faith
expect the hope of righteousness, for in Christ Jesus neither circumcision
avails any thing, nor uncircumcision, but faith which works by love.
Whereupon he infers, quod si fides per dilectionem operans, etc. but if
faith working by charity be that righteousness etc. But here for a poor
shift, and to serve his present turn, he interprets the Greek Participle
of the middle voice, as if it were passive, fides quae agitur, faith which is
acted, moved, formed, and as it were animated by love. And thereupon infers,
that charity isthe form of faith, and that faith justifies formally, as it is
formed by charity, and not otherwise: and consequently, that charity justifies
much more, and hereupon also he builds afterward that distinction of faith,
that it is either formata, when it is acted by charity; or informis when it is
severed from it: where also to help out the matter, he says that the Latin
word operatur is passively understood (whereof, as I suppose, no example can
be given) thereby making the translation barbarous, and understanding it, as
never any before him understood i^.

IV. But to begin with the last: it were a strange speech, if a man signify,
Bellarmines corrupt interpretation refuted.
that the matter is acted by the form, or that the body is acted by the soul,
should say, corpus per animam operatur. And no doubt, if the old interpreter
had meant so, he would have said agitur and not operatur. As for the G^eeke
word (...), it signifies effectual, or effectually working, and so both the
Verb and the Participle, which are used nine times Romans 7. 5. 2 Cor. 1. 6* 4.
12. Gal. 5 6. Ephesians 3. 20. Col 1. 29. 1 Thessalonians. 2. 13. 2 Thessalonians. ^. 7. Iam. ^. ^6.
at the least in the new Testament, are or ought to be effectual, namely in it
self, or effectual to work according to the twofold (...) or act, whereof
the Philosophers and Schoolmen use to speak; to wit the first and the second,
etc. which distinction may be applied to habits of grace, or gracious habits.
The first act, which is the form of faith, or of any other grace, is that
Tushijah that essence or entity whereof Prove. 3. 21.
Solomon speaks, whereby any grace is that, which it is called (...) indeed
and in truth, which is the integrity of it, and so says Thomas, Summi. 1. q.
48. art. 5.
actus primus est forma and integritas rei, in respect whereof faith, and so
every other grace, is said to be (...) ^ ^im. 1. 5. 2 Timothy 1. 5. Romans 21. 9.
Iam. 3 17.
unfeigned. This is that principium agendi, that inward act or efficacy,
whereby faith or any other grace is effectual in it self, lively, active,
operative, apt to produce operations according to their several kinds, without
which, faith, or any other grace is dead and counterfeit, and not that (...)
indeed and in truth, whereof it bears the name; but aequivoce, even as the
counterfeit of any man is called by his name. The second act of faith or of any
other grace is the actual working thereof, actus secundus, says Thomas Th*
ibid.
est operatio. And these acts are either immediate and eliciti, as the
Schoolmen speak, or mediate and imperati. As for example, the immediate or
elicite acts of justifying faith, are first, to believe truly and effectually
and by a lively assent, that Jesus the Son of the blessed Virgin is the
eternal Son of God, the Messiah and the Savior of all that believe in him.
Secondly, because I so believe in Christ, to believe that he is my Savior.
Thirdly, by these acts, faith receiving Christ, who is our righteousness, does
justify. The mediate acts, which are called imperati, are these acts which the
immediate acts do produce mediantibus aliis virtutibus, by the mediation of
other virtues. For if I believe, that Jesus is the Son of God and the Savior
of all that believe in him, and consequently, that he is my Savior: hereupon,
I shall be moved to trust in him, as my Savior; which is the act of affiance,
but commanded by faith: and to expect salvation from him, which is the act of
hope, but commanded by faith; and likewise to love him, and by love to obey
him, which are the acts of charity, but commanded by faith, as here it is said:
faith working by love. Charity not the form of faith.


. V. Now those graces, by which faith works, as namely charity, have not the
respect of the formal cause unto faith, but rather of the isntrumental:
Neither does faith work by them as its form, but as its instruments; as the
soul by the body and the members thereof. But that charity is not indeed the
form of faith, whereby it is acted and formed, it may appear evidently by
these reasons. First, because those, which hold it to be the form of faith,
deny it to be the inward and intrinsecall form, whereby faith is that which
it is, which only is the formal cause, and as it were the soul of faith; but
extrinsecall, whereby, as they imagine, the acts of faith are informed and so
they make it by a strange kind of Logic, the form of all virtues, as well
as of faith. Secondly, because one habit disparated from another (as the three
Theological virtues, faith, hope, and charity, being also, as themselves say,
seated in diverse subjects, as the seat of faith is the mind, of love the
heart) cannot possibly be the form of the other. Thirdly; that habit, which
proceeds from another, as the fruit and effect thereof, cannot be the form
of that other. But charity, which is the fulfilling of the Law, proceeds from
faith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1. 5. For therefore do we love God, and our neighbor
for his sake, because by faith we are pe^swaded of his love toward us: and
therefore do we love him, because he loved us first, 1 Ioh. 4. 19 Fourthly,
if charity be the form of faith, then faith is the matter of charity; for the
matter is that, which is formed, and as it were animated by the form: but the
consequent is absurd; therefore the antecedent. And again, howsoever faith
works those acts, which I called mediate or imperatos, by means of other
graces, which acts do tend to sanctification, (for which cause, faith does not
sanctify alone): yet the actus eliciti, or immediate acts of faith which are
to believe in Christ, and by believing, to receive, and by receiving him, who
is our righteousness, to justify; faith works neiby charity, nor by any
other grace; and therefore it justifies alone.

. VI. Yea, but without charity, faith is informis, and with it, it is formata.
Of the distinction of faith into (...) and (...).


Answ. This distinction of faith, that it is either formata, or informis in a
right sense may be admitted; as namely, if by form be understood, the
integrity, or inward efficacy; and if that be called formata, which is sound,
unfeigned, lively and effectual; and that informis, which i^ uneffectuall, dead
and counterfeit. For that distinction is intimated by the Apostle, when he
speaks, either of faith unfeigned, or contrariwise of a dead faith, for in the
former, it is employed that there is also a fained and a counterfeit faith: and
in the latter, that there is also a lively faith. And so we admit this
distinction that faith is either

Formata, which is lively and unfeigned. Informis, which is dead and
counterfeit.
But in the popish sense it is to be rejected, and that in three respects.
First, because they propound this distinction, as agreeing to a true justifying
In the popish sense it is to be rejected for three reasons.
faith, as if a true faith might be without form: when as that, which is
without form is dead and counterfeit, and no more to be called a true
justifying faith, than the carcass, or counterfeit of a man is to be called a
man. For howsoever such a faith may perhaps be true in respect of the object,
because it is of the truth: yet it is not true in respect of the integrity,
efficacy, and soundness thereof, and that which is not truly faith, is not
faith (...) or indeed. He that says, either that he believes that there is a
God, Tit. 1. 16.
and in deeds does deny him: and that he is just, and fears not to offend
him; or good, and does not love him; or omnipr^sent and omniscient, and fears
not to play the hypocrite before him etc. such a one does not indeed and in
truth believe that, which he pro^esseth himself to believe. He that says, he
knows Christ, that is, believes in him, and has not a desire and care to
keep 1 John 1. 4
his Commandments, he is a liar, and the truth is not in him. That faith
which is dead and counterfeit cannot justify or save a man, as Saint James
Iam. 2 14.
shows. For howsoever faith alone does justify; yet that faith which is
alone does not justify; neither alone nor at al, becauseit is not a true and
lively, but a dead and counterfeit faith. Neithercan that be a true justifying
faith which is common to the wicked, both men and Angels. Neither may we omit
Bellarmines confession in this place. Here, says he, the Apostle to prevent
occasion of error, explaineth what manner of faith, that is, that justifies,
non quaecunque fides, sed quae per dilectionem operatur, not every faith, but
that which works by love. The second Reason.


. VII. Secondly, this distinction is to be rejected being understood in the
popish sense, wherein it is employed, that charity is the form, and as it were
the soul of faith: which opinion I have already confuted. Neither can they
ground it upon James 2. 26. As the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith
without works is dead. For if the habit of charity cannot be the form of
faith, as I have showed, then much less can good works, which are the outward
fruits both of faith and of charity, be the soul of faith it self. Of the
profession indeed of faith a godly life is, as it were, the soul, and without
which it is dead: but of faith it self it is not anima the soul, but (...),
the breath, as the word (...), being derived from (...), to breath, does
properly fignifie, in which sense it is often used, being called the Spirit of
the mouth, the spirit of the nostrils. And in this sense it may be said, that
as the body without breathing is judged to be dead; so faith without works,
which are as it were the breathing of a lively faith, is also judged to be
dead; not because it ever had lived, but because it wants life.

. VIII. Thirdly, this distinction is to be rejected, because, as The third
Reason.
Bellarmine says, it is to be understood of one and the same faith, which
being informis may become formata; and being formata, may become informis
again, remaining still the same: But fides informis is not of the same kind
with that, which is formata, or justifying faith: as things which be without
life, are not of the same kind with those that are living: or as counterfeits
are not of the same kind with those things which they do resemble. Besides,
justifying faith is divine, the informis is humane: that, infusa, infused and
supernatural; this, acquisita, required by the strength of nature in the use
of means: that, a grace of regeneration proper to the Elect; this, a gift of
illumination only common to the reprobate: that, is vera being truly that
whereof it bears the name; this, simulata, not being that truly which it is
called, but aequivoce: that does so believe in Christ, that it does embrace
him, and wills and desires, at the least, to apply him to the believer:
this, so believes Christ, that either it is joined with horror, as in the
Devils and desperate sinners, or is severed from any will or desire of
application: this, is without fruit and root, and therefore is temporary; that
has both root and fruit, and never fails. And howsoever that which is
informis may by Gods grace be changed into formatam; yet that which is formata
can never be informis. No more than he, who is once borne of God, can be
unborne again.

The rest of his arguments serve to prove, that faith is not the whole formal
cause of justification, that is, as we speak according to the Scriptures, of
sanctification, which we deny not: for we do acknowledge a concurrence of
many graces with faith unto sanctification. As for justification, we deny
faith, either in whole or in part to be the formal cause thereof. Neither
does any other of his arguments prove, that either charity, or any other grace
does with faith concur unto justification.

CAP. XII. That justification does not c^nsist in ren^vation.
. I.

HIs second rank of arguments proving indirectly De iustif. lib. c. 6.
Iustificationem nostram non constare sola remissione peccat^rum.
justification by righteousness inherent is propounded in his sixth Chapter,
the title whereof is this, That o^r justification does not consist in the
remission of sins alone. Neither do we say, it does. The exclusive particle
used by some of our Divines does exclude infusion, not imputation of
righteousness, as ^ib. 2. c. 1.. Joan* Calvin.
Bellarmine confesses. For we do hold (though all perhaps have not so
plainly expressed their meaning and some few have delivered their private
opinions) that remission of sin is but a part of justification: and that by
imputation of Christ's righteousness we are both absolved from our sins, and
also accepted as righteous in Christ and as heirs of eternal life. But
Bellarmine, howsoever he would seem to acknowledge the concurrence of
remission of sin unto justification, yet indeed excludes it. For by
remission of sin concurring to justification, he does not understand the not
imputing or forgiving of sin, but the extinction and abolition thereof,
wrought by the infusion of habitual righteousness, which expels its
contrary, as heat does cold, and light darkness. And howsoever there be duo
termini two terms in this motion or mutation, Transitus a pecca^o ad iustitiam.
as he conceives of justification, as being a passage b or change from sin
to righteousness: yet there be not two causes, nor yet two distinct actions,
but the only cause is justice infused; and the action is but one and the same,
the infusion of righteousness expelling sin. Even as in creation, which is
transit^s a non esse ad esse: in illumination, which is transit^s a tenebris ad
l^cem; in calefaction, which is a passage from cold to heat. But if this be all
that is required in the Popish justification, as undoubtedly it is, the whole
and only form thereof being infused of righteousness, or as they love rather
to speak, righteousness infused, their justification also not differing from
that which the Scriptures call sanctification, saving that they dream of a
total mortification or deletion of sin, and of a perfect renovation: then
what is become of the absolving of ^ ^tom the guilt of sin, by which we are
freed from hell; and the acceptance of us as righteous in Christ, by we are
entitled to the kingdom of heaven? Both which are wrought by imputation of
Christ's righteousness, in which true justification does consist. For infused
righteousness, though it were perfect, could not discharge us from our former
debts; and being unperfect, as their own consciences cannot but tell them, it
cannot entitle them to the kingdom of heaven. Wherefore if they will be saved,
they must of necessity flee to the righteousness or satisfaction of Christ,
who has fully satisfied the Law, both in respect of the penalty, by his
sufferings, and also in regard of the commandment, by his obedience: which
obedience and sufferings, being transient and gone so long since, can no
otherwise be communicated unto them, but by imputation. Now, if they can be
content to acknowledge the imputation of Christ's satisfaction (which sometimes
Bellarm. de iustif. l. 2. c. 7.. quar to etc. 10. Deinde etc. 5.. quar to and.
quod ver^.
they do, and must do if they will be saved; for there is no other means,
either to escape hell, or to come to heaven) then let them, according to the
Scriptures, acknowledge this imputation of Christ's satisfaction, by which they
are to be acquitted and freed from the guilt of sin and damnation, and also
accepted as righteous in Christ, and heirs of eternal life, to be their
justification. As for the mortification of sin, and the renovation of us
according to the image of God in true holiness and righteousness, both which
are but in part, and by degrees wrought in us by the Spirit of regeneration,
let them be acknowledged to be the two parts of our sanctification.

. II. But Bellarmine will needs have our renovation to be the righteousness
Bellarmines. proof, that justification con sisteth in renovation.
of justification. And this he indevoureth to prove by Testimonies of
Scripture, by the authority of Saint Augustine, and by reason. The texts of
Scripture, which he cites, are six. The first, Romans The first Romans 4. 25.
4. 25. who was delivered up for our sin^es, and rose for our justification.
From whence Bellarmine argues thus: to what the Apostle gives the name of
justification, in that justification consists, rather than in that, unto
which he does not give the name: But to renovation in this place the Apostle
does give the name of justification, and not to remission of sin: Therefore
justification consists rather in renovation, than in remission of sin.

Before I answer, I think good to advertise the reader again, that
Bellarmine here by remission of sin does not understand the not imputing of
sin, or as we in plain English call it, forgiveness of sin: but the utter
deletion, the extinction, the total mortification of sin. And that he does
four times at the least signify in this one passage. Now I answer, by denying
his assumption; because the Apostle in this place does give the name of
justification, neither to remission, nor yet to renovation, which is not
mentioned so much as once in all the Chapter. Indeed in some other places the
Apostle and his Disciple Saint Luke do give the name to remission of sins,
that is, to the not imputing of sin, or to the absolving and acquitting from
sin, Romans 4. 6, 7, 8. (...). 13. 38, 39. but never to renovation.

. III. His assumption Bellarmine proves, because it cannot be doubt^d, He
proves his assumption.
but that the Apostles meaning was, that Christ his death was a samplar or
pattern of the death of sin, that is (says he) of remission or deletion of
sins: and that his resurrection was a samplar This is denied by Cardinal
Tolet, in Romans 4. annot. 25* Christ. non est traditus propter de^icta tanquam
examplar, sed tanquam vera satisfactio: igitur nec resurrexisse pro^ ter
iustifi cationem dicitur tanquam exemplar, sed propter ipsum iustificationem,
quem non ess^mus conseca^, nisi surrexisset.
or pattern of our renovation, and inward regeneration, by which we walk in
newness of life. And is this the meaning of the Apostle? Then be like we are
justified by imitation, and not by imputation of Christ's death; and by
imitation of his resurrection, and then also by the same reason we are made
sinners by imitation and not imputation of Adams transgression. But indeed in
this place the Apostle does not propound, by way of exhortation, the death and
resurrection of Christ as an example to be followed in dying to sin, and
rising to righteousness represented in Baptism, as he does in the sixth to
the Romans, where he exhorts to sanctification as an inseparable consequent
and companion of justification: but by way of Doctrine he speaks of the
death and resurrection of Christ, as the cause of our justification, of which
he had spoken in the whole Chapter, and even in the verses next going before:
that righteousness shall be imputed to us, as well as to Abraham, if we
believe in him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead, who was given by
his father and by himself to us and for us, that by the obedience of his life
until death, but especially at his death he might satisfy for our sins: and
was raised from the dead, that we might be justified and saved by his life
which he lives after his death: Christ by his death and obedience did satisfy
for our sins paying a full ransom for them, and so did justify us
meritoriously: and in that sense we are said to be justified by his blood Romans
5. 9. 19.
and by his obedience, both as the matter and merit of our justification. But
neither his death nor obedience had been effectual to our justification, if
he had not risen from the dead. As the Apostle shows 1 Cor. 15* 17. If Christ
be not raised, your faith is vain, ye are yet in your sins. For if Christ
had not risen again, it had been an evid^nce, that he was not the Son of
God: and then could not his obedience or sufferings have been meritorious for
us. But by his resurrection he was Romans 1. 4.
mightily declared to be the Son of God, in regard whereof it was said, Psalm.
2. 7. Heb. 1. 5. Act. 13. 33.
Thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee: and being God, his obedience
and sufferings, are of infinite and all sufficient merit and value, virtue and
efficacy for the justification and salvation of all that believe in him. And
again what benefits Christ merited for us by his obedience even until death,
the same being risen he applies and gives to those that believe. God having
raised him and exalted him Act. 5. 3. 31.
with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Savior, to give repentance to
Israel and remission of sins. Christ therefore was given unto death, that he
might by his sufferings satisfy for our sins the penalty thereunto
belonging: and he did rise again, that by application of his merits we might
be justified. Righteousness therefore shall be imputed to those that believe
in the resurrection of Christ, or rather in Christ raised again: who as he
gave himself to be a (...) or price of ransom for our sins; so he did
arise again, that by effectual application of his merits we might be
justified. So that whom by his death and obedience he redeemed meritoriously,
then he does effectually justify and save by his life Romans 5. 10.
and the several actions thereof, viz. his resurrection, ascension, sitting at
the right hand of his Father as our King and Priest, his coming again to
judgment: who therefore shall lay Romans 8* 33, 34.
any thing to the charge of Gods children? it is God that justifies: who is
he that condemns? It is Christ that dyed, yea rather that is risen again,
who is even at the right hand of God, who also makes intorcession for us?

. IV. In the words following Bellarmine answeareth a secret objection: Whether
ren^ssion and renovation be two distinct actions.
if remission of sins be ascribed to Christ's death: and renovation to his
resurrection, then belike remission and renovation be two several actions
proceeding from diverse causes, contrary to that which has been delivered. For
prevention whereof he says, It is to be noted, that the death of Christ, which
is the price of our redemption, was not only the cause of the remission of
sin, but also of internal renovation. And the like, as he says afterward,
may be said of the re^urrection. For according to the doctrine of the
Catholic Church, these two cannot be severed: f^rasmuch as one and the same
grace (viz. charity,) being through the merit of Christ infused and inherent in
us, does both blot out or extinguish our sins, and also adorneth the soul
with righteousness, wherefore though the Apostle might have ascribed both
remission and renovation, either to Christ's death, or to his resurrection: yet
he chose rather distinctly to attribute remission to his death, and renovation
to his resurrection, propter similitudinem, because of the likeness which the
extinction of sin has with the death of the body: and spiritual renovation
with the resurrection of the body: whereunto I answer briefly; first, that
though the death and resurrection of Christ, in respect of their efficacy,
though remission and renovation always goission and renovation, then in
justification there are two actions proceeding from two causes: secondly, that
these four distinct benefits, remission of sin, and acceptance of us as
righteous in Christ, (which are the parts of justification, wrought both of
them by imputation of Christ's righteousness, which is the one and only form
of justification:) likewise the dying unto sin or mortification, and the
rising of the Sonle from the grave of sin, which is our first resurrection,
or vivification, which are the two parts of sanctification, those four actions
I say proceed from two causes, and that in twofold respects. For remission of
sin is procured by the merit of Christ's death; and dying unto sin is
ascribed to the virtue of his death: the imputation of Christ's merits, whereby
we are both absolved from sin and accepted as righteous, is ascribed to his
resurrection, whereby his merits are applied unto us for our justification; and
the grace of rising from the grave of sin, to the virtue Phil. 3. 9.
of his resurrection: for by the same power, whereby Christ did rise again,
are we raised from sin to newness of life.

. V. His second allegation is Romans 5. 21. That as sin reigned Testimony 2.
Romans 5. 21.
unto death, so grace may reign by justice to life everlasting through Jesus
Christ our Lord: where by justice opposed to sin, he says, is meant inward
renovation. Ans. 1. We deny not, but that in all the faithful there is a two
fold righteousness: the one, imputed, which is the righteousness of
justification: the other, infused and inherent, which is the righteousness of
sanctification, which he calls renovation. If therefore the Apostle did speak
here of righteousness inherent, yet this place would make nothing against us.
For we confess, that as sin reigns in the children of disobedience by
producing the works of iniquity: so the grace of God, or the Spirit of grace
does reign in the faithful by bringing forth the fruits of righteousness. But
this is not the righteousness of justification, but that wherein our
sanctification does consist. But indeed the Apostle here does not speak,
either only, or chiefly, if at all, of inherent righteousness. Neither does
he in this place make an opposition or antithesis between sin and
righteonsnesse, to which supposition Bellarmines argument is grounded; but
between the kingdom of sin reigning unto death; and the kingdom of grace
reigning by righteousness unto everlasting life through Iesns Christ our Lord.
Now the righteousness, wherein the kingdom of grace especially consists, is
the righteousness of justification by faith, whereupon follows peace of
conscience, and joy in the holy Ghost, Romans 14. 17. compared with Romans 5. 1. 2.
which being not our righteousness (as all inherent justice is) but the
righteousness of God, is chiefly, Mat. 6. 33.
yea in the cause of justification is only to be sought after, Phil. 3. 8, 9.
Romans 10. 3. Secondly, as in all the chapter from the twelfth verse to the end,
the opposition which is made is of Adams sin to Christ's obedience: so in this
place, as the sin of Adam was the cause of death, so Christ's obedience, of
life: the opposition is not of inherent righteousness to inherent sin, but
of Christ's righteousness to Adams sin. Testim. 3. Romans 6. 13


. VI. His third allegation is out of Romans 6. 13. Do not ye exhibit your
members as instruments of iniquity unto sin; but exhibit your selves to God,
as of dead men alive, and your members instruments of justice to God; where, by
righteousness, says he, is understood, something that is inherent, etc. and
that he goes about to prove, which no man doubts of, when indeed he should
prove, not, that there is a righteousness inherent in the faithful, for that
we freely confess; but that the righteousness, which is inherent, is that,
by which we are justified. But it is evident, that the Apostle speaks not
here of the righteousness of justification, but of the righteousness of
sanctification, whereunto in this Chapter he does exhort as to a necessary and
unseparable consequent of justification. Neither does the Apostle here, or
elsewhere, (as before I observed in setting down the differences between
justification and sanctification) exhort us to the righteousness of
justification or the parts thereof, which be not our duties, but Gods gracious
favors: for that were to exhort us to remission of sin, and acceptance to
life. But to the righteousness of sanctification, and the parts mortification
and renovation, and to the particular duties thereof, he does, both here and
in many other places exhort, as namely in his sixth testimony cited o^t of Ephesians.
4. 23, 24. from which he would prove (which no man does deny) that our
renova^ion, according to the image of God, stands in righteousness and
holiness inherent.

. VII. His fourth allegation had need to be a good one: for this Testim. 4.
Romans 8. 10.
is the third time that he has cited, and recited, and as it were recocted
it, out of Romans 8. 10. The Spirit lives, because of justification, or as it is
in the Greek, the Spirit is life because of justice. For justification or
justice which makes us to live, and thereby to work, cannot be only
remission of sin, but something inward inherent. Answ. In this place, verse. 10.
11. as I showed before, the Apostle sets down a double privilege of those
in whom Christ dwells by his Spirit, freeing them from the Law of death. The
one, in respect of the soul, verse. 10. that howsoever the body be dead, that
is, (as Bellarmine himself expounds) mortal, or appointed to death by
reason of sin, which the first Adam brought in, and by it death, his sin
being imputed to all: yet the soul, (for so the word Spirit is taken when it
is opposed to the body) is life, that is, as the Antithesis requires, designed
unto life, by reason of that righteousness of the second Adam, by imputation
whereof all the faithful are entitled unto everlasting life, For as in the
former part of the Antithesis is not meant the spiritual death of men dead in
sin, (for that is the death of the soul and not of the body, and the Apostle
speaks of those in whom Christ dwells) but the corporal death, unto which
they also, in whom Christ dwells, are subject: so in the latter is meant, not
the life of grace or of righteousness, but the life of glory. The other
privilege respects the body, verse. 11. that after it has been dead and
turned into dust, the Spirit of him that raised up Christ from death, dwelling
in us shall raise unto life eternal our mortal bodies.

. VIII. His fifth testimony, Gal. 3. 21. where, when the Apostle says Testim.
5. Gal. 3. 21.
If there had been a Law given which could give life, or justify (as the
Rhemists translate the word vivificare) then in very deed, justice should be of
Law: he does plainly (says he) demonstrate, that justice from whence
justification is named, is something, which gives life to the soul, and he
does place the same in motion and action. Answ. If from this proposition
propounded by the Apostle, Bellarmine could have assumed the antecedent that so
he might conclude the consequent: then might he strongly have concluded
against us, that we are justified by inherent righteousness. But seeing the
Apostle does tollere anteceden^, that is, intends to contradict that
antecedent; what reason has Bellarmine to argue as he does? It is very true,
that if the Law could have given us life, that is, as Chrysostom and O^umenius
expound, could have saved us, according to that legal promise, Hocfac and
vives, do this and thou shall live, or as the Rhemists translate, could have
justified us: then undoubtedly we might have been justified by inherent
righteousness. But forasmuch as it was impossible for the Law to justify and
save us, because it neither was, no^ is possible for us, by reason of the
flesh, to perform the condition: and forasmuch as God therefore sent his Son
Romans 8 3, 4.
to perform (...) all that the Law requires unto justification that we, who
could not be justified, nor saved by any inherent righteousness of our own
prescribed in the Law, and therefore not by a justice consisting in our actions
or motions, might be justified and saved by the righteousness of Christ
imputed unto us: what can Bellarmine gather from hence with any show or color
of reason, to prove justification by such a righteousness, as is inherent, and
consists in motion and action?

. IX. The sixth I have already answered with the third. Testim. 6. Ephesians. 4. 23,
24.


As for his testimonies collected out of Augustine, a brief an^were The
testimony of Augustine.
may serve: that he, not considering the force of the Hebrew and Greek words,
which never in all the Scriptures are used in the signification of making
righteous by inherent or infused righteousness: but resting, as it seems,
upon the notation and composition of the Latin word justificare as not
differing in respect thereof from the Verb sanctificare; does sometimes more
largely extend the signification of the word justification, than the Scriptures
use it, as including the benefit of sanctification. But it is a most certain
truth, that the word justificare being used in the Scriptures translated into
Latin as the translation of the Hebrew Hitsdiq and of the Greek (...) must be
understood to signify no other thing (if it be a true translation) than what
is meant by the Hebrew and the Greek; which, as I have showed before, do
never in all the Scriptures signify to make just by infusion of
righteousness. And therefore it cannot be denied, but that it is, and was an
oversight in them, who using the word as mentioned in the Scriptures, and from
thence borrowing it, extend it to another signification, than that of the
original, whereof it is a translation. I say again, as I have said before,
that the fotce of the Latin word, in this controversy, is no further to be
respected, than as it is a translation of the Hebrew and the Greek; and as it
is a true translation, it must be understood no otherwise, than according to
the meaning of the original: if it be understood otherwise, then is it not a
true translation, neither is the sense of the word divine, but humane. Howbeit;
Augustine differs from Bellarmine, as touching the use of this word, in two
things, first, that he does not always so use the word; as for example, when
he teaches, as he, and the rest of the Fathers often do) that we are
justified by faith alone, as hereafter Lib. 6. cap. 9.
shall be showed, they could not mean, that we are sanctified by faith
alone. Secondly, remission of sin, which is the not imputing or forgiving of
sin, is by Augustine included in the signification of the word, which by
Bellarmine is excluded; who, in stead of remission, has substituted the
extinction and abolition of sin. So that although he retain the name, which
he confounds with sanctification: yet the thing thereby signified, which is
the maine benefit, which we receive from Christ, by which we are both
delivered from hell, and entitled to heaven, he has taken away, as I have
heretofore declared. If this answer do not content the Papists, let them
understand; that when the use of any word in the Fathers borrowed from the
Scriptures, differs from the perpetual use thereof in the Scriptures: we
are bound to follow the infall^ble authority of Gods Word, rather than the

never so learned andholy, what is not agreeable to the Scriptures. Talis ego
sum says he, in scriptis aliorum, tales volo esse intellector^s meorum.
Bellarmines reasons. The first.


. X. I come to his reasons, which are three. The first, in every motion, or
mutation there are two termini, a quo, and ad quem, the name being taken from
the latter, as in illumination there is a change from darkness to light; in
calesaction from cold to heat. Iustistcation is a mutation or change,
Therefore in justification there are two termini, a quo, sc. peccatum; ad quem,
justitia, from which it has his denomination, and therefore besides remisston
of sin, there must accrue righteousness. I answer, that mutations are either
real or relative. If he speak of real mutations, I deny the assumption, for
I have proved before, that justification is no such mutation. If he speak of
relative mutations, I grant the syllogism, for even in such there are two
termini, as in liberation, terminus a quo, is bondage, ad quem is freedom, in
marrying, the change is from being a Bachelor to be a Husband, from being a
Maid to be a Wife; so in Reconciliation, Redemption, Adoption; and so also in
justification there is a change from guilt of sin to righteousness imputed:
from being guilty of sin and damnation, to be accepted as righteous unto
life: from being the bondslave of sin and Satan, and obnoxious to hell and
condemnation; to be not only made a freeman but also a Citizen of Heaven. In
all these are great changes, yet not real or positive, whereby any inherent
form, either going before, is abolished, or new acquired; but only relative.

. XI. His second reason may thus be framed: If justification be His second
reason,
given to us of God, not only that we may escape the pains of hell, but
also, that we may obtain the rewards of the heavenly life: then justification
does not consist only in the remission of sins, which only freeth from
punishment; but gives not glory: but the former is true: therefore the latter.
Ans. All this we freely confess: but first, the thing principally intended,
that to justification besides remission of sins renovation concurreth, he
does not go about to prove. Only he proves that justification does not
consist in remission only, in which we agree with him, though not in the
other thing which is to be added; for we add making righteous by imputation;
he, by infusion or renovation. Secondly, the proofs of his assumption we do
not approve. The first, Romans 6. 22. ye have your fruit unto sanctification,
but the end everlasting life. The whole verse is this: But now being made free
from sin and become servants to God, (that is, being redeemed or justified)
ye have your fruit unto holiness (that is, the fruit of your justification is
your sanctification) and the end of both is glorification, or everlasting life.
For this text does neither prove, that justification is not remission of sin
only; not that it is to be confounded with sanctification, which is here made
the fruit of it; nor that it conferreth everlasting life. For if the holy
Ghost, speaking of justification, had mentioned only remission of sin
without mentioning any other thing concurring thereunto (as sometimes he does
Act. 13. 38, 39. 26. 18. Romans 4. 7, 8.) his meaning might be, that being freed
from sin and mancipated (...).
to God, that is, redeemed, (for manu capti and servati are mancipia and servi,
and to be redeemed is to have remission of sins, Ephesians. 1. 7. Col. 1. 14.) ye
have the fruit of your redemption unto sanctification, according to that, Luke
1. 73, 74, 75. and the end both of your redemption and sanctification,
everlasting life, his second proof is Rom, 8. 30, whom he has justified he
has glorified, for so might I say, to whom he has given remission of sins,
to them he gives the inheritance, Act. 26. 18. them he makes blessed, Psalm.
32. 1. them he justifies, Romans 4. 6, 7. Act. 13. 38, 39. and them he
glorifieth. And whereas he says, that in that order of causes set down in
Romans 8. 30.
that place, every latter is the effect of the former, as glorification of
justification, justification of vocation, vocation of predestination: that may
be a reason, why in that serie causarum, sanctification is left out: because
it is not the cause, but the way to glorification, Ephesians. 2. 10. and the
cognizance and character of them that shall be glorified. Act. 20. 32. 26. 18.
his third proof out of 2 Timothy 4. 8. there is a Crown of righteousness laid up
for me, is nothing to the purpose. For as Augustine in Psalm. 100.
says donando delicta fecit se Coronae debitorem, by pardoning offenses he
owes the Crown, and Bernard, Degratiam and lib. arb.
there is a Crown of righteousness, which Paul expects, sed justitiae Dei,
non suae, but of Gods righteousness, not of his, for it is just he should
render what he owes and he owes what he has promised.

. XII. But the assumption, though not proved by him, is approved and granted by
us, as agreeing with that justification, which we teach: and disagreeing from
that, which is taught by the Papists. For we teach that in justification, by
imputation of Christ's righteousness, we are both freed from the guilt of
sin and damnation, and also are in Christ accepted as righteous, and as
heirs of eternal life. And further we teach, that howsoever the parts of
justification, viz. remission of sin and acceptance unto life, in the
faithful; and the causes thereof in Christ, that is to say, his blood and his
obedience, do always concu^re, for whosoever has remission of sins is also
accepted unto life, and contrariwise, and our Savior in his obeying suffered,
and in his sufferings obeyed: yet the causes in Christ, and effects unto the
faithful are to be distinguished. For by imputation of his sufferings
properly we are freed from punishment; and by imputation of his obedience
properly we are entitled to the kingdom of heaven, as I have showed
heretofore. But in the popish justification there is neither remission of
sins properly to free them from hell: nor donation of such ju^tice, as may
entitle them to heaven. For neither the abolition or extinction of sin
present by infusion of righteousness, though it were complete (as it is not)
can satisfy for their former sins, nor can their righteousness, being
unperfect, give them right to heaven. But it is the only satisfaction of
Christ by his righteousness and obedience, both Passive and Active, which
being communicated unto believers by imputation, does both free them from hell,
and gives them a Title and Right to the Heavenly Kingdom. His proof taken
from the courts of men, I admit as good against them, who holding, that we are
justified only by the Passive righteousness of Christ, do make justification
to be nothing else but remission of sins. For they whom being guilty in
themselves (as we all a^e before God) a judge does justify, are freed indeed
from punishment, but they do not thereby obtain new rewards. Howbeit there is
a great dissimilitude between Gods justification of men, and that of humane
Judges. For a judge by his absolution, though he does free the guilty, and
indeed faulty parson from punishment, and from the guilt binding him over to
punishment, and thereby perhaps bewrays his own unjustice: yet he does not
free him from the fault, nor does he make him righteous, and much less does
he indow him with new privileges. But when God does justify a believing
sinner, he does not only free him from hell, and from the guilt binding him
over to condemnation, by imputation of Christ sufferings: but also by
imputation of Christ obedience he makes him righteous and an heir of eternal
life. And in thus justifying a believing sinner, he is just, Romans 5. 26.
because Christ by his sufferings has fully satisfied for his sins, and by
his obedience has merited for him eternal life.

. XIII. His third reason: justification, of enemies makes us Gods His third
reason.
friends, children, beloved Citizens of Heaven, the Domestics of God, heirs
of his kingdom, as the Scriptures every where speak: therefore it does not
stand only in remission of sins, Thus far we agree with him. But as it is
a good argument against those who hold justification to be nothing else but
remission of sin: so it makes not for him, who holds justification by
infusion of righteousness, but against him. For whereas the Scriptures
testify, that God, when he justifies men, he does of enemies make them his
beloved friends, and his children, etc. It is to be confessed, that here is a
very great change: but is it real, or relative? by infusion, or by imputation?
Surely, when God reconcileth men unto himself and of enemies makes them his
favorites; when he adopteth men, and of the children of the devil, makes
them his own children; when justifying men he does of foes make them his
beloved friends, of bondslaves not only freemen, but also Citizens of heaven;
of alients, his Domestics; of men obnoxious to damnation, heirs of his
Kingdom, he does not these things by infusion of any real or positive
qualities into them: but these are external favors, which God vouchsafes
unto them, when forgiving their sins and imputing unto them the
righteousness of his Son, he does in him accept them for such, yea, and in
respect of his relation unto them, makes them such, as before they were not.
And when he has made men such by imputation, he also makes them such by
infusion of such qualities and dispositions, as are answerable to that which
they are called, as I showed in the beginning: whom God receives into his
grace and favor, them he endueth with grace; whom he redeemeth from the
servitude of sin and Satan, he makes them his faithful servants; they, who
are the sons of God by adoption, are also his sons by regeneration, and
finally, those whom God does justify, them also he does sanctify.

. XIV. And this is all which Bellarmine has brought for the Testimonies of
Fathers.
proofs of justification by inherent and infused righteousness, either from
the Scriptures or from natural reason. Afterward indeed in his eighth Chapter
he produces the testimonies of Augustine and some others, which he calleh the
tradition of the ancient Fathers, as if they did agree with the doctrine of the
present Church of Rome; which they do not. For first, though some of the
Latin Fathers, led by the notation of the Latin word, which was not to be
respected, it being bnt the translation of the Hebrew and Greek; did under the
name of justification include the benefit of sanctification, whereof there is
no example in the Scriptures; yet they did not exclude that, which the
Scriptures call justification, as ^the Papists do. For they acknowledged, that
justification contains remission of sins, and that it stands chiefly in
remission of sins; that being our happiness, and therefore implying, besides
the not imputing of sin, acceptance unto life. The Papists also talk of
remission, but their remission is not that, which the Scriptures and Fathers
speak of, for the Scriptures and Fathers and all ancient Writers whatsoever by
remission understand veniam, pardon, condonation, forgiving, not imputing of
sin, absolving from it; which is a distinct action of God from infusion of
righteousness; that, being a work of God without us working no real or
positive change within us: and herein we have the consent of all antiquity.
The Papists by remission of sin understand the expulsion or extinction, the
utter deletion or abolition of sin, which is not a distinct action (as they
teach) from infusion of righteousness, but one and the same action, which is
the infusion of righteousness expelling sin; And is an action of God not
without us as the other, but within us working in us a real and possitive
change. And therefore remission of sin in the Popish sense belongs not to
justification, but to perfect sanctification, as being a total mortification
of sin, which none attain unto in this life: but of this point I have
already treated in the second Lib. 2. c. 6. and 8:
question of the first controversy. Secondly, the fathers oftentimes use the
word justification in the same sense that we do according to the Scriptures,
as implying the forgiveness of sins, and acceptance unto life by the
satisfaction and merits of Christ communicated unto us* As namely when they
teach, as very often they do, that we are justified by faith alone: which they
could not have taught, if by justifying they had meant sanctifying: for we are
not sanctified by faith alone as all confess. Thirdly, the Fathers did not
look to be justified before God by any righteousness inherent in themselves
or performed by them, but renounced it as being unperfect and stained with the
flesh. And therefore where they speak of justification by inherent
righteousness, they meant sanctification: and not justification before God,
whereof our question is. For they profess that by inherent righteousness no
man living can be justified in Gods sight, as I have showed in this third Lib.

sixth.

CAP. XIII. An appendice to this third controversy, concerning the parity of
justice.
. I.

Upon this controversy concerning the matter of The calumniation of the
Papists.
justification depends another; which is scarce worth the mentioning, but
only to show the blinded malice of the Papists in propounding it, and to
vindicate our selves from their calumniations. Bellarmine therefore de justif.
l. 3. c. 16. propounds the question de paritate justitia, of the parity or
equality of justice; whether all just men be in justice equal among
themselves. For feign would he have the world to think, that we are like to
Iovinian, or the Stoiks, calumniating us against the light of his own
conscience. For he cannot be ignorant, but that we do acknowledge degrees of
righteousness inherent and of the graces of sanctification, not only in
diverse men according to the measure of grace bestowed upon them, some being
incipients, some proficients, and some grown men: but also in the same men,
every man being bound to labor, that they may grow in grace, and proceed from
Faith to Faith, until he come to a perfect man in Christ. All the faithful
equal in righteousness i^puted.


. II. Indeed if the question be concerning righteousness imputed, we do
teach, that in respect thereof all the faithful are equally just. Because, as
they are justified, they stand just before God in the most perfect
righteousness of Christ; by which the weak Christian is justified as well as
the strong. And in this regard, the faith of Gods children though unequal in
degrees, in some weaker, in some stronger, in some more, and in some less, is
said by the Apostle 2 Pet. 1. 1.
Peter to be (...), a like precious (...), in the righteousness of God and our
Savior Jesus Christ, that is, in that righteousness of God, by which we are
justified. And as the merit of Christ is equally imputed to all that believe;
so the reward in respect of the substance, which is eternal life, shall be
equally given to all that believe: yet I doubt not, but that whom God in this
life has adomed with greater graces, he will in them crown his greater graces
with greater glory. And therefore as Saint Ambr. lib. 7. in Luc. c. 15. nam and
undecima conducis bora, and eqnalem dignaris mercedem solvere, ^qualem mercedem
vita and grori^,
Ambrose faith, he gives ^qualem mercedem vitae, ^on gloriae, the equal
reward of life, but not of glory: and Adv. Jovin. lib. 2.
(...) unus denarius non est unum pr^mium, sed una vita, and una de g^enna
liber^tio: and Moral. l. 4. c. 42. quia una cunctis erit beatitudo laetitiae,
quamvis non una sit omnibus sublimitas vit^. Bellarmines proof impertinent:
Gregory there be many mansions with the father, and yet unequal laborers
receive the same penny, because unto all there shall be one equal blesseduesse
of joyfulnesse, though the sublimity of life be not one and the same to all.

. III. But Bellarmine, though he confesses, that we do not hold, that either
virtues, or sins are equal, and that we do not deny, but that both the same
men may and ought to increase, in faith, hope, and charity, and in other
virtues: and that also diverse men may be more just than others in respect of
such virtues as be in them; but that we hold, that men being not justified
before God by these virtues, but only by the righteousness of Christ
apprehended by faith, we are in respect of this righteousness, by which we
are justified, equally just. Yet all his proofs are to prove the inequality
and degrees of sanctity or inherent righteousness; as though we denied the
same, or held that paradox, which may in respect of habitual righteousness
more justly be imputed to the Papists. For if incipients in Religion, yea,
infants in age, be justified or made just, as they teach, with perfect
righteousness infused, what difference shall there be betwixt Baptized
infants and the greatest Proficients among them (who dream of perfection) in
regard of habitual righteousness? saving that the infants justice may seem
to be more pure from actual concupiscences. But of this question more has
been said than enough.

A TREATISE OF JUSTIFICATION.
THE FIFTH BOOK: Concerning the formal cause of justification.
CAP. I. Containing five proofs, that we are justified by imputation of
Christ's righteousness.
. I.

THE fourth grand error of the Papists in the article The state of the
controversy.
of justification, is concerning that, which we call the form thereof. For
they denying, and deriding the imputation of Christ's righteousness (without
which notwithstanding no man can be saved) do hold, that men are justified by
infusion, and not by imputation of righteousness: we on the contrary do hold,
according to the Scriptures, that we are justified before God only by
imputation of Christ's righteousness, and not by infusion. And our meaning when
we say, that God imputes Christ's righteousness unto us, is nothing else but
this; that he graciously accepts for us, and in our behalf the
righteousness of Christ, both active, that is, his obedience, which in the
days of his flesh he performed for us; and passive, that is, his sufferings,
which he sustained for us, as if we had in our own persons both performed and
suffered the same for our selves. Howbeit we confess, that the Lord does
infuse righteousness into the faithful; yet not as he justifies; but as he
sanctifies them: and consequently we acknowledge, that in all the faithful
there is true righteousness inherent, but we deny that they are justified by
it. How I am first to prove our assertion, and to maintain our proofs against
the exceptions and cavils of the Papists; And then will I answer their
allegations.

. II. My three first proofs shall be taken from those things, The three first
proofs.
which have already been proved. And first, those reasons, which before The
first.
Lib. 1. c. 3.. 7, 8, 9, 10. etc. 9.
I alleged to prove the formal cause of our justification, to be the
imputation of Christ's righteousness.

Secondly, If to justify in the Scriptures does never signify to make
righteous by infusion of righteousness: or to make a man righteous formally by
inherent righteousness: then it is evident, that the justification, which the
Scriptures teach, is not by infusion of righteousness. And if not by infusion,
then by imputation; for a third thing cannot be named. But the former I have
Lib. 2.
most evidently proved; therefore the latter cannot be denied.

Thirdly, If we be justified by the righteousness of Christ, which is out of
us in him, and not by any righteousness infused or inherent in us: then it is
evident, that we are justified, not by infusion of righteousness, but by
imputation. But the former I Lib. 4.
have fully demonstrated: therefore the latter must be confessed. For we are
justified, either by inherent righteousness, or imputed, not by inherent, as
has been showed, therefore by righteousness imputed. The fourth imputation
of Christ's satisfaction confessed by the Papists.


. III. My fourth proof shall be taken from the confession of our Adversaries:
who do confess Bellarm. de iustif. l. 2. c. 7.. quarto etc. 10.. Deinde etc.
11.. potest. Stapleton de iustif. etc.
that Christ his satisfaction is imputed unto us; which they understand but of
the one half of his satisfaction, and not all that, viz. in respect only of
the everlasting punishment, and the guilt of eternal death. As for the
temporal punishment, which they say remains after absolution from the
eternal, they must satisfy otherwise. And as for satisfaction to the
commandments, the performance whereof is the condition of the legal promise
Do this and live, by which performance Christ merited for us eternal life:
they say, that Christ's satisfaction and merit is not imputed, but we our
selves are to merit eternal life. But by the same reason, whereby they have
been forced to acknowledge the necessity of that part of Christ's satisfaction
made by his sufferings to be imputed to free us from hell, they shall be
compelled to confess the necessity of the imputation of the other part of his
satisfaction, which is his obedience to be imputed to us, to merit heaven for
us. The reason, why of necessity Christ's satisfaction by his death and
sufferings must be imputed to us to free us from hell, is this: because nothing
can satisfy for our sins which infinitely offend God and deserve an infinite
punishment, but that only which is of infinite value. By the same reason,
nothing can give us right and title to the kingdom of heaven, which is no
less an infinite reward, being the eternal fruition of the infinite good (for
God as he gave his Son in pretium, so he has reserved himself in pr^mium)
but that only which is of infinite worth and value; and that is only the
merit of Christ who is Ier. 23. 6.
Jehovah our righteousness. The fifth proof out of 2 Cor. 5. 21.


. IIII. My fifth proof shall be taken out of that most pregnant place, and
most worthy to be insisted upon, 2 Cor. 5. 21. Him ( viz. Christ the just) who
knew no sin, God made sin for us; that we (who are sinners in our selves)
might be made the righteousness of God in him. Where these two words sin,
and righteousness need some explanation. But the explication of the latter,
will clear the former. There being a fit analogy between Christ's being made
sin, and our being made righteousness. But it is evident, that we are said
to be made righteousness, in the abstract, when we are made righteous in the
concrete. And therefore by analogy, when Christ is said to be made sin for
us, the meaning is, that he was made a sinner for us. Some, because it seems
an harsh speech to call Christ a sinner (though not so harsh, when it is said
withal, that he was without sin) do rather by sin understand a sacrifice
for sin, as the word sin sometimes is taken, which I acknowledge to be a
godly sense; but not so agreeable to the analogy, which is between the parts
of this text. From this analogy I argue thus.

As Christ the righteous, who was without sin, was made sin, that is to
say, a sinner for us, or if you will, a sacrifice for sin in our behalf; so
we who are sinners in our selves, are made the righteousness of God in him,
that is, righteous in Christ by his righteousness:

But Christ, who was and is most just, was made a sinner, or a sacrifice of
sin for us by imputation of our sins unto him:

Therefore we who are sinners in our selves, are made righteous before God, by
imputation of Christ's righteousness unto us: which is therefore called Gods
righteousness, because it is the righteousness of him who is God.

. V. Against both the premises, the Papists cavil diversely. Doctor Popish
e^vils against the proposition
Bishop writing against Master Perkins, shuts his eyes against the truth,
saying, that there is not in this text any similitude employed between Christ's
being made sin, and our being made just: and so denies the proposition as
containing this comparison: that we are so made the righteousness of God in
Christ, as he was made sin for us. But this analogy is acknowledged by their
Saint Anselme of Canterbury writing upon this text: whom when Master Perkins
Reform cathol^ art, 4.
alleged, as expounding these words f. Anselm. in locum.
and recited his exposition; all Bishops answer is, that Anselme shall be
answered when the place is quoted: when as Master Perkins, not only quoteth
him, as expounding the place, Qui non noverat peccatum per experinnti^, licet
nosset illud per (...) ided fecit ^um peccatum nos efficeratur iustiti^ Dei in
ips^. Ipse ergo peccatum, (...) nos iustitia: nec n^stra sed Dei, nec in nobis
sed in ipso: sicut ips^ peccatum, non suum sed nostra, nec inse, sed in ^obis,
etc.
but also cites his words. He is made sin, as we are made justice, not ours,
but Gods; not in us, but in him: as he is made sin, not his own, but ours;
not in himself but in us: which words he borrowed from Saint Augustine, who
saith^ (...) (...) Quaerent. c. 41.
ipse ergo peccatum, ut n^s justitia; nec nostra, sed Dei, nec in nobis sed in
ipso: sicut ipse peccatum, non suum, sed nostrum; nec in se, sed in nobis, etc,
Both of them plainly expressing this analogy, that Christ was sin as we are
righteousness, not ours but Gods, no^ in our selves but in him: even as he
was made sin, not his, but ours, nor in himself but in us: which analogy
being granted, as it cannot be denied, ^ Christ (...) pro (...) nostris (...),
peccati nomen accep^, (...) (...) efficere^ (...) Dei in ipso, non nostra nec
in nobis.
does invincibly prove, that as Christ was made sin by imputation of our
sin; so we are justified not by any righteousness of ours, but by
imputation of Gods righteousness, that is, of Christ who is God, and that not
in us, but in him. And so Hierome also expounds this place: Christ h being
offered for our sins, received the name of sin, that we might be made the
justice of God in him, not our own, nor in our selves. And Sedulius, that we
might be made the righteousness of God not ours, nor in our selves, but in
him, that is, in Christ, as the members in the head: And Augustine again, all
(...). in Joan. (...). 3 Omnes qui per Christum iustisicati, iusti, non ^n se,
sed in illo.
that are justified by Christ, are just, not in themselves, but in him. Their
second cavil.


. VI. Secondly, they cavil at our exposition of those words both in the
proposition and assumption, him who knew no sin, he made sin that is, a
sinner for us: for first, Bellarmine, De iustif. l. ^. c. 10.
though our sins, says he, were imputed unto Christ, and his satisfaction
to us: yet neither would it follow, that he was thereby made a sinner, nor we
righteous. For our sins are imputed to him, not as though he had committed
them, or could be held unjust: But they are only imputed to him in respect of
the due debt of satisfying, which he willingly undertook: for which he
deserves not to be called a sinner, but righteous, for he that satisfies
for another is most just. So therefore his righteousness is also imputed to us
quoad satisfactionem, so far sorth as it is a satisfaction which he
performed for us. But not therefore can we be held just, that is clean and
without spot, if the spots and defilements of sin be truly inherent in us.

Answ. How could our sins be imputed unto Christ, and he not be counted a
sinner? and how could his satisfaction whereby he fully satisfied both the
Commandment by obeying, and the penalty by suffering, be imputed unto us, and
we not reputed righteous? For by imputation, as our sins were made his: so
his righteousness was made ours. And as for and by our sins he was
condemned, as if he had been a debtour, that is, a sinner; because as our
surety he voluntarily undertook our debt: so by and for his satisfaction,
which he performed for us, and which the Lord accepts in our behalf, as if
we had performed the same in our own persons, we are justified. And yet
though our sins being imputed to him, he was reputed and as it were made a
sinner; and though his righteousness being imputed to us we are made
righteous in him: yet this hinders not, but that he in himself was just, and
we in our selves sinners. Yea, this argues, Testimonies of Fathers that
Christ was made a sinner for us.
that he in himself was just, and we in our selves, sinners.

. VII. Now that Christ was made a sinner for us, that is, was condemned and
crucified, as if he had been a sinner, the Greek expositours with one
consent do teach. Chrysostom (...).
him that knew no sin, says the Apostle, him who was righteousness it self,
he made sin, that is, he suffered him to be condemned as a sinner, and to dye
as one accursed, and again more plainly: for (...).
him that was righteous says the Apostle, he made a sinner, that those which
be sinners he might make righteous. But, says he, the Apostle says more:
him, he made sin, and us, he made righteous. The like have (...).
Decumenius, his Son being righteousness and holiness, he made sin, that
is, he suffered him to be crucified as a sinner, and as a guilty person: and
again he made sin, that is, to be condemned (...).
as a sinner: and elsewhere, In Heb. 9. verse. vlt. (...).
very plainly for now the father sent him making him sin: for Christ was
very much a sinner, as having (...) upon him the sins ^f the whole world, and
^ade them his own -- for that Christ was a sinner, here (says he) him that
knew no sin ^e made sin for us, that were in very deed sin. And also
Theophylact: his Son who knew not sin, that is, who himself was
righteousness, he made to dye for us, as if he had been a sinner and
malefactor. For Deuteronomy. 21. 23.
cursed, says he, is he who hangs on a tree: and he was Esai. 53. 12. Mark.
15. 28.
numbered among the transgressors. Theodoret likewise, being free from sin,
he did undergo the death of sinners, that he might take away the sin of
men: and being called that, which we are, (that is, a sinner) he made us that
which he was, (that is, righteous) To the like purpose August. in Psalm. 21.
Quorum delictorum? de quo dictum est, qui peccatum non fecit, non inventus est
do us in ore eius? quomodo erg^ dicit delictorum ^eorum? nisi quia pro delictis
nostris ipse precatur, and delicta nostra sua delicta fecit, ut iustitiam su^m
nostram iustitiam faceret.
Augustine interpreting those words of Psalm 22. verse. 1. according to the
translation of the Septuagints and the vulgar Latin, verba delictorum meorum
the words of my sins; of what sins? says he, of whom it is said, that he
did no sin, neither was any guile found in his mouth? how then does he say,
of my sins? but that he prays for our sins, and our sins he has made
his own sins, that his righteousness he might make our righteousness.
Hier. in Psalm. 21: Idem in Psalm. 37. 19. quem iniquitatem m^m sicut n.
maledictioni subiacent, ut nos a maledicto legis erueret, ita and peccatorem se
(...) qui pecc^ nostra portavit.
Hierome upon the same words: Verb^ delictorum meor^: quia nostra pecc^ta sua
reputat, he says the words of my sin, because our sins he reputeth to be
his own: and again on those words Psalm. 38. 7. because mine iniquity] for ^s
he was made subject to the curse, that he might deliver us from the curse of
the Law; so he professes himself a sinner, who bare our sins, and on these
words, Cogitab^ pro pecca^ meo] Christ's sins are the sins of mankind:
Peccata Christi, humani delicta sunt generis.

VIII. Thirdly, Bishop and other Papists commonly, by sin in this place
understand a sacrifice for sin, according to the interpretation of some of
the ancient, acknowledged by Oecumeni^s, in which sense not only the word
Ascham is often used as Levi^. 5. 6. 16. 18, 19. 7. 1, 2. Numb. 5. 7. but also
Chattath, Exodus 30. 10. Levit. 7. 7. 37. Levit. 4. 3. 8. 14. 20. 24. 9. 7.
Ezekiel. 44. 27. 45. 19. 23. Hos. 4. 8. they The third cavil.
eat the sin of my people.

Answer. This exposition makes wholly for us: For if God did make Christ a
sacrifice for sin, he imputed our sins unto him, or as the Prophet Esaias
speaks, he laid Posuit in eo vulg. lat.
on him the iniquity of us all, Esai. 53. 6. Neither can it be conceived, how
he should be made a sacrifice for our sin, unless our sin were imputed
unto him. In sacrifices for sin (all which were types of Christ his
sacrifice) the manner was, that the party who offered the sacrifice for sin
should Levit. 1. 4. 4. 4. 15. 24. 29. Exodus, 29. 10. 15.
lay his hand upon the head of the sacrifice, the meaning of which ceremony is
fully explained. Lev. 16. 21, 22. Where Aaron is required, in the name of all
the Congregation, to lay his hands upon the head of the Scapegoat, (which the
Hebrews call Azazel, the Greeks (...), the Latins Emissarium) and confess
over him all the iniquities of the children of Israel, and all their
transgressions in all their sins, putting them upon the head of the Goat --
and the Goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities. So it is said of our
Savior Christ, Esaias 53. 6. 10, 11, 12.
that when his soul shall be made an offering for sin, the Lord would lay
upon him the iniquities of us all, and that he should 1 Pet. 2. 24.
bear our sins. And as our sins are imputed to him, so his sufferings are
imputed to us, and accepted for us, and in our behalf, as a full satisfaction
and propitiation for our sins, Ephesians. 5. 2. 1 Ioh. 2. 2. which is also said
Levit. 4. 20. 25. 35.
of those Sacrifices which were but types and figures of his sacrifice, Levit.
1. 4. and whereas Bellarmine says, that we cannot by Christ's satisfaction
imputed to us be accounted just, that is, says he, clean and without spot,
if the spots and defilements of sin be truly inherent in us: I answer: If
none be justified in whom remain any spots of sin, then no mortal man is
justified. But as Christ was reputed a sinner and was punished as a sinner,
because our sin, that is, our debt, which he as our surety undertook, was
imputed to him, though in him was no spot of sin: even so we are by Christ's
satisfaction imputed to us, reputed and rewarded as just, and that by such a
justice, in which, as Chrysostom says, there is no spot or blemish, and is
therefore called Gods righteousness, though in us do remain some spots and
blemishes of sin. For here it is said, not that we are made righteous, but
righteousness, yea Gods righteousness, and that not in our selves but in him.
For that is Gods righteousness when we are not justified by works (that is by
righteousness inherent) seeing it is necessary that no spot be found, as
(...) etc.
Chrysostom says. The like have Oecumenius, and Theophylact. He did not say,
that we might be made righteous (says Oecumenius) but righteousness it self
which is more, and the righteousness of God. Now Gods righteousness is, to
be justified, not by works, (...), but by indulgence in him and by him.

. IX. Bellarmine having rejected our exposition, which is indeed Bellarmines
triple exposition of this place. The first.
the exposition of the Fathers, as has been showed: he says, it may be
expounded three ways, first, that by the righteousness of God in this place,
we understand the divine justice, which is in Christ: which we willingly
embrace, as a confession of that truth, which we profess. For by these words
he must understand, either the essential and uncreated justice of the Deity
in Christ, or the righteousness of our Mediator the 1 Timothy 2. 5.
man Christ; which notwithstanding is called the righteousness of God, because
it is the righteousness of that person, who is God; which righteousness,
says he, we are said to be, not in our selves, but in him, because he is our
head: or as Sedulius before expounded those words in him, Quasi membra in
capite, as members in the head. Not that either we are formally just, says
Bellarmine, by Christ's righteousness, or Christ formally a si^ner by our
iniquity, but because we are his members. For there is such a communion
between the head and the members, that the righteousness of the head is
imputed to the members, and the sin of the members to the he^d, as appears
also by the places alleged by Bellarmine, Esaias 53. 6. posuit in e^ iniquitatem
omnium nost^um Esai. 53. 6.
he laid upon him, (that is, he imputed unto him) the iniquity of us all, and
Psalm. ^1. Christ himself says, far from my health are the words Psvl. 22. 1.
delictorum meorum, of mine offenses. Here therefore the Reader is to observe a
double confession, which the evidence of truth has wrung from Bellarmine. For,
as in the next precedent section, he confessed the satisfaction of Christ to
be imputed to us: so here he acknowledges, that we are the righteousness
of God, which is in Christ, as being the members of that body whereof he is
the head, and consequently partakers of that righteousness which is in him:
which therefore he calls divine or Gods righteousness, because the person
whose righteousness it is, is God. Bellarmines second exposition.


. X. His second exposition is, that by the righteousness of God is understood
righteousness inherent in us, which is called Gods, because it is given us of
God. But this exposition cannot stand, because the righteousness of Godof
which the Apostle speaks, is neither ours, but Gods; nor in us, in Christ, as
the Fathers have testified. But inherent righteousness, but though bestowed of
God (as all other good things which we have received from God) is ours, and not
inherent in Christ but in ourselves: for as the parts of inherent
righteousness, or sanctification, though given of God are said to be ours, 1 Thessalonians 3. 6.
as our faith, our hope, our charity, so the whole righteousness which is
inherent in us, or sanctification, is called h Lib. 4. cap. 2.. 3.
ours, as I have showed heretofore ^. Neither are we in this place called
righteousness, in respect of righteonsnesse inherent: no more then Christ is
called sin, in respect of any inherent sinnefulnesse. Neither are we by Gods
righteousness said to be righteous in our selves but in Christ. Neither does
Saint Chrysostom, whom he cites, understand this place of righteousness
inherent, as though such a perfect righteousness inherent were given by Christ
in this life, as that in the justified no spot of sin were left, as
Bellarmine dreameth: for the contrary is rather to be gathered from the words
of Chrysostom. For it is Gods righteousness, says he, when we are
justified, not of works (that is, not by righteousness inherent:) and why so?
because in that righteousness by which we are justified, there may no spot
be found: noting, as I understand him, that in our works and in our inherent
righteousness spots are to be fouud: whereas that justice, in respect whereof
we are said to be the righteousness of God in Christ, is without spot.
Bellormines third ^position.


. XI. His third exposition, that by righteousness of God is meant inherent
righteousness; which is so called, because it is the image of Gods
righteousness. For as Christ by a trope is called sin, because he took the
similitude of sinful flesh, that he might becometa sacrifice for sin: so
we by a trope are called Gods righteousness, because our righteousness
inherent is like the justice of God. And hereupon he infers, that as Christ
truly and not imputatively took the likeness of sinful flesh, and truly and
not imputatively was made a sacrifice for sin: so we not imputatively, but
truly are made righteous in our justification by righteousness inherent.
Answer, In this discourse nothing is sound, nothing almost worth the
answering. For first, in the Scriptures there is an Antithesis Romans 10. 3.
Phil. 3. 8, 9.
betwixt our righteousness and Gods righteousness in the question of
justification: but our righteousness is that, which is inherent: Gods
righteousness is that, which is out of us in Christ. Secondly, by inherent
righteousness we are righteous in our selves; but by the righteousness of
God, we are righteous, not in our selves but in Christ. Thirdly, if by a trope
we are said to be righteousness, as Christ by a trope was said to be sin:
undoubtedly it is to be understood of the same trope, which is a metonymy, the
abstract being put for the concrete. Neither is there the like trope of Christ
being called sin, and of us being called the righteousness of God in him, if
by sin in this place be meant a sacrifice for sin. Fourthly, neither is it
true, either that Christ in this place is called sin, because he took upon
him the similitude of sinful flesh; as though the Apostle compared our
justification, whereby we become righteous, to Christ's incarnation, wherein he
took upon him our nature; and not to his condemnation, wherein he took upon
him our sin: or that we are called the righteousness of God in Christ,
because we have some likeness of his justice: neither would it follow from
hence, that we in our s^lves are just; unless it should follow also, which
were blasphemous to aver, that Christ in himself was a sinner. For so are we
made righteous, as h^e was made sin. Fifthly, neither is that true, that
Christ was not made a sacrifice by imputation. For when he was made a sacrifice
for us, our sin was laid upon him, and imputed to him, as has been said;
that his righteousness in like manner, might be imputed to us.

CAP. II. Containing eight other proofs that we are justified by impu^ation
of Christ's righteousness.
. I.

MY sixth proof shall be out of Romans 5. 19. As by Our sixth argument out of
Romans 5. 19.
the first Adams disobedience, which we call his fall, we were made sinners,
that is guilty of sin and obnoxious to death and damnation: so by the
obedience of the second Adam we are made just or justified, that is acquitted
from our sin and condemnation, and accepted in Christ as righteous unto life.

But we were made sinners by imputation of Adams disobedience; Therefore by
imputation of Christ obedience we are justified. The proposition is the
Apostles. The assumption is in diverse places confessed by De amiss. grati^ and
statu pet. l. 4. c. 10. and l. 5. c. 17. and 18.
Bellarmine as I have showed Lib. 4. (...).
heretofore, though sometimes to serve his present turn he do deny it. But it
is easily proved: For if both the guilt of Adams sin be communicated unto us,
and also the punishment thereof be inflicted upon us, which is both our
original corruption, and death it self besides many other calamityes, then is
it to be presupposed that the sin it self is imputed to us. For if the sin it
self had not been imputed, then as Bellarmine himself somewhere argues De
Amiss. gr. lib. 5. c. 18.
, neither the guilt, nor the corruption had belonged unto us. Again, things
that are transient, when they are once past and gone, cannot be communicated
otherwise than by imputation. That transgression of Adam, as all other actions
was transient, and therefore if it be demanded how it being so long past and
gone can be communicated to us, Bellarmine truly answeareth, it is
communicated unto us by generation, eo modo quo communicari potest id quod
transiit, nimir^m per imputationem: in that manner according to which that may
be communicated which is transient and gone, to wit, by imputation. If it be
objected (which was Bellarmi^es prime argument for inherent righteousness)
that through the disobedience of the first Adam we were made sinners, by
inherent unjustice: and therefore by the like reason through the obedience of
the second Adam we are made just by righteousness inherent. I answer, that
from Christ we have both 1 Cor. 1. 30.
justification and sanctification, the former answering to the guilt of Adams
transgression imputed, the latter answerable to the original corruption by
generation derived, but though we have them both from Christ, yet not after
one manner: the former we have by imputation, the latter by infusion. But of
this place I have spoken heretofore at large. Arg. 7. The justification of a
sinner is imputative.


. II. Our seventh argument. Whosoever is a sinner in himself, and so
continues whiles he remains in this life, cannot be justified otherwise
than by imputation. This I take to be a most certain and undeniable truth.

But every many whatsoever (Christ only excepted) is in himself a sinner, and
so continues, whiles he remains in this life:

Therefore no man whatsoever can othervise be justified but by imputation.

Or thus; The justification of a sinner is imputative, for to a sinner the Lord
when he justifies him, imputing not sin, imputes righteousness without
works, Romans 4. 6. 8. The justification of Romans 4. 5.
every Christian is the justification of a sinner, and so is called of all
writers, both old and new, both Protestants and Papists.

Therefore the justification of every Christian is imputative.

The assumption of the former syllogism is denied by the Papists, but against
the testimony of their own Conscience, and against the common experience of
all men, in all times and places. But this I prove it briefly. All that
sometimes do sin, or have sin abiding in them, are sinners, all men
sometimes do sin, and have sin remaining in them, therefore all men are
sinners, the assumption is proved by James the just, and by the holy beloved
Apostle; including themselves in many Iam. 3. 2.
things we offend all of us, and if we say, we have no sin 1 Ioh. 1. 8.
we deceive our selves and there is no truth in us. But that all mortal men
are sinners, I have sufficiently proved before Lib. 4. c. 2.. 6.
. Unless therefore the Papists will say, they are no sinners, and that in them
there is no sin (which if they do say, we may be bold to tell 1 Ioh. 1. 8.
10.
them that there is no truth in them) they must confess justification by
imputation of Christ's righteousness.

. III. Our eigth argument: To whom faith is imputed unto Arg 8. Because faith
is imputed unto righteousness.
righteousness, without works, he is not justified by works, that is, by
righteousness inherent, but by imputation of Christ's righteousness.

To Abraham and all the faithful faith is imputed unto righteousness without
works:

Therefore they are not justified by works, but by imputation of Christ's
righteousness.

The former part of the proposition is proved by opposition of faith to works
in the question of justific^tion, and by the testimony of the the Apostle, Romans
4. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8. The latter part is proved by the former: for if not by
inherent righteousness, then by imputed: and if by faith and yet not by
inherent righteousness, then not by faith in respect o^ it self, as it is an
habit inherent in us, but in respect of the object, which it apprehends. Of
which that is verified properly, (which by a trope, viz. a Metonimy, is
ascribed to faith: namely, that it justifies and saves, that by it we have
remission of sin, and the inheritance, etc. that is, Christ received by faith
does justify and save, etc.

The assumption in exp^esse terms is delivered, Romans 4. 3. 5, 6. 22, 23

Here Bellarmine confesses, that faith indeed is imputed unto righteousness,
and that is our righteousness (which confession does not well agree with his
assertions elsewhere, that faith does but dispose unto justification, and that
our formal righteousness is our charity, that faith is an habit of the
Understanding, but justice is an habit of the Will) But our gloss he does not
allow; when we say, by faith, that is, by Christ's righteousness apprehended
by faith, because it is repugnant to the Apostle for two causes. For first he
does not say, Christ's righteousness; but faith is imputed. Now faith is not
Christ's righteousness, but ours by Gods gift. Which notwithstanding is the
maine doctrine of the Gospel, Romans 1. 17.
revealing the righteousness of God, that is, of Christ, who is God, from
faith to faith, the righteousness Romans 3. 21, ^.
of God by faith, that is, which is apprehended by faith. For faith it self is
not the righteousness of God which does justify or save us, but the
instrument to receive Gods righteousness: and therefore does not justify or
save properly, but relatively in respect of the object which it does receive,
that is to say, the righteousness of Christ, which does justify and save
those which receive it by faith: and therefore when it is said in the Gospel
more than once, thy faith has saved thee, the meaning is, that Christ received
by faith has saved those which did believe in him, Act. 3. 16 it is said that
faith in Christ had cured the lame man, but it is thus to be understood, that
the name of Christ, by faith in his name did cure him. For we are justified and
saved by a perfect righteousness, which is of infinite value and merit, which
is, not faith nor any other grace or graces inherent, but only the
righteousness of Christ. And yet because by faith we are united to Christ,
and by it are made partakers of his benefits; therefore all the benefits which
we receive from Christ are attributed to faith, as elsewhere I have showed: To
faith, metonimically: but properly to Christ himself. His second reason:
because the word imputare in this place, does not signify a bare reputing, but
a reputing unto which the truth is answer able in the thing it self, as is
plain by these words, Romans 4. 4.
Ei qui operatur, merces imputatur, etc. for it is certain, that to him that
works, not only in opinion and conceit, but truly and indeed the reward is
due. Answ. This reason does not prove our gloss to be repugnant to the
Apostle, unless he imagine, that we hold the imputation of Christ's
righteousness to a believer to be not real, but imaginary. And then by the
same reason let him say, that the imputation of our sins to Christ, for which
he really suffered and the imputation of Adams transgression to his posterity
for which they are really punished, was but imaginary. Howbeit there is a
difference in the manner of imputing a reward to him that works, and of
righteousness to him that believes for that, is ex debito: this ex gratia.

. IV. Our ninth argument; He that is justified not by his own righteousness
but by the righteousness of another, is justified by righteousness imputed.
But all the faithful are justified not by their own righteousness, Phil. 3.
8, 9. Romans 10. 3. but by the righteousness of another, this was fully proved
and maintained in the whole third controversy: for that which is but one man's
righteousness cannot be every faithful man's own by inherencie, but only by
imputation. The righteousness by which we are justified is but the
righteousness of one, Romans 5. 18, 19.

. V. Our tenth argument. There is the same matter whereby infants are justified
and others. But infants are not justified by righteousness inherent: for
neither have they habitual righteousness, which consists in the habits of
faith, hope, and charity, of which they are not capable, whiles they want the
use of reason: nor actual, as all confess, but by the righteousness of
Christ, and that imputed. And therefore Ber^d ^n Cant: s^rm 58.
says, they want no merits, because they have the merits of Christ.

. VI. Our eleventh argument. As Abraham was justified; so are we, Romans 4. 23,
24.

Abraham was justified by imputation, Romans 4. 3. 22. and not by inherent
righteousness, though he did excel therein:

Therefore we are justified by imputation, and not by inherent righteousness.

. VII. Our twelfth argument: To those that are justified by faith
righteousness in their justification is imputed without works, that is,
without respect of righteousness inher^nt, Romans 4. 5, 6.

All the faithful are justified by faith Esai. 53. 11. Romans 3. 28. Gal. 2. 16.

Therefore to all the faithful in their justification righteousness is
imputed without respect of inherent righteousness.

. VIII. Our thirteenth argument: whose sins are remitted by imputation of
Christ's satisfaction unto them, they are justified by imputation: for to be
absolved from sin is to be justified, Act. 13. 38, 39. where to have
remission of sin is to be justified from sin. So Romans 4. 6, 7, 8. where
the Apostle shows, that whose iniquities are forgiven, who^e sins are
covered, to whom the Lord imputes not sin, to them he imputes
righteousness without works, (where the Apostle, says De justice. l. 2. c.
9.. Potest.
Bellarmine, ex non imputatione peccatorum colligit imputationem justitiae from
the not imputing of sin he gathers the imputation of righteousness,) them
he justifies, them he makes blessed. So Luke 18. 13, 14. when our Savior
would signify, that the Lord had hea^d the prayer of the Publican who had
prayed for the remission of his sin he says, he went home justified. But
the sins of the faithful are remitted by imputation of Christ's satisfaction
to them. This the Papists themselves cannot deny. Or if they did, the whole
Doctrine of the Gospel would confute them: which teaches that Christ dyed for
our sins, that he has redeemed us from all our iniquities, that he gave
himself (...) a full price of ransom for us, 1 Timothy 2. 6. that he gave
himself for us an offering and sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savor,
Ephesians. 5. 2. that in him God is well pleased and reconciled unto us forgiving
our sins, 2 Cor. 5. 19. that he is the propitiation for our sins, 1 John
2. 2. that he bare our iniquities, Esai 53. 12. that in his own^ body he bare
our sins upon the Tree, 1 Pet. 2. 24. that by him we have redemption, Ephesians.
1. 7.
that is, remission of sins, that we are justified by his blood, Romans 5. 9.
and by his obedience, verse 19. that God is just Romans 3. 25, 26.
in justifying a believing sinner and therefore forgiveth no sin for which
his justice is not satisfied. And his justice cannot be satisfied for our
sins, being an infinite offense, as Bellarmine himself confesses, but by a
price or satisfaction of infinite value, which can be no other but the perfect
and all-sufficient satisfaction of Christ, which the Lord accepts in behalf
of all those that believe in him, which is nothing else but to impute it to
them: for if God should not accept of Christ's satisfaction in the behalf of
those that believe, then in vain had Christ dyed or satisfied for us.
Therefore the faithful are justified by imputation.

. IX. Hereunto the Papists have nothing to oppose but their own erroneous
assertion, (which is hereby confuted) that remission of sin is an utter
abolition, extinction, deletion of sin by infusion of righteousness.

But as in the Law two things are to be considered, the precept it self, and
the sanction thereof denouncing punishment to the transgressout: so in sin
there are two things to be considered, the (...) it self which is the
transgression of the precept, and the guilt which binds over the sinner to
punishment. The (...) is twofold: for it is partly transient, which is the
sinful act or transgression it self; and partly immanent in the soul of the
offender, which is that macula or labes, the blemish, spot or pollution, which
the act does leave behind it: in respect whereof, as Bellarmine teaches, the
transgressour after the act is gone remains formally a sinner. The guilt also
is twofold; for it is either reatus culpae the guilt of offense or of offending
God; and reatus paenae, which is the binding over of the sinner unto
punishment. Now, God does take away the sins of the faithful both in respect
of the fault and also of the guilt of punishment but not after one manner. He
takes away the guilt by remission of sin: for in regard of the guilt our
sins are debts, which debts God does forgive when he remitteth the
punishment, and takes away the guilt, which did bind us over to punishment, by
imputation of Christ's sufferings unto us: who as our surety did pay our debts
for us. And because our Savior fully satisfied our debt, therefore our sins,
in respect of the guilt of death, are in our justification wholly taken away,
and in that respect there is an utter deletion of them, as there uses to be of
debts, ^out of debt books when they are satisfied. But when the Lord does
justify a man, he does impute unto him not only the suffering of Christ to
free him a paena and reatu paenae, but also his obedience, that he may be
constituted righteous and so freed also a culp^ and reatu (...). For as
touching the fault whether you mean the sinful act which is transient, or the
sinful blemish remaining in the soul, which is a vicious disposition and
pronenesse to sin, left as the remainder of original sin, and increased by
our own actual transgressions, as it is a fault and the offense of God
bringging with it reatum culpae, to a believer and is not imputed to whom
Christ's obedience is imputed, but covered with the robe of Chris^s
righteousness, by imputation whereof he is not only freed from the guilt both
of the punishment and of the fault, but also accepted as righteous in Christ:
but as the macul^ is an habitual sin, or sinful disposition polluting the
soul as a remainder of original sin increased by our actual
transgressions, it is not wholly abolished in this life, and much less at
once, but it is mortified by degrees in those that repent of their sins, who
day by day 2 Cor. 4. 16.
are renewed in the innerman. As for those places, which Bellarmine alleges
to prove remission of sin to be the total abolition of sin. I have fully
answered heretofore Lib. 2. c. 7.
in the second question of the first controversy, showing that diverse of them
are to be understood in respect of the guilt, which in remission is totally
abolished. The other which are to be expounded of the corruption, are
understood of the cleansing and purging of our souls from them, either begun
in this life, or finished at the end of this life. For the death of the body
brings with it in the children of God, the death and utter extinction of
sin. And therefore death which was brought in as a punishment of sin
becomes a remedy to extinguish sin. For whiles we live in the mortal body,
sin lives in us: but when the body dies, sin is extinguished.

CAP. III. Containing our two last Arguments.
. I.

OUR foureteenth Argument. If redemption, reconciliation, 14. Because
redemption, reconciliation, adoption, or imputive.
and adoption be imputative, then justification also is by imputation. For I
have showed heretofore, that these three in substance differ not from
justification, for as all these three benefits are comprised under
justification, so in them the whole nature of justification does consist. For
what is it to be redeemed and reconciled, but to have our sins Ephesians. ^. 7.
remitted or not 2 Cor. 5. 19.
imputed by the imputation of Christ's sufferings (which is the first part of
justification) and what is it to be adopted but to be accepted in the beloved
as righteous and as an heir of eternal life by imputation of Christ's
obedience? which is the second part of justification. But those three benefits
are imputative, all of them wrought by the not imputing of sin, which had
made us the bondslaves of sin and Satan, enemies to God, and children of the
devil; and by the imputation of Christ's merits, whereby of the slaves of sin
and Satan, we are made Gods 1 Cor. 6. 19, 20.
servants; of enemies, his favorites; of the children of the devil, the
sons of God.

. II. Our fifteenth Argument, out of Psalm. 32. and Romans 4. If Argument 15.
Psalm. 32. 1, 2. Romans 4. 6, 7. 8.
the Holy Ghost describe justification to be the forgiving of iniquities, the
covering of sin, the not imputing of sin to the sinner, the imputing of
righteousness not to him that works, but to him that believes in Christ, or
imputing of righteousness without works: then justification stands not in
deletion of sin by infusion of righteousness, but in imputation of Christ's
righteousness, by which the sinner is both freed from his sin, and also
accepted as righteous.

But the Holy Ghost does so describe justification, Romans 4. 6, 7, 8. ^x Psalm.
32. 1, 2.

To both parts De iustif. l. 2. 6. 9.. Terti^.
Bellarmine does answer. The assumption he first denies, and then cavills
with it. For first whereas Calvin, as he says, demands, whether this be a
full definition of justification, or but half? he likewise demands, when
either the (...) says, Blessed is the Psalm. 112. 1. f 1^ 9. 1.
man that fears the Lord, and Blessed are they who f are upright in the way:
or when our Savior says, Blessed are the poor in Spirit, Matthew. 5. 3. 5.
blessed are the meek, etc. whether each of these be a perfect definition.
For if it be, where is then remission of sin? Secondly, he says, that Paul
alleges this testim^ny out of the Psalm, not that he might thereby define
fully justification, but only to prove, that true justification is the gift of
God, and not gotten by our own strength. And that he fitly proves from
thence, that David calls him blessed whose sins God remitteth, that is, wh^
by the gift and grace of God is justified.

. III. To the former I reply: that there is not the like reason, between
B^llarmines answers refuted* The first.
these places cited by us, and those alleged by him. For those contain but
certain notes and marks of Blessedness (though the Papists absurdly make
eight beatitudes of the eight notes of one and the same blessedness, Matthew.
5.) But here the Apostle out of Psalm. 32. shows that blessedness it self
(whereby as appears by the former verse, he means justification, which is
the only (...) viae, because by it we are entitled to the eternal happiness,
which is beatitudo patriae, all other Pronounciations of blessedness.
(...), being but notes and signs of this) is so defined or described. For
so much those words import, David does describe the blessedness, as our
translation fitly renders the word, (...), in this place.

The second is a mere depravation of the Apostles meaning, and inten^ion;
which was, not to prove that justification is the gift of God, which he had
already taught to be a gracious action of God freely justifying by his grace,
those that believe in Christ: but by a new supply of Arguments to prove the
same question, which in the former Chapters he had disputed: concluding that a
man is justified by faith and not by works, which question here he proves by
the example of Abraham, and by the testimony of David. The Argument drawn from
Abrah^ms example, is an excellent proof, which Chrysostom well observed, as
Cardinal In Romans 4. annot. 1.
T^let does acknowledge. For Abraham had both faith and works, and yet he was
justified not by his works but by his faith. If Abraham had had no works, or
not such notable works, it might have been said; that he was justified by
faith without works, because he wanted works. But seeing he abounded with
store of excellent works, and yet was not justified by them, but only by
faith: this is an invincible argument to prove that a man is justified by
faith, and not by works. For Abraham though he had works, yet was justified
by faith without works. Likewise David describes (or if you will) declares
the blessedness of the man, that is, that a man is blessed, that is to say,
justified, to whom the Lord imputes righteousness without works.

. IV. This was his denial of the assumption. But now he cavilleth,
Bellarmines* cavil with the assumption.
that it may be, that in these words is contained the full definition of
justification implicit. For there cannot be remission of sin, (in
Bellarmines sense, that is deletion of sin) unless righteousness be
inf^sed: as darkness is not driven away, unless light come in place. And
this, says he, The Apostle manifestly shows, when he says, David explaineth
the blessedness of a man to whom the Lord imputes righteousness without
works, Bl^ssed are they whose sins are forgiven. Vbi (says Bellarmine) ex
non imputatione peccatorum colligit imputationem justitiae where the Apostle
from the not imputing of sin gathers the imputing of justice: which is very
true, and proves that here is a full definition of justification containing
these two parts, the not imputing of sin to the believer, and imputing of
righteousness, or accepting of him as righteous. But where is either the
popish deletion of sin, or infusion of righteousness? unless as they have
turned remission into deletion, so also imputation be converted into infusion.

. V. To the proposition also Bellarmine answers in part: and Bellarmines
answer to the proposition, and first to the word covering.
first to the word covering, that although to cover and not to impute sins,
is not; if you respect the force of the word, to abolish or to extinguish
sin, yet if they be referred to God, the sense imports so much. For nothing
can be bid from God, unless it be ^tterly taken away: for all things are
naked and open before his eyes. Reply, Nothing can be hid from God, which he
would not have hid. But if it please God to cover our sins, that he will not
behold them, Psalm. 85. 2. or to hide his face from them, Psalm. 51. 9. to cast
them behind his back, Esai. 38. 17. not to mark what is done amiss, Psalm.
130. 3. then he is said not to see them, because he takes no notice of them,
but passes by them, Mic. 7. 18. In which sense Charity is said to cover
sins, Prove. 10. 12.

. VI. To the word not imputing, he says, that God cannot but impute To the
word not imputing.
sin to him that rema^neth a sinner: neither can he repute him righteous,
unless he be made righteous: therefore ^he not imputing of sin draws with
it, veram peccati remissionem, that is the extinction of sin, and infusion of
righteousness. Reply, he should have said, as he said before; the not imputing
of sin draws with it imputing of righteousness, or the acceptance of a
man as righteous: both which always go together, because both are wrought
together by imputation of Christ's righteousness: whereas therefore he says,
that God cannot but impute sin, where sin still remains: it is true of
unbeleevers and impenitent sinners, who are out of Christ; but for them that
be in Christ, that is to say, believing and repentant sinners, for whose
sins Christ has fully satisfied, and whom though in themselves sinners, he
has accepted as righteous in Christ? and for whom our Savior makes
intercession, that their sins may not be imputed to them: he cannot truly be
said to impute sin unto them. It is true also that the Lord reputeth none
righteous, but such as he makes righteous, both by imputation of Christ's
righteousness, and also by regeneration: by imputation perfectly, and at once;
by regeneration in part and by degr^s, they being not only Spirit but flesh
also: in regard whereof though they be righteous in Christ; yet in themselves
they are sinners, by reason of sin remaining in them, though in some measure
mortified, and not at all imputed. So that a regenerate man in diverse respects
is both a righteous man and a sinner: righteous, not only in Christ by
imputation of his perfect righteousness, but also in himself by inherent
righteousness begun in him, from which, as is from the better part, (...) has
his denomination in the Scriptures: a sinner also in himself, both in respect
of habitual sins remaining in him as the remnants of original sin, and
also in respect of actual transgressions, both of commission and of omission,
whereinto he does daily fall.

. VII. And whereas he says, that these phrases almost always Whether not
imputing do not signify deletion.
go together, and to that purpose cites, Nehem. 4. 5. Psalm. 51. 9, 85. 2 and
so Psalm. 32. 1, 2. I answer that deletion of sin, covering of sin,
forgiving of sin and the not imputing of it, are used as synonima, that is,
as words of the same signification: and that in all such places deletion of sin
does signify the blotting of them our of Gods remembrance which is, as it were
his record or debt book. Out of which, when God forgiveth sins, he blotteth
or wipeth them out. Thus, to forgive sins is not to remember them, Esai 43. 25.
I, even I am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine own sake, and
will not remember thy sins, Ier. 31. 34. I will forgive their iniquity, and I
will remember their sin no more. And to remember them is not to forgive them.
Ps. 109. 14. Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the Lord, and
let not the sin of his Mother be blotted out, namely of remembrance, that
is, let it not be forgotten: So Neh. 4. 5. Cover not their iniquity, and let
not their sin be blotted out before thee. Ps 51. 9. hide thy face from my sins,
and blot out all mine iniquities: and to the same purpose, Psalm. 85. 2.
forgiving and covering are used in the same fence. Thou have forgiven the
iniquity of thy people, thou have covered all their sin, and so Psalm. 32. 1.
2. forgiving, covering, not imputing. Deletion therefore of sins according to
the Scriptures is the blotting of them out of the Book of Gods remembrance. In
this sense many things are said deleri to be blotted out, or wiped away by
oblivion, whose memory is wiped out, as it is said of the Amalekites, Exodus 17.
14. and according to the vulgar Latin translation, Deuteronomy. 31. 21. nulla delebit
oblivio, Esth. 9. 28. Eccl. 6. 4. Ierem. 20. 11. 23. 40. 50. 5. So that non
imputare is all one with ignoscere, 2 Timothy 4. 16. So Job 42. 8. according to
the vulgar Latin. 2 Cbro. 30. 19. Ezekiel. 33. 16.

. VIII. Now, if not to impute sin be, as Bellarmine s^ith, to Chemnitius his
argument from the rule of contraries.
expel sin by infusion of righteousness (for, according to his concelt
infusion of righteousness is not a consequent of the expulsion of sin, as
here for a poor evasion he says, but expulsion of sin is a consequent of
infusion of righteousness: for, according to his assertion, by infusion of
righteousness sin is expelled as by accession of light and heat, cold and
darkness is expelled) I say, if not to impute sin be to expel sin, by
infusion of justice; then by the rule of contraries, which is, Contrariorum
contraria sunt consequentia, to impute sin shall be to expel righteousness
by infusion of sin, as it was well objected by Chemnitius. To him Bellarmine
objecteth want of Logic, for calling those contraria, which are
contradicentia. Where by Bellarmines Logic adversa only are contraria,
whereof notwithstanding there are four sorts: for if contraries be such
opposits as are opposed one to one only, then besides adversa as Tully terms
those which Aristotle calls (...), there are three other sorts of contraries,
that is to say relata, which Aristotle calls (...), privantia (...) which are
opposed (...) as privation and habit, contradicentia (...) or (...) which are
opposed (...) as affirmation and negation, which Tully calls velde contraria.
Thus if Bellarmines Logic be good, there are no opposits but contraries, nor
any contraries but adversa, when it is acknowledged by better Logicians than
himself, that of all opposites the most contrary are those which are opposed
as affirmation and negation which are called contradicentia, as imputare non
imputare, which are so immediately opposed, as the one of them is always true,
quidlibet affirmare and negare verum, but cannot both be true together, for
that implies a contradiction. And therefore Chemnitius objection stands
still in force.

. IX. Again if the holy Ghost in this place had meant by remission Imputing
and covering are of things which be.
of sin, the deletion or abolition of it, he would not have called it,
remitting, covering, or hiding, or not imputing of it. For nothing is either
remitted, covered or not imputed, but that, which is. And things are hid, not
that they should not be, but that they should not be seen. Tecta ergo
peccata quare dixit? says Augustine, ut non viderentur. As a prudent man
hides his knowledge, Prove. 12. 23. and an hypocrite his sin, we know this,
says Bellarmine, but withal we know, that somethings are covered that they
may be preserved; and some things, that they may be abolished. As wounds are
covered with a plaster: the most ordinary end, and perpetual consequent of
hiding any thing he leaves out; which is, that it may not be seen, and so
God hides our sins, when he hides his face from them.

. X. But for our learning, Bellarmine will show us the expositions The
expositions of Fathers objected by Bellarmine.
of the Fathers, that we may know how far we swarve from the meaning of the
ancient and Orthodox Church. And first, he cites Justin Dialog. cum Tryphone
Iudaeo. sub finem.
Martyr, who alleging, Psalm. 32. 2. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord does
not impute sin, that is says he, that a man (...) repenting of his sins
receives from God, (...) the forgiveness of his sin, (where he expounderh
the not imputing of sins, to be the forgiveness thereof.) But says he, not
as you deceive your selves and others, like you in this point, who say, that
although they be (...) (that is, not those which have sin, but such as the
Scripture calls sinners, that is to say, impenitent sinners) so that they
know God, the Lord will not impute sin unto them, though they do not repent,
wherein we wholly agree with Justin, though the Papists do not: who deceive
themselves and others; whom they persuade though they live in sin, if they
observe the outward formality of doing penance, which all of them do once a
year, though they neither have faith nor repentance, (which very few, if any
of them have,) they have absolution from their sin.

. XI. In the next place he cites Origin Origin in Romans lib. 4.
and Hierome, both which do make three degrees of the three phrases; wherein,
as they conceive David ascends from the less to the greater: when as
notwithstanding it is apparent, that if those phrases did signify diverse
things, the first were the greatest, and the middle the least, according to the
variety of the words whereby sin in this place is signified. Origin sets
them Pishal chataah. havon.
down not as the gifts of God, as Bellarmine bears us in hand, but as a man's
own merits: for because, says he, the beginning of the conversion of the
soul is to forsake evil, from this he deserves (which the Papists
themselves deny) to receive remission of sin. But when he shall begin to
do good, as it were, covering over his former evils with new good things -- he
is said to cover sins. But when he shall come to a perfect man, insomuch that
from the soul the very root of all wickedness is cut off, in so much, that
no footstep of wickedness can be found therein (which never happens in this
life, for concupiscence which remains in all, is both a footstep of sin at
the least, and the very root of all iniquity, Iam. 1. 14.) where now the sum
of perfect blessedness is promised, then God cannot impute any sin, which
was a private and unsound conceit, as there are many more of Origin: from which
though we dissent, we cannot justly be said to swarve from the doctrine of
the Primitive Orthodox Church.

. XII. Hierome, Hieromein Psalm. 31.
(if yet it be Hierome) mentions three degrees but all of remission of sin,
for so he says: quibus modis remittuntur peccata? tribus: by what ways are
sins remitted? by three. They are remitted by Baptism, they are covered by
Charity, they are not imputed by Martyrdom: which assertion also is unsound:
both because according to this conceit, to no man is sin not imputed, but
only to Martyrs: and also because by Charity he seems to understand, not
Gods love, but ours, when notwithstanding it is evident, though our charity
cover other men's sins, Prove. 12. 10. yet our sins are to be covered by the
love and mercy of God in Christ. Howbeit in that which follows, he is
moresound, and agrees with us, quod tegitur, non videtur: quod non videtur,
non imputatur: quod non imputatur, nec punietur what is covered, is not seen:
what is not seen, is not imputed: what is not imputed shall not be punished:
where he plainly shows that the covering and not imputing of sin, is the
not punishing of it. But this distinction of the words into three degrees is
rejected by Saint in Romans ^.
Ambrose, who says, that to remit, cover, and not impute, are all of one sense
and meaning. Indeed he says, that diverse names of sins are here mentioned,
whereby we may gather the variety of sins, but the Verbes be of one
signification, quia and cum tegit, remittit: and cum remittit, non imputat.
because when he covers, he remitteth; and when he remitteth, he does not
impute. And this exposition is most agreeable ^to that of Saint Paul, who by
all these three understands one and the same thing, which is the imputation
of righteousness without works. For it is the manner of the men of God in
their Psalms and Hymns recorded in the Word of God; for their greater
comfort, as it were by way of exultation, to dwell upon those things wherein
they rejoice, by expressing the same in diverse and sundry ^ermes, whereby the
selse same thing is repeated; which Rhetoricians call (...). Augusti^ testimony
con^. sen (...). 2. in Psa. 31.


. XIII. In the last place he cites two testimonies against us which he
calls out of Augustines exposition of these words, which being entirely cited
agrees wholly with us. For, to omit his exposition of these words a little
before set down, quorum tecta sunt peccata, whose sins are covered, that is,
says he, quorum peccata in oblivione^ ducta sunt, whose sins are brought into
oblivion: in the place quoted by Bellarmine, he has these words. Blessed --
are they whose sins are covered: he does not say in whom no sins are found, but
whose sins are covered. The sins are covered and hid, they are abolished or
blotted out (by oblivion, according to his own former exposition even now
alleged.) If God covered sins, he would not have an eye to them nor animadvert
them, if he would not animadvert them, neither would he punish them Noluit
agnoscere, maluit ignoscere; he would not take notice of them, he would rather
pardon them. Blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are
covered: then follow the words cited by Bellarmine. Ne sic intelligatis, do
not sounderstand, what he says, whose sins are covered, as though they were
there, and lived, unmortified and unrepented of. For that they be there still,
though mortified, appears both by the words before, that they may be found
there, though covered; and by his next words, tecta ergo peccata quare dixit?
ut non viderentur: why then did he say that sins are covered? not, that they be
not at all, but, that they may not be seen. Quid enim erat Dei videre peccata,
nisi punire peccata? for what is Gods seeing of sin, but his punishing of sin?
and so on the other side, what is his not seeing or covering of sin, but his
not punishing or pardoning it? Afterward, making way for the exposition of
verse 3. he says, that no man is without sin, and that no man can boast that
he is clean from sins. And that therefore men, if they would have their sins
cured, they must not hide them, like the Luke 18.
Pharisee, who be ing in the Temple, as it were, in statione medici, did show
his sound parts, and hid his wounds. Deus ergo tegat vulnera, noli tu: let God
therefore cover thy wounds, do not thou. For if thou being ashamed wilt cover
thy wounds, the Physician will not cure it: then follow the words cited by
Bellarmine in the second place, Medicus tegat and curet; emplastro enim tegit.
Let the Physician cover and cure: for with a plaster he covers: then
follows: under the cover of the Physician the wound is healed: under the
cover of him that is wounded, the wound is concealed. From whom do thou
conceal it? from him that knows all things. Therefore brethren see what he
says verse. 3.
quum tacut, etc. because I held my peace my bones are waxen old, etc. where
August. does not expound these words, whose sins are covered, but shows that
if we would have them healed we should not cover them, but confess them to
our Spiritual Physician, that he covering them with an emplaister, may cure
them: all which we confess: so that he needed not to quote the two Gregory's
to prove, that God does, as it were, with a plaster cover and cure our sins.
But withal we would know of Bellarmine, what this plaster is. Is it our
inherent righteousness, as the Papists teach? or is it not the righteousness
and satisfaction of Christ, by whose stripes Esai. 53. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 24.
we are healed? for as I shall show presently out of Ad Diognetum.
Justin Martyr, whom here to no purpose Bellarmine did allege in the first
place, nothing could cover our sins, but only the righteousness of Christ,
by whom the iniquity of many is hid or covered.

. XIV. Diverse other arguments Bellarmine mentions, as cited out of Calvin's
Institutions, Lib. 3. c. 11. in answering whereof, besides some of those which I
have produced, he spends six De iustif l. 2.
whole Chapters, which c. 9. 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
notwithstanding, for the most part, are not there to be found: but seem at
least some of them to have been devised of his own brain, and by him framed
and fitted to his own strength: that, having overcome these counterfeit
enemies, he might seem to have refuted us. But these arguments, which I have
produced, are sufficient for the proof of the point in question; and them I
have defended against his cavils. If any man desire to see the defense of the
rest, that is, to see Bellarmines objections, devised for us, maintained
against himself, he may have recourse to the answer of David Paraeus, who
has in so many Chapters answered Bellarmines exceptions, Lib. 2. de justif.
Cap. 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.

Now I proceed to the testimonies of the Fathers, and of other later Writers.

CAP. IV. Testimonies of Writers both Old and New, proving justification by
righteousness imputed.
. I.

I Begin, as Bellarmine did, with Ad diagnetum. (...)
Justin Martyr. For what other thing, says he, could hide or cover our sins,
but the righteousness of the Son of God? In whom was it possible, that we
sinners and ungodly should be justified, but in the only Son of God? O
sweet commutation -- that the iniquity of many should be hid in one just
person, and that the righteousness of one should justify many sinners!

2. Athanas. tom. 2. adv. eos qui negant Christum ex natura nostra sumpsse
primitias. (...).
Athanasius, affirms that the fulfilling of the Law wrought by the first
fruits (whereby he means the flesh of Christ) is imputed to the whole lump.

3. In Cantic. hom. 2. (...)
Gregory Nyssene, marvel not (says the Spouse) that uprightness has loved
me: but that being black by reason of my sin, and by my works drawing near
to darkness, he has made me beautiful by his love, making an exchange of
his beauty with my blackness. For having translated the filthiness of my
sins unto himself, he has made me partaker of his purity, communicating
unto me his own beauty.

4. Chrysostom. in Romans 10. 4. bomil. 17. and afterwardse (...).
Chrysostom, here the Apostle shows that there is but one righteousness,
and that that (of the Law) is recapitulated or reduced to this (of faith.) And
that he which has gotten this which is by faith, has also fulfilled that: but
he that despises this, he falls from that together with this: and a little
after ^ if thou beleevest in Christ, thou have fulfilled the Law and have
performed much more, than the Law commanded. For thou have received a far
greater righteousness. For as he had said in the words going before, that
Christ has justified us by faith (...), more amply, than we would have been
justified by the Law. This greater, this more ample righteousness must needs
be understood of Christ's righteousness imputed unto us.

5. In Psalm. 119. conc. 3. qui dicit iniquitates suas Deo iustificatur.
Ambrose, he that confesses his sins to God is justified, that is, obtains
remission of sin, which is also testified by S John 1 Ioh. 1. 9. and is
verified in David, Psalm. 32. 5. and in the Publican, Luke 18. 14. But he that
is justified by remission of sin, is also justified by imputation of
righteousness: for as Bellarmine confesses, the not imputing of sin
brings with it imputation of righteousness.

6. Adv. Pelag l. 1. Tunc. iusti sumus q^avdo nos peccatores fatemur, and
iustitia nostra non ex proprio merito, sedex. Dei consistis misericordia.
Hierome, to the like purpose, then are we just, when we confess our selves
to be sinners: and our righteousness consists not in our own merit, but in
Gods mercy.

7. In Joan. tr. 3.
Augustine, omnes qui per Christum justificati, j^sti non in se, sed in illo.
All that are justified by Christ, are just, not in themselves, but in him. And
thereunto add the testimonies before Huius libri c. 1.. 5.
cited out of Hierome, In 2 Cor. 5. 21.
Augustine, Enchirid. c. 41.
S^dulius, and In 2 Cor. 5. 21.
Anselmus, who all have taught, that we when we are justified, are made
righteous, not in our selves, but in Christ.

Again, De civit. D. l. 19 c. 27. ut potius remissione peccatorum constet,
quam perfectione virtutum.
Augustine teaches that our justice in this life does stand rather in the
remission of sins, than in perfection of virtues. That is, as I understand
him, that our chief righteousness in this life, is that of justification, and
not of sanctification: for that is perfect, and so is not this: by that we are
justified before God and entitled unto heaven, so are we not by this. Here De
iustif l. 2. cap. 13.
Bellarmine would seem to acknowledge that remission of sin concurreth to
justification: but his constant and perpetual doctrine is, that justification
consists wholly, in the infusion of righteousness expelling sin, in so
much that remission of sin and infusion of righteousness are not two actions
but one, etc. which assertion supposed, how could Augustine say, that our
righteoufnesse is such in this life that it consists rather in the
forgiveness of sin, than in the perfection of virtues, seeing virtue infused
is the force of justification, and expels sin, and is all in all, and if
that assertion of the utter deletion of sin, when it is remitted were true,
most vain were that boasting of De Jacob. and vita beat. l. 1. c. 6.
Ambrose, who says, gloriabor, non quia vacuus peccati sum, sed quia mihi
remissa sunt peccata. Homil de expos. symboli.
Maximus Taurinensis, when God does remit sin, indulgentia facit innocentem,
by his indulgence he makes the party innocent.

8. Among the latter Writers I will give the first place to Bernard, who says
death Ad milites temploserm. 11.
by the death of Christ is put to flight, and Christi nobis justitia imputatur,
and the righteousness of Christ is imputed to us.

2. What could Epist. 190.
man do of himself to recover his righteousn^sse once lost, being the servant
of sin and the bondsman of the devil? Assignata est ei proinde aliena
justitia, qui caruit sua: therefore another man's righteousness was assigned
unto him, who wanted his own. 3. Ibid.
One dyed sor all, ut viz. satisfactiounius omnibus imputetur: that the
satisfaction of one might be imputed to all. 3. If he shall say Ibid.
thy father ( Adam) made thee guilty: I will answer that my brother has
redeemed me^: Why not righteousness from another, seeing guilt is from
another? 5. He will Ibid.
not condemn the just, who had mercy on a sinner. I may call my self just,
sed illius justitia, but by his righteousness, and what is that? Christ the
end of the Law unto righteousness to every one that believes, Finally, who of
God the Father was made righteousness unto us. Is not that therefore my
righteousness which was made righteousness unto me? 6. Lord In cant. sermon.
Domine by. memo^ abor iustitiae tuae solius, ipsa enim est and mea, etc.
I will mention thy righteousness only: for that is mine also: for thou of
God was made righteousness to me: should I fear, that it being but one,
should not suffice us both? It is not a short cloak, which is not able,
according to the Prophet, to cover two. Thy righteousness is an everlasting
righteousness: What is longer than Eternity? Thy eternal and large
righteousness it will cover largely both thee and me: And in me truly it
covers a mul^itude of sins: but in thee, Lord, what does it cover but the
treasures of piety: and riches of bounty? which testimony does plainly prove
against Bellarmine, that Bernard by Christ's righteousness which he says is
made ours, does not mean that righteousn^sse which is inhe^ent in us, but that
which is out of us in Christ, And the same is evidently proved by those
testimonies before Supr. l. 1. 5.
alleged, that we are made the righteousness of God in Christ, not ours but
his, not in our selves but in him: even as Christ was made sin, not his, but
ours; not in himself, but in us.
9. Cardinal Contarenus De iustif p. 591.
, in a treatise of justification which he wrote Anno. 1541. testifies that God
with his Spirit gives Christ unto us, and does freely of his mercy make all
Christ's righteousness to be ours, and imputes it to us, who put on Christ.
That by faith we do attain to a double righteousness: the one, inherent in
us, by which we begin to be just, and are made partakers of the divine nature,
and have charity diffused in our hearts: the other, not inherent, but given
unto us with Christ. I mean (says he) the righteousness of Christ and all
his merits, both which are in time given together. Now says he, forasmuch as I
have said, that by faith we attain to a twofold righteousness, the one,
inherent in us, viz. charity, or that grace by which we are made partakers of
the divine nature: the other being the righteousness of Christ given and
imputed to us, because we are ingrafted into Christ; and have put on Christ,:
It remains we should inquire on whether of them we ought to rely, and to
think our selves justified before God, that is, to beheld or esteemed holy and
just: I mean by such a righteousness which may beseem Gods children, and
satisfy the eyes of God? Ego prorsus existimo. Ego prorsus existimo pie and
Christian dici, quod debemus niti, niti, inquam, tanquam restabili, quae certo
nos sustentat, iustitia Christi nobis donata, non autem sanctitate and gratia
nobis inherente.
I do utterly think, that it may be godlily and Christianly said, that we
ought to rely, I say, to rely, as upon a sure thing, which does assuredly
sustain us, on the righteousness of Christ given unto us, and not on that
holiness and grace which is inherent in us. For this our righteousness is but
begun and unperfect, which cannot safeguard us, but that in many things we
offend, and daily do offend; and have need to pray daily, that our debts may
be forgiven us: wherefore in the sight of God Idcirco in conspectu Dei non
possumus ob banc iustitiam nostram haberi iusti. etc.
we cannot for this justice be accounted just and good, as it would become the
sons of God to be good and holy. But the righteousness of Christ which is
given unto us, is tru^ and perfect justice, which is altogether pleasing in the
eyes of God, in which there is nothing which may offend God, or which does not
highly please him: upon this therefore being certain and sure we are to rely,
and for it alone to believe, that we are justified, that is, to be held and
pronounced just. This is that precious treasure of Christians, who so finds,
sells all he has, that he may buy it. This is that precious pearl, which
who finds, leaves all, that he may have it. The Apostle Paul says, I
esteemed all other things loss, that I might gain Christ, not having mine
own righteousness, but that which is by the faith of Christ And a little
after he says, that the more holy any men are, so much the more they
understand themselves to stand in need of Christ and his righteousness
vouchsafed to them: and therefore forsaking themselves rest upon Christ alone,
etc.

nisi ipse sua impartiretur justitia, qui nostra plane destituimur, quae
nostram iniquitatem and injustitiam tegeret -- David does not say the man is
blessed who has not committed sin, nor done iniquity: but blessed are they
whose iniquities are mercifully forgiven of God, whose sins he does cover and
hide with his justice. Blessed is the man to whom the Lord imputes not sin,
which he can scarcely be without, or at least never is without, and again; In
illo, etc. in Christ therefore we are justified before God, not in ourselves,
not with our righteousness but with his, which now is imputed to us having
communion with him: wanting righteousness in our selves we are taught extra
nos in illo justitiam quaerere, to seek for righteousness out of ourselves in
him. -- Now says he Fol. 47. 6.
that our righteousness stands in Christ's obedience, hence it is, because
we being incorporated into him, it is accepted of God in our behalf as if it
were ours, insomuch that by it self we are held just. And even as Jacob when
not being the first borne, but hiding himself under the habit of his brother,
and clothed with his garment, which sent forth a fragrant smell, obtained the
blessing from his Father: so we, that we may obtain the blessing of
righteousness from our heavenly Father, it behooves us to lie hid under the
precious purity of our eldest Brother, to smell sweet with his odor, and to
have our sins covered with his perfection. And finally he says, that if we
speak formally, and properly we are justified neither by faith nor charity,
but by the only righteousness of God in Christ by the only righteousness of
Christ communicated to us, and by the only mercy of God forgiving our sins,
which, says he, I have before made evident.

11. Conradus Clingius Loc. com. l. 2.
makes justification to be either imputative, which we call justification: or
active, which we call sanctification: the righteousness of the former, being
wholly in Christ: of the latter, in us: so that he differs but in terms from
us.

12. The Au^hors of the Book called Antididagm Cap. de iustif.
. Coloniens. say, that the righteousness of Christ imputed to us, is the
principal and ch^efe cause of our justification, upon which chiefly we ought
to rely and trust.

13. To these we may add the confession of our adversaries, who cannot deny,
but that Christ his satisfaction is imputed to all that are justified, or shall
be saved, as I have showed before. Ye^ this is the confession of all
Christians, who profess Christ to be our Savior, that the Lord accepts the
merits of Christ, that is, his obedience and sufferings in their behalf, as if
they had performed the same in their own persons. And what is this but to
impute the obedience of Christ and his sufferings unto us? Does not God accept
Christ's righteousness for us, or did he not thereby satisfy for us? To what
end then, as Bellarmine De iustif. l. 2. c. 5.
well infers, did Christ take upon him our nature? to what end and purpose
did he humble himself to do and to suffer so great things for us? For this
confession I argue thus. What righteousness and obedience of another the Lord
accepts for us, that he imputes to us for righteousness, for by imputation
we mean nothing else.

But the righteousness and obedience of Christ the Lord accepts for us,
otherwise he could not have been our Savior. Therefore the righteousness and
obedience of Christ is imputed to us for righteousness. CHAP. V. The
objections of the Papists against imputation.
. I.

FIrst they cavil at the word, and that in diverse respects, The Papists cavil
at the word first, because it is new.
for first they say it is new. Secondly they deride it calliug it justitiam
putatitiam an imaginary justice. Thirdly, they say, this assertion, that we
are justified by imputation of Christ's righteousness, is no where to be
found. To the first concerning novelty, I answer, that the word is used ten
times: Romans 4. and in the same sense, that we do use it, for accepting a man
as righteous, who in himself is a sinner, verse 5. or imputing to a man
righteousness, that works not verse. 5. or without works, verse. 6. that is,
without respect of any righteousness inherent in him or performed by him;
besides other places of the Scriptures, both in the Old Testament, and in the
New: where the Hebrew Chashab is read with Lamed, or the Greek (...), with a
dative of the person, whether in the Greek translation of the Old Testament or
in the Greek Text of the New. Examples of the Old Testament both in the Hebrew
text and in the Greek translation may be these, Genesis 15. 6. Levit. 7. 18. 17.
4. N^m. 18. 27. 30. 2 Samuel 19. 19. Hebr. Psalm. 32. 2. 105. 31. Prove. 17. 28.
Graec. Examples of the New Testament, besides those in the Epistle to the
Romans, 2 Cor. 5. 19. Gal. 3, 6. 2 Timothy 4. 16. Iam. 2. 23. In the Latin
vulgar translation, not only the Verb imputare and imputari are used in the
same sense, as 2 Chronicles. 30. 19. Job 42. 8. Psalm. 32. 2. Sap. 12. 1^. E^ek. 33.
16. Romans 4. 4. 8. 5. 13. 2 Timothy 4. 16. Philem. 18. but also reputure and
r^putari construed with a dative, as Genesis 15. 6. Numb. 18. 27. 30. Deuteronomy. 21. 8.
^bsque dativo. Deuteronomy. 23. 21. 24. 15. Iud. 4. 9. 2 Samuel 19. 19. 1 Chronicles. 21. 3.
Psalm. 106. 31. 1 Mac. 2. 52. Romans 4. 3. 5. 9. 10. 11. 22. 24. Galath. 3. 6.
Iam. 2. 23. But, say they, the Greek (...), which is a simple Verb, and the
Hebrew chashab does signify p^rare, not imputar^, to think, esteem or
account, not to impute. I answer, when the Hebrew Verb is read with Lamed, or
the Greek with the dative of the person, it signifies properly to impute, (as
in the places even now quoted) and is all one with (...) (which word also is
used by the Apostle, Romans 5. 13. Phile. 18. or (...) as In voce (...)
Vari^us does expound it producing this example, (...), The sins of the
children of God (...) to the Fathers, that is, imputes, or lays them to
their charge, and so the vulgar Latin translateth the Greek (...) by the
Latin imputare, as Romans 4, 4. 8. or reputare with a dative, as Romans 4. 3. 5,
etc. or accepta far, as Rom, 4. 6. which are all one, even in the opinion of
that Latin interpeter.

Neither should this act of imputation seem strange seeing the practice
thereof is usual among men. For as when the debtour being not able to make
payment, if the surety shall pay the whole sum or satisfy for the debt, the
sureties payment or satisfaction is imputed to the debtour, and accepted in his
behalf, as if himself had discharged the debt. Even so we being debtours to
God, both in respect of the penalty due for our sins past, and also of
obedience which we owe for the time to come, and being altogether unable either
to satisfy the one or perform the other: Christ as our surety fatisfieth both
these debts for us, and his satisfaction is imputed unto us, and accepted in
our behalf, as if we in our own persons had discharged our debt. Secondly,
they cavil at imputative justice calling it putatitiam.


. II. Whereas in the second place they deride imputed justice, calling it
putatitiam, as if it were an imaginary righteousness only: which also, they say,
does both derogate from the glory of God, to whom it were more honorable to
make a man truly righteous, than to repute him righteous, who in himself is
wicked; and also detract from the honor of Christ's Spouse, who is only
arraied with her Husbands righteousness, as it were a Garment, being in
herself deformed. I answer first, whom^ the Lord does justify, he does
indeed and in truth constitute and make them righteous by imputing unto them
the righteousness of Christ, no less truly and really, than either Adams
sin was imputed to us, or our sins to Christ, for which he really
suffered. Secondly, whom God justifies or makes righteous by imputation, them
also he sanctifies, or makes righteous by infusion of a righteousness begun
in this life, and to be perfected when this mortal life is ended. And
further, that it is much more for the glory both of Gods justice and of his
mercy, when he justifies sinners, both to make them pe^fectly righteous by
imputation of Christ's righteousness: and also having freed them from hell by
the perfect s^tisfaction of his Son, and entitled them to the Kingdom of
Heaven by his perfect obedience; to prepare and to fit them for his own
Kingdom, by beginning a righteousness inherent in them, which by degrees
grows toward perfection in this life, and shall be fully perfected so soon
as this life is ended, rather than to justify, or to speak more properly to
sanctify them only by a righteousness which is unperfect and but begun,
which in justice can neither satisfy for their sins, nor merit eternal
life. And as for the Spouse of Christ, as it is most honorable for her to
stand righteous before God, not in her own unperfect righteousness, but in
the most perfect and absolute righteousness of Christ the eternal Son of God,
which far surpasses the righteousness of al men and Angels: so it is both
profitable to her, and honorable to God whiles she is to continue he^ warfare
and pilgrimage in this world, to be subject to insirmities and imperfections;
whereby she being humbled in her self, is taught to rely upon the power and
goodness of God whose 2 Cor. 12. 9.
grace is sufficient for her, and whose power is seen in her weakness;
especially considering, that though her obedience be unperfect, yet, it being
upright, it is not only accepted in Christ, by whose perfect obedience imputed
her wants are covered, but also graciously rewarded: and also considering, that
the remainders of sin are left ad agonem, that having maintained a spiritual
warfare against them, and the other enemies of her salvation, and having
overcome them, she may receive the Crown promised to them which overcome.

. III. As touching the third, which is Bellarmines first objection Thirdly,
that is no where to be found, B^llar. de iustif. l. 2. c. 7.
in this place, that it is no where read, that Christ's righteousness is
imputed unto us, or that we are justified by Christ's righteousness imputed. I
answer, that as in many other controversies the assertion of neither part is in
so many words and syllables expressed in the Scriptures: so neither in this.
For where do the Papists read, either in Scriptures, or Fathers, that our
righteousness inherent is the formal cause of our justification before God?
The contrary whereof, in substance, is so often read, as it is said, that we
are not justified by our works, or by our own righteousness, nor in our
selves, nor by a righteousness prescribed in the Law in which all inherent
righteousness is fully and perfectly described. But the substance of our
assertion is often read, as namely, First, that when God does justify a finner
he imputes righteousness unto him without works, that is, without respect
of any righteousness inherent in or performed by himself, Romans 4. 4, 5, 6.
Secondly, that he justifies him, not by the parties Romans 10. 3. Phil 3. 8, 9.
2 Cor. 5. 21.
own righteousness, or by making him righteous in himself, but by the
righteoufnesse of another, viz. Christ, in whom he is made righteous. Thirdly,
that we are justified by the blood Romans 5. 9. c 19.
and by the e obedience, that is the personal righteousness of Christ, which
neither it self, nor yet the merit thereof (without communication whereof no
man can be saved) is or can be communicated unto us otherwise than by
imputation. From whence we may argue thus.

The righteoufneffe whereby we are justified is imputed: for when God does
justify a man he imputes Romans 4. 6.
righteousness unto him.

By the righteousness of Christ we are justified, Romans 5. 9. 19.

Therefore the righteousness of Christ is imputed unto us. Fourthly, that as
by the disobedience of Adam we were made ^inners, namely, by the imputation
thereof unto us, (for neither the guilt, nor the corruption, nor the
punishment, which is death, had belonged to us, if the sin it self had not
been imputed unto us,) so by the obedience of Christ we are justified, which,
if it were not imputed to us, we could by it neither be freed from hell, nor
entitled to heaven, nor made inherently just by it. Fifthly, that we are so
made the righteousness of God in Christ, as he was made sin for us, that
is, by imputation. Sixthly, and lastly (to omit other proofs) when the Papists
do confess that Christ's satisfaction is imputed unto us: they confess as
much as we teach, if it be rightly understood. For his satisfaction for us is
either in respect of the penalty of the Law, to free us from hell; or in
respect of the Commandment, to entitle us to heaven. The penalty he has
satisfied by his sufferings, which is obedientia crucis his obedience of the
Cross: the Commandment, by the perfect fulfilling thereof, which is obedientia
Legis, his obedience of the Law. Now Bellarmine, as I have heretofore showed,
teaches in his fifth chapter of his second book that God accepts in our
behalf the righteousness of Christ, whereby he satisfied for us. And in the
tenth chapter, that not ou^ righteousness does satisfy for our sins, but
the righteousness of Christ which is imputed to us: and to that purpose cites
Epist. 190.
Bernard. For if one, faith he, dyed for all; then all were dead, that the
satisfaction of that one might be imputed to all, as he bare the sins of
all. His second and third a^gument both prove imputation to be needless.


. IV. Bellarmine his second and third argument both tend to prove that for the
justification of a sinner there is no need of imputation of Christ's
righteousness: where, in mine opinion, he might as well have alleged, that
there is no need of a Savior. For if there be need of a Savior, it is to
free us from the danger of damna ion, and to entitle us to the Kingdom of
heaven: both which benefits are employed in justification. But how should we,
who are sinners, and consequently by sin obnoxious to damnation, and excluded
from heaven, be either acquitted from hell, or made heirs of heaven? For
neither by our selves nor by any other means in the world can we be freed
from hell or have right to heaven, but only by the death and merits of Christ
our only Savior, which is so clear a truth, that the Papists themselves
cannot deny it. But how can we be freed from hell by Christ's sufferings, or
entitled to heaven by his obedience, if the Lord do not accept of his
sufferings and obedience in our ^ehalfe, as if we had suffered and done the
same in our own persons? If God do not accept them in the behalf of the
faithful, for whose sake he did obey and suffer: then all that Christ did and
suffered for us was in vain; and in vain did he take our nature and our
sins upon him If the Lord do accept in our behalf the fufferings and merits
of Christ, then does he impute them unto us. For by imputation, as I have said,
we mean nothing else. Neither can the sufferings and obedience of Christ,
being transient, as I have also showed before, be otherwise communicated unto
us, but by imputation.

. V. But come we to his second argument: for if, says he, imputation Arg. 2.
Imputation needl^sse, because remission is a total deletion of sin.
be necessary, it is chiefly for this cause, because a man after remission of
sin remains still a sinner, his sin being covered and not abolished. But
when sins are remitted, they are not only covered, but utterly abolished.
But here Bellarmine grossly mistaketh our assertion, as if we held, that sins
are first forgiven, and then, after the forgiveness of sins, righteousness
is imputed. But we hold, that by imputation of Christ's righteousness or
satisfaction we have remission of sin, and not otherwise: and therefore that
to remission it ^selfe imputation is absolutely necessary. For God forgiveth no
sin, nor remitteth the guilt of punishment for which his justice is not fully
satisfied. But we are not able our selves to satisfy for our sins but by
eternal punishment. Therefore it is impossible (salva Dei justitia) that our
sins should be forgiven, That the remission of sin is not the utter
deletion of sin: the first reason.
unless Christ's satisfaction be imputed unto us.

. VI. And whereas still he harpeth on that string that remission of sin is
the utter deletion or abolition of it, to wit, by infusion of righteousness,
and that therefore imputation of Christ's righteousness is needless; I
answer, first, that in sin two things are considered, the Of this see more,
l. 2 c. 7. and 8.
guilt, and the corruption. That in remission of sin the guilt is fully taken
away by imputation of Christ's perfect righteousness; but the corruption or
pollution is not taken away by remission, but by mortification; and that not
fully and at once, but by degrees. And howsoever these two benefits do always
concur, remission of sin and mortification of sin, (for whosoever are
freed from the guilt of sin are also freed from the dominion of sin; and to
whom the Lord grants remission, to them he grants repentance, Gods
forgiving and man's forgoing or forsaking of sin going always together)
notwithstanding they are by no means to be confounded. I confess that both of
them are wrought by the blood of Christ, and by his death; but in a diverse
respect. For by the blood of Christ is meant all that which issued out of his
blessed side, which was both blood and water, Ioh. 19. 34. which Saint John
verse. 35. notes as a thing most remarkable; and accordingly in his first
Epistle, Chapter 5. verse. 6. urges it. This is he that came by water and blood
(even Christ Jesus) not by water only, but by water and blood. The blood of
redemption, to redeem us from the guilt of sin; and the water of ablution,
to purge us from the pollution of sin. The death also of Christ may be
considered, either in respect of the merit thereof, as it is (...). a price or
ransom apprehended by faith, to redeem us from the guilt of sin: or in
respect of the virtue and efficacy, as it is a medicine or plaster Esaias 53. 5.
applied by the Holy Ghost to cure us of the malady of sin. Both Christ
works by his blood and by his death: but the former is done without us, and
(in respect of sins past, at once, as when a debt is fully satisfied) the
later is wrought in us, as when a disease is cured by degrees.

. VII. Secondly, if remission of sin be an utter deletion, or Reason ^.
a total abolition of sin, then no man's sin is forgiven in whom any sin
remains, which is a most desperate doctrine, as heretofore Lib. 2. c. 7.. 13.
I have showed: for where is that mortal man in whom no sin remains? If
the Papists say they have no sin, Saint 1 Ioh. 1. 8. 10.
John will tell them, that there is no truth in them. Thirdly, in the
Scriptures, to remit sin is not to abolish it but to pardon, Psalm. 32. 1. 2.
and to forgive it, or not to impute it. And further, God is said so to forgive
our sins, as we forgive the offenses of others: which we do, when by
charity Pro. 10. 1^.
we cover them; when we do not remember them with any desire or purpose to
revenge them: when we are reconciled to them that offended us. The difference
is, that God forgiveth not only in mercy, but in justice also; forgiving no
sins but those for which his justice is fully satisfied. He forgiveth
therefore those sins, for which Christ has satisfied, he remitteth the
punishment to us, which Christ has borne for us; he covers them, but with
the robe of Christ's righteousness: he is reconciled unto us, but it is
Christ, for whose sake he does forgive our sins. Thus therefore I argue, If
remission of sin be not the deletion of the sin it self by infusion of
righteousness, but the not imputing or covering of it, the taking away of the
guilt by imputation of Christ's satisfaction; then we are justified not by
infusion but by imputation: but the former is true; therefore the later.

Yea but ^aith Bellarmine the Scripture by remission of sin understands the
utter abolishing of sin, and to that purpose uses all manner of words, which
could be devised to express the utter deletion of sin: to which purpose he
alleges many testimonies, all which I have answered Lib. 2. c. 8*
heretofore.

. VIII. Fourthly, if there be a total deletion of sin in our justification by
the infusion of righteousness; then that righteousness which in our
justification is infused, is perfect: for the infusion of righteousness which
is unperfect, cannot cause a total abolition of sin. Nay, the imperfection
it self is a sin. But it is absurd to imagine, that the righteousness which
is infused in the first imaginary justification of the Papists; or, as we
speak, in our first regeneration is perfect, seeing in our best estate in this
life we receive but the first fruits of the Spirit: and in our first
regeneration, which is, as it were, our conception, we receive but the seeds,
as it were, of Gods graces. And therefore to imagine, that in Infants newly
Baptized, having not so much as the use of reason, there is perfection or full
growth of Faith, Hope, and Charity, when actually they neither can believe,
hope, or love, surpasses all absurdity. Especially when they acknowledge a
great difference, not only between viatores, which are in via, that is, the
faithful in this life; and comprehensores, which are in pa^ria, that is, the
Saints in heaven; but also among viatores themselves, whom they distinguish
into three degrees; incipientes, which are as infants; proficientes, which are
as adolescentes; and perfecti, which are as adulti, among whom none are so
perfect, P^il. 3. 14.
but that still something may and ought to be added; their inner man being
renewed from day to day: 2 Cor. 4. 16. until they come to full pe^fection,
which is not to be attained unto in this life. Shall then not only other
viatores be perfect, but incipientes also? Now it is apparent that their
justification is incipientium, even of infants in Baptism: in whom if there be
a total deletion of sin by infusion of righteousness; then that
righteousness which in Baptism is infused, is perfect, neither can any thing
be added to their Faith Hope, and Charity. But that there is no perfect
inherent righteousness in this li^e in any mere man whatsoever, may thus
briefly be proved. In whomsoever is sin in them is not perfect
righteousness: for perfect righteousness and sin cannot stand together. But
in all mortal men there is sin, therefore in no mere or mortal man is
perfect righteousness inherent.

CAP. VI. Bellarmines third argument, that because the righteousness infused
De iustif. lib. ^. c. 7.. tertio.
in justification is perfect, refuted.
. I.

BELLARMINE his third argument, whereby in the second Bellarmines third
argument: justice infused is perfect, therefore imputation of justice is
needless.
place he would prove the imputation of Christ's righteousness to be
needless unto justification, is because the righteousness which in
justification is infused, is perfect. But his argument is unsufficient, and his
disputation is ^ophisticall. Insufficient, for although our righteousness for
the time to come should be perfect: yet for the temission of sins past,
wherein in justification partly consists, the imputat^on of Christ's
satisfaction is absolutely necessary. His disputation is Sophistical; wherein
he argues a posse ad esse: and worse than so: for where he ought to prove,
that the righteousness infused in our justification is perfect in all that are
justified, and so soon as they are justified; he proves, that in some men
whom he accounts perfect, it may in some part of their life, after they have
been good proficients, be perfect. But that is not the question: but whether
the righteousness which in the justification of a sinner is infused, which
they call their first justification, be perfect, or not: for if it be unperfect
and but begun^ it cannot possibly justify a sinner before God; but for all it,
the imputation of Christ's righteousness will be most necessary. But let us
follow him in his proof, such as it is. Inherent righteousness, says he,
^onsisteth in these three especially, faith, hope and charity: if therefore
these may be perfect in this life, then o^r inherent righteousness may be
perfect. Here again he disputes sophistically: First, because, when he should
prove, that these habits of grace, when they are infused to justify men (as
namely in baptism) are perfect, and therefore that the imputation of Christ's
righteousness is needless: he proves, that they may be perfect in some
men, in some part of their life: secondly, whiles he proves severally the
perfection, or rather the possibility of the perfection of this or that virtue:
for perfection of inherent righteousness is not proved by the perfection of
any of these severally, but of them and of all others jointly. For if there be
imperfection in any of those virtues or graces wherein inherent righteousness
consists, then is not the inherent righteousness perfect. But let us see,
how he proves them severally. And first, for Faith: which he proves may be
perfect in this life: what it may be in some choice men, and in some part of
their life, it is not here questioned, but whether it be perfect, when men are
first justified thereby. The Apostles in some part of their life had a great
and a strong faith, yet for some time, even after they were justified, were, by
the censure of our Savior, but (...) Mat. 8. 16. 14 l 31. 16. 8. Luke 12. 28^
men of little faith.

. II. But yet let us see how he proves it may be perfect in this life. This he
endeavors to prove by six arguments, his first proof is this. Bellarmines
six proofs that faith is perfect. First, because it is perfect either here or
never.
If faith cannot be perfect in this life, then it can never be perfect, but it
is not to be believed, that so excellent a virtue shall never be perfect. The
consesequence of the proposition he proves; because in the life to come it
shall not be perfected, but evacuated, or made void. I answer, first, to the
prosyl. logisme, or proof of the proposition: for first, that, which he
calls the evacuating of faith, is the perfecting of it. It is eternal life
John 17. 3.
to kn^w God: but in this life we know him by faith, in the life to come by
vision: here, as it were in a looking-glass, and obscurely; there, face to
face: here we are in our (...), or growing age, wherein we must still grow
toward perfection: there we come to our (...) and perfection: here we lead a
mortal life; there an immortal. As therefore our mortal life is swallowed up
of immortality, whereby it is perfected, and our growing years by perfect age,
our obscure knowledge, and as it were in a glass, by intuitive aspect: so our
faith in the life to come is to be swallowed up in vision, and our hope in
fruition. For faith and hope are not of things seen and enjoyed. But when the
things believed are seen, and the things hoped for enjoyed; then are faith and
hope brought to their consumm^tion and perfection. Secondly, if our faith shall
be evacuated, as he speaks, in the life to come, that is an evidence that in
this life it is unperfect. The Apostle 1 Cor. 13. 8. says, that our knowledge,
meaning the knowledge of faith, shall be evacuated, or made void and of no
further use; for we know, says he, in part, verse 9. and we prophecy in
part, ^ Cor. 13. 9. 10. 11, 12.
but when that which is perfect is come, then that which is in part shall be
evacuated; that is, says Augustine, Lib. de perfect. justitiae.
ut (...) jam ex part sit sed ex toto: when I was a child, I spoke as a
child, I understood as a child, I reasoned as a child: but when I became a
man, I evacuated childish things: for now, to wit, by faith we see and know as
it were, in or by a looking-glass, and as it were in a riddle or in a d^rke
speech; but then we shall see face to face. Now I know in part, but then I
shall know, even as also I am known. If therefore faith shall be perfected by
vision, the consequence of the proposition with the proof thereof is to be
denied: and the evacuating of it by vision is a pregnant proof, that in this
life it is but in part. As touching the assumption I say, that faith, which is
the evidence of things not seen, and the substance of things hoped for, shall
never be perfected, until the things which are believed shall be seen, and
the things hoped for shall be enjoyed.

, III. His second reason to prove that faith may be perfect in this His second
reason because it is more precious than gold.
life is this: because, that faith, which has been tried in the for^ace of
temptation, is perfect, whereto if he assume, that the faith which in
justification is first infused, either in infants when they are baptized, or in
others in their first justification, has been tried in the Furnace of
temptation, he shall be ridiculous: for it must be, before by trial it be
approved. but supposing him to speak of the faith of men being adulti and
already justified: his impertinent proof stands thus. That faith, which is
more precious than gold tried in the fire, is perfect: That faith, which has
been tried and approved by temptation, is more precious than gold tried in the
fire, witness Saint Peter, 1 Epist. 1. 7. therefore that faith is perfect.
Answ. The proposition is to be denied. For temptations and afflictions are
trialls, not of the perfection, but of the soundness and unfainednesse of
faith. All faith, which is (...) that is, true and unfeigned, though not
perfect, endures temptations. Heresies are trialls, whereby (...), 1 Cor. 11.
19.
not the perfect but the sound and upright Christians may be known. Affliction
works patience, Romans 5. 3, 4.
and patience works (...) probation, that is shows them to be (...) that
is sound and approved, who patiently bear afflictions. Wherefore blessed is
the man Iam. 1. 1^.
that endures temptation, (...), because when he shall be found (...) that
is, not a perfect, but a sound and approved Christian, he shall receive the
Crown of life. Temptation therefore is fitly called Iam. 1. 3. 1 Pet. 1. 7.
(...) the trial of our faith, because it tries those who profess the faith,
whether they be (...) sound and upright Christians, or (...), that is,
hypocrites. But not all that be not perfect, are (...), nor any perfect though
(...) but all those that are not upright are (...) that is to say hypocrites.

. IV. His third reason: whosoever believe with all their heart, or His third
reason, because some believe with their whole heart.
their whole heart their faith is perfect: some do believe with their whole
heart, as namely, the Eunuch, Act. 8. 37. therefore the faith of some is
perfect. To help him, I will confess, that not only some, but all, who have
faith unfeigned, believe with their whole heart. But the proposition is to be
denied. For to believe with the whole heart, being not legally but
evang^lically understood, is to believe not with an heart Psalm. 12. 2. 1 Chro.
12. 33. 38 Hos. 10. 2.
and an heart: that is an heart divided, but with an entire and upright heart,
wherein there is no guile, Psalm. 32. 2. Ioh. 1. 47.
that is hypocrisy. So that he which believes integro cord with an upright
heart, or with faith unfeigned, is said according to the scriptures, to believe
with his whole heart; which proves not the perfection, but the soundness of
faith. Neither is it credible either that Philip would require perfect faith in
men before they be baptized, for to such Baptism were needelesse; or that the
faith of the Eunuch, being a new convert, not yet baptized, was at that time
perfect: For what I pray you was his faith? Was it not this, I Act. 8. 37, 38.
believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God: which is the very first degree
of justifying faith.

. V. His fourth reason, because the faith of Abraham was altogether His fourth
reason, because Abraham's faith was perfect.
perfect. What will he from thence infer? Ergo, the faith of all, when they
are first justified, is perfect? but he comes far short of that
conclusion. All that can be concluded, if the premises were true, is this.
Abraham had perfect faith; Abraham was justified, therefore some justified
person has a perfect faith The proposition he proves out of Romans 4. 19. 20.
where it is said that he was not weak in faith (as many are, who
notwithstanding are justified) neither staggered at the promise of God through
unbeleefe (as Zacharias did Luke 1. 20. who notwithstanding his unperfect faith
was a man justified) but was strong in faith, being fully persuaded and
therefore had (...) fidei the full persuasion of faith, (which few or none have
when they are first justified.) Now says he, this (...), is the perfection of
faith. Answ. first to the proposition, that Abraham's faith when he was first
justified, was not perfect, whatsoever it was afterward: secondly, to the
proof of it out of Romans 4. 20. 21. from which testimony it is indeed proved,
that the faith of Abraham, after he had been for a long time justified, was
strong, but not perfect. Neither is the (...), or full persuasion of this
point, that God is omnipotent, which here is adscribed to Abraham, the
perfection of faith; nor yet every full persuasion of the truth of God
concerning Christ. For first there is (...), Col. ^. 2.
which is a full persuasion of assent to any truth of God, but especially to
the truth, that Jesus the Son of the Virgin Mary is the eternal Son of God
and the Savior of all that truly believe in him: which, though it justify if
it be a lively and effectual assent, joined with an earnest desire and settled
resolution of application; yet is far from the perfection of faith. For there
is also Heb. 10. 22.
(...), the full persuasion of special faith, (which goes beyond the ordinary
faith of all Papists,) when thou certainly beleevest, not only that Christ is
the Savior of all the faithful, but also that he is thy Savior, and that by
him thou shall be saved. Now every assurance or assured persuasion is (...) of
which there are many degrees, through which we must strive, proceeding from
faith to faith, toward a full assurance: which yet is never so full, but that
still more and more may and ought to be added to it. As for Abraham, though his
faith were strong and excellent, yet was it not perfect: which appears by
many signs. For if his faith had been perfect, then it had not needed to have
been strengthened and confirmed. Why then did the Lord in every Chapter almost
of his story renew and repeat his promises unto him? Why did he confirm them
by oath? Why did he seal them by the Sacrament of Circumcision, which is the
seal of that righteousness which is by faith. How came it to pass, if
Abraham's faith was altogether perfect, that twice he used that unlawful shift,
which proceeded out of distrustful fear: calling his wife, his sister; whom,
to save his own life, he exposes to danger: for perfect faith expels fear
and distrust.

. VI. His fifth reason is besides the purpose. For whereas he His fifth and
sixth reasons.
should prove, that the faith of all the faithful is in their justification
perfect; he proves, that the faith of some special men, who are highly
commended in the Scriptures, as rare examples of a strong faith, was after they
had been justified, not a weak and a languishing, but a strong and valiant
faith: to which purpose he alleges. Heb. 11. 33. 1 John 5. 4. 1 Pet. 5. 9.
Ephesians. 6. 16. and thereupon infers: Surely that faith which can overcome the
world, resist the Devil, and repel all his fiery darts, must not be a weak
or languishing, but a strong and valiant faith. All which we grant. But yet
deny, either that it was so strong when they were first justified thereby, or
that, when it was at the strongest, it was perfect. But here, by the way, I
would feign know of Bellarmine and his consorts, whether this strong faith so
much commended in the Scriptures, be only a bare assent to the truth of the
word and promises of God, or rather an assurance, which we call special faith
grounded on the word and promises applied to our selves? In his last reason, he
urges again His sixth reason.
the force of the word (...) out of Heb. 10. 22. signifying, as he says, with
our consent, a most full and most perfect persuasion. We acknowledge that it
signifies a full persuasion, which we call assurance, which is so far from
being in all the Papists, when they are justified, as that none of them have it
at all without special revelation, which, they will confess, is very rare.
But yet of this assurance 1 These. 1. 5.
there are degrees; all aspiring in this life, but none attaining to
perfection: for when we have attained to some assurance, we must still labor
Phil. 3. 14.
to increase it, striving toward perfection. So much of Faith.

. VII. As touching Hope, (says he) the testimony of the Apostle, Heb. Of hope.
6. 19. may suffice: for there he says, that our hope must be the anchor, as
it were, of our soul, safe and sure. Answ. This argues the assurance of Hope
in some of Gods children after they have been justified, but not the
perfection. Sound Hope is safe and sure; because it never confounds or makes
ashamed, Romans 5. 5. where, by the way also, I would gladly learn, if there may
be such a full assurance of Faith and Hope, (as here Bellarmine affirms) and
that without special revelation; why there may not be the like assurance of
Salvation, and of perseverance to Salvation, which elsewhere he stoutly
denies, and by his denial confuteth his own assertion in this place: for if
there cannot be assurance of Salvation, much less can there be perfection of
Faith and Hope.

CHAP. VII. Bellarmines proofs, that Charity is perfect, disproved.

THere remains Charity, which he would prove to be His first reason that
ch^rity is perfect, from the testimony of Augustine.
perfect, not in all, and that in their first justification (which he ought to
prove, or else he proves nothing) but in some men in some part of their life
after their first justification: and this he proves, first by the testimonies
of Augustine, and after by authority of Scripture Out of Augustines book de
natura and gratia Aug de Not. and Gr. cap. 42.
, he cites two testimonies; the former in these words, ipsa charitas est
verissima, plenissima, perfectissimaque justitia: which Augustine does not
speak of Charity when it is infused in the act of justification, nor of
Charity in general, but of that perfect Charity whereunto nothing may be
added which he confesses to be the truest, the fullest, the perfectest
justice. The latter in these words, Ibid. cap. 70.
perfecta Charitas, perfecta justitia est: perfect Charity is perfect
righteousness; which we deny not. But that no man in this life does attain
to perfect Charity; Augustine, though he would not in that book dispute of the
possibility thereof (because God if he please is able to bestow perfect
justice, and to make men free from all sin) yet in other places he does
plainly and fully teach: as first Charity Epist. 29. ad Hieronym.
in some is greater, in some less (and therefore not perfect in all that are
jus^ified) in others none at all, but the most full and complete which now
cannot be increased, is in no man so long as he lives here. Now, so long as
it may be increased, assuredly that which is less than it ought to be, is a
fault. By reason of which default, there is not a righteous man upon the earth
that does good and sins not: for which default no man living shall be
justified before God: for which, if we shall say that we have not sin, we
deceive our selves and the truth is not in us: for which, though we be never so
good proficients, we must of necessity say, forgive us our debts. And in
another place: Tract. 41 in Joan.
In part there is liberty, in part bondage: as yet, no entire, no pure, no full
liberty. And after; let not sin reign in your mortal bodies, etc. he does
not say let it not be, but let it not reign. As long as thou live, sin
must needs be in thy members, only let the kingdom be taken from it.

. II. To this purpose a multitude of Testimonies might be cited Aug l^b de
perfectione iustitiae.
out his Book, De perfectione justitiae, which he wrote against Caelestius
the Pelagian, who held that men may attain to perfection in this life. I will
content my self with a few. Tunc erit plena justitia, quando plena sanitas,
quando plena charitas, plenitudo enim legis charitas. Tunc autem plena
charitas, quando videbimus cum sicui^ est. -- Charitas plena and perfecta tunc
erit, cum videbimus facie ad faciem. The Haec est nunc nostra iustitia qua
currimus, esur^entes ad pe^fectionem plenitudmemque justitiae, ut ea poste^
saturemur.
righteousness which we have here in our pilgrimage is to hunger and thirst
after righteousness, that hereafter we may be filled. -- Quotquot ergo
perfecti hoc sapiamus. id est, quotquot perfect currimus hoc sapiamus, quod
nondum perfecti sumus, ut illic perficiamur quo perfect adhuc currimus: ut cum
venerit quod perfectum est, quod ex part est destruatur, id est, non jam ex
part sit sed toto. quia fidei and spei res ipsa, non quae credatur, and
speretur, sed quae videatur teneaturque succedet: charitas a. quae in his
tribus major est, non auferatur sed augeatur and impleatur, contemplata quod
credebat, and quod sperabat indepta. In qua plenitudine charitatis praeceptum
illud implebitur, Diliges Dominum Deum tuum ex toto cord, etc. Nam cum est
adhuc aliquid carnalis concupiscentiae, quod vel continendo frenetur, non
omnimodo ex tota anima diligitur Deus. So much of Augustine. Testimonies of
Scripture alleged by Bellarmine, first, Ioh. 15. 13.


. III. Divine Testimonies (says he) we meet with every where. For first, our
Lord says. Greater charity has no man than this, that a man lay down his
life for his friends, Ioh. 15. 13. but it is evident, that very many, that is,
to say, all the Martyrs, have attained to this perfection of charity.

Answ. So to lay down a man's life for others, as Christ did lay down his for
us, is the perfection of Charity, But the love of Martyrs, though great,
comes far short of this perfection. For as in Joan. 15.
Cardinal Tolet has well observed upon this text, the quantity or measure of
charity may be considered three ways;

By way of

Estimation or appreciation. Intension. Extension.
In all which respects the love of Christ does far surpass the love of
Christ's love greater than that of Martyrs by way of appreciation.
Martyrs. First, by way of appreciation: because he gave that for us, which is
more and of greater value, than what is given by Martyrs. First, because of the
dignity of his person. For he being the great Tit. 2. 13. 14,
God and our Savior gave himself for us, and therefore gave for us a greater
gift, than all the Martyrs put together can give. Secondly, because where
Martyrs give their bodies only, that they may save their own souls: Christ
gave himself, that is both body and soul for us, that he might redeem both
our bodies and souls: which both he did assume, that he might give both for
us: not only in his body suffering death even the death of the Cross, but in
his soul undergoing, as our surety, the wrath of God for us; the fear whereof
brought him into that agony which made him sweat drops of blood, and the sense
of it upon the Cross made him cry out, My God my God, why have thou forsaken
me? being for a time, in his own sense, as a man separated from God, which
separation from God is the death of the soul. Now that Christ did thus far
give his soul as well as his body for us, diverse of the Fathers, especially
those which confute the heresy of the Apollinarists (who denied that Christ
had an humane soul) do teach. Cyrill says, De recta fide ad Theodosiam.
that Christ gave his flesh a price of ransom for the flesh of all, and his
soul likewise a price of ransom for the souls of all. Theodoret, (...)
dialog. 3. (...).
the good Shepherd gave his body and soul for his sheep, who have both body
and soul. And again, the nature of men consists of body and soul, both
which being lost by sin our Lord having taken upon him both, (...) for our
bodies he gave his body, and for our souls also his soul. Irenaeus, Advers.
haeres. lib. 5.
that Christ redeeming us by his blood, that is, by the sufferings of his
manhood, gave his soul for our souls, and his flesh for our our flesh:
Ambrose De (...)* Do ^nicae Sacram c. 6.
the Divinity of the Word was not offered in sacrifice for that which he had
put on: he offered in himself* and he put on that which before he had not,
that is, his whole manhood. For Christ our Priest both God and man upon the
Altar of his Deity (for it is the Altar which sanctifies the sacrifice) did
offer his whole manhood consisting both of body and soul as a whole burnt
offering for us. Whereas therefore in the Doctrine of redemption mention is made
either of his body alone* as Col. 1.22. 1 Pet. 2.24. or of his soul only, as
Esa. 53. 10, that his soul was made an offering for sin, and in this place,
Ioh. 15. 12. greater love has no man than this, that a man lay down (...),
animam suam, his soul for his friends: we are, by a Synechdoche, to
understand the whole manhood, that is, himself, as he was man. Now it is a
greater love for a man to give both body and soul for another, than to give
his body only.

. IV. Secondly, in respect of intension, it argues greater love, Christ's love
greatet than that of Martyrs by way of intension.
when a man is willing, of his own accord, and desirous to lay down his life
for others: than when necessity is laid upon him. Christ was willing Luk 9. 51.
of his own accord yea and earnestly desirous (for so he says, Luke 22. 15.
(...)) to lay down his life for us. Martyrs do not, yea ought not,
ordina^ily, offer themselves to death, for, qu^ amat periculum peribit in eo;
and our Savior has taught them, when they are persecuted in one city to flee
to another. But they are and ought to be willing to lay down their lives
rather than deny The Truth. Our Savior prophesying of Saint Peter's Martyrdom,
John 21. 18. says, when thou wast young, thou did gird thy self and walk
whither thou would: but when thou shall be old, thou shall stretch forth thy
hands and another shall gird thee, and carry thee whither thou would not.
Again, when a man does lay down his life freely, as Christ did, without
either tie of duty, or expectation of recompense, it argues greater love, than
what is so done out of duty, as that if he did it not, he should sin; and
so lose his soul Mat. 10. 39. 16. 25. Mar. 8. 35.
by seeking to save his life; or out of love to himself, to lay down his life
to save his own soul, which is the common case of Marty^s.

. V. Thirdly, in respect of extension: his love is greater that lays Christ's
love greater than that of Martyrs in respect of extension.
down his life not only for his friends and well willers, and such as have
been good unto him: for pe^adventure for such, as the Apostle says. Romans 5.
7. some, though hardly, would adventure to dye, (and some few examples in that
kind we read of) but also for sinners and for his enemies, who though they do
not love him, yet are beloved of him, and therefore in respect of his affection
are his friends, as beloved of him, though in respect of their affection,
enemies. Thus our Savior having loved us, commends his love toward us, Romans
5. that when we were sinners, verse 8. and by our sins enemies, verse. 10. he
dyed for us. But Martyrs when they dye for others, they lay down their lives
not for their enemies but for their brethren in Christ, 1 John 3. 16.

. VI. His second proof is out of 1 Ioh. 2. 5. He that keeps the His second
proof. 1 Ioh. 2. 5
Word of God, in him verily the love of God is perfected. But that the Word of
God may be kept, the same Apostle in the same Epistle teaches, 1 Ioh. 5. 3.
and his Commandments are not grievous unto us. Answ. The keeping of the
Commandments being an effect and fruit of Love, Charity is said to be
perfected by it, that is, perfectly known, as a good Tree by his fruit* and as
Faith is said, Iam. 2. 22. to be made perfect by good works: and as Gods
strength is perfected in our weakness 2 Cor. 12. 9.
for hereby men are known to love God, if they keep his Commandments, Exodus
20. 6. John 14. 15. 1 John. 5. 3. If any man say he loves God, 1 John 2. 3, 4.
and keeps not his Commandments, he is a liar, that is to say an hypocrite,
whose love is not sincere and (...), but fained and counterfeit. Now they are
said to keep Gods Commandments, not who perfectly fulfill them, for such
keepers of the Law are no where to be found; but such as keep them with their
soul, Psalm. 119. 167. or with their whole heart, Psalm. 119. 34. that is with a
sincere and upright heart. They therefore who have an upright desire, an
unfeigned purpose, a sincere endeavor to walk in the obedience of all Gods
Commandments, are said to keep them. This studium piet^tis is the perfection
of a Christian in this life; which whosoever has attained unto, is most
willing and ready to acknowledge his imperfection. His third proof Eccl. 47. 8.


. VII. His third proof is out of such places as speak of performing of
duties, as namely of loving God, with the whole heart, as Ec^l. 47. 8 David
praised the Lord with his whole heart, and loved him that made him. Deuteronomy. 30.
6. this perfection of Charity is promised: the Lord will circumcise thine heart
and the heart of thy seed, that thou may love the Lord thy God with all thine
heart and with all thy soul. Answ. By that phrase, as I have said, nothing
else is meant, but the integriry and uprightness of heart. David praised God
with his whole heart, that is Psalm. 119. 7. with uprightness of heart: he
served God with his whole heart, that is, he walked before him in truth and
uprightness of heart, 1 King. 3. 6.

. VIII. In the fourth and last place he produces those places His fourth
proof. Places which mention perfection.
wherein mention is made of perfection, as Mat. 5. 48. Be you perfect as your
heavenly Father is perfect. The Apostle acknowledges himself and some others
to be perfect. 1 Cor. 2. 6. we speak wisdom among those that are perfect.
Phil. 3. 15. so many of us therefore as are perfect, etc. Now says he, it is
evident that perfection (...) in Ch^rity, for as much Answer general.
as it is the bond of perfection. Col. 3. 14. Answ. First, in general to all
such places, by distinguishing perfection: for there is a perfection in respect
of parts, and so an infant having all his parts, is a perfect man. And such are
all upright persons, who walk in all Gods Commandments, making Conscience of
all their ways: and there is a perfection in respect of degree, which no man
attaineth unto in this life. Again, there is an absolute perfection, which
none attain unto here; and a relative perfection in relation and comparison to
others: so those who are adulti grown men in religion, are called perfecti, in
respect of babes. Thirdly, there is a perfection legal, which in respect both
of parts and degrees is absolutely conformable to the Law, which is the perfect
rule of righteousness. Of this, there is no example, but Christ himself: and
there is a perfection evangelicall, commended in the covenant of Grace, which
consists not in the perfect and total performance, but in the integrity and
uprightness of the heart, that is, in the sincere desire, unfeigned purpose and
upright endeavor aspiring toward perfection, which in the Scriptures in many
places goes under the name of perfection, as I have showed else where; so that
what is done with an upright heart, is said to be done with a perfect heart,
and with the whole heart, and the man who is upright, though subject to many
imperfectious, is called perfect.

. IX. To the places in particular I answer, and first to that Matthew. Answer
particular to Mat. 5. 48.
5. verse last: which, according to the wicked Doctrine of the Papists, is not
a precept of Charity, but a counsel of perfection; which does not belong to
all that are justified, bu^ is peculiar to those, who profess themselves to
live in a state of perfection. I call it wicked, because as appears, verse
45. our Savior requires this perfection, as a necessary duty to be performed
of all the Sons of God, who are to imitate the unpartiall bounty of God their
heavenly Father in do^ng good both to good and bad, which in this conclusion,
in Matthew is termed to be perfect, and in Luke 6. 36. to be merciful, as our
Father is merciful. But though we imitate this unpartiall bounty of God; yet
it does not thereupon follow, that we have attained to the perfection thereof.

. X, In the other two places, by men perfect are understood adul^i Answer to 1
Cor. 2. 6. Phil. 3. 15.
grown men, opposed to younglings and infants: who must be sedde with milk,
being not capable of strong meat: for every one that uses milk is unexpert in
the word of righteousness, for he is (...) a babe: but strong meat (which 1
Cor. 2. 6. is called wisdom) belongs to them that are (...) adulti, who are
come to years of difcretion, evensuch as by reason of use have their senses
excercised to discern both good and bad, where (...) and (...) are opposed: so
1 Cor. 14. 20. be not (...) children in understanding, howbeit in malice be
ye (...) but in understadning be (...) that is, adulti, such as are come to
years of discretion and understanding. Not that any in this life (wherein we
are always in our (...) that is, our growing age, wherein we are to be renewed
from day to day) do attain to that ripeness of age and stature, or to that
perfection of growth, as that we should not need to grow any more. For, as the
Apostle shows in the next place, viz. Phil. 3. 15. which Bellarmine had cited
against himself, if he had recited the whole verse, and Phil. 3.
much more if the whole v. 12. 13, 14, 15
context: wherein the Apostle confesses of himself, that he had not attained
to perfection, but that he did strive and preasse toward it: and thereupon
infers, verse 15. Let us therefore, so many as are perfect, be thus minded,
that is, as we heard before out of Augustine, De perfect. iustit.
let us be of this mind, that we are not yet perfect, but still should strive
toward perfection. And whereas the Apostle, Col. 3. 14. calls charity the
bond of perfection; his meaning is, that it is the most perfect bond, which is
among men to unite them together: for according to the Hebrew phrase (which is
usual in the writings of the Apostle) vi^culum perfectionis is vinculum
perfectissimum, qu^ plures inter se colligantur: for it is not (...) but (...),
that is, as Cajetan speaks vinculum conjungens amantes, or as B. In
paraphrasi.
Justinian, perfectissimum quoddam vinculum.

. XI. From these weak premises Bellarmine infers a stout conclusion.
Bellarmines conclusion.
If, says he, we may have perfect Faith, Hope, and Charity, and consequently
perfect inherent justice; in vain d^ the heretics g^e about to prove
imputation of righteousness, as though by no other means we could be simply
and absolutely just. I answer, though in some part of our life, after we have
been good proficients in Christianity, we might seem to attain to that
perfection whereof he dreameth; yet this would not prove that we are
justified by a perfect righteousness inherent. For that which Papists call
their first justification, being the justification, of a sinner (whereof this
question is to be understood) is of Incipients, such as be infants in age, or
at least in religion who are far from the perfection of inherent justice. But
if in no part of this life we cannot attain to the perfection of justice,
then must the imputation of Christ's righteousness be acknowledged to be so
necessary to justification, as that without it we cannot be justified.

CAP. VIII. The rest of Bellarmines arguments against imputation of De iustif.
l. 2. c. 7.. Quart^.
Christ's righteousness, answered.
. I.

IN the fourth argument, Bellarmine, whiles he Bellarmines fourth argument;
that we are not by Christ's righteousness formally just.
fights with an idle fancy, which like a man of straw he has set up
against himself, he yields, (such is the force of ever-prevailing verity)
to the truth. The man of straw is, that Christ's righteousness is so imputed to
imputed to us, as that thereby we are formally See Lib. 1. c. 5.. 2.
righteous: which never any of us (for ought I know) affirmed, who hold it an
absurdi^y, that the righteousness, whereby we are formally and by consequent
inheren^ly just, should be without us; as (indeed) the imputed righteousness
of Christ is out of us in him. But against this larva Bellarmine fights, that
if we being formally unjust by inherent unrighteousness, should also be
formally just by Imputation of that righteousness which is without us: there
we ought not to be called just, but unjust: as an Ethiopian clothed with
white is to be called black: because the denomination is to be taken from the
inward form, rather then from the outward. I answer, that so many as are
justified, are also sanctified: and that so many as are justified and
sanctified are neither to be termed formally unjust by the remnants of
original sin remaining in us, nor formally just by Christ's righteousness
imputed. For though it be true, that in respect of sin remaining and
inhabiting in us, we are according to the sentence and rigor of the Law,
sinners: yet we are, according to the doctrine of the Gospel, to be called
just, and that by a twofold justice. First and principally, by the perfect
righteousness of Christ imputed, by which we are justified and do stand
perfectly righteous before God in Christ, being made, as the Apostle speaks,
2 Cor. 5. 21.
the righteousness of God in him. Secondly, by a righteousness begun, by
which we are, not justified, but in some measure sanctified: which, though it
be unperfect by reason of the flesh ever accompanying it (for the best of us
are but partly Spirit, and partly flesh:) yet from it the denomination is to be
taken, as from the better part: and so the Scriptures call Job, and others
just, who notwithstanding acknowledged themselves to be sinners. And indeed the
more righteous a man is, the more does he acknowledge Romans 7. 24.
and feel his own sinfulness: which is a truth confessed by some of the
Papists themselves, as I showed before out of Cardinal Contarenus.

. II. Now let us see what Bellarmine yields. If they did not hold,
Bellarmines consession.
says he, that we are formally righteous by Christ's righteousness, but their
meaning only were, that Christ's merits are imputed to us, because they are
given unto us of God, and we may offer them to God for our sins, because Christ
took upon him the burden of satisfying for us, and of reconciling us to God,
recta esset eorum sententia, they should hold that which is right: Now I
assume, but we do not hold that we are formally righteous by Christ's
righteousness imputed: but our meaning only is, that Christ's merits, as namely
his sufferings and obedience are imputed unto us, and that they are given and
communicated unto us of God, namely by imputation, the Lord accepting of them
in our behalf, as if we had performed the same in our own persons, etc. I
conclude therefore, that by Bellarmines own confession, we hold the right.
And yet, this is that, which he does mainely oppugn in his whole disputation,
by all the rest of his arguments. If the Papists would sincerely and constantly
hold themselves to that, which Bellarmine here yields, there should not need
to be any controversy between us in this behalf. For as they would
confess, that we are justified by the merits of Christ imputed: so we would
profess, that by righteousness inherent received from Christ we are in some
measure sanctified. But what soever confession the truth has expressed from
Bellarmine here, and in some other places: yet he and all the rest of them
mainely oppose the imputation of Christ's righteousness, and wickedly deride
it, stiffly maintaining, that they are justified by righteousness inherent, by
which also they hope to merit eternal life. B^llarmines fifth argument: that
we should be as righteous as Christ himself.


. III. In this fifth argument he does again deprave our assertion, as though
we held, that Christ's righteousness were so imputed to justification, as if
it were our inward and formal righteousness: and thereupon infers, that,
if that be true, then ought we to be held and esteemed as righteous, as Christ
himself: and therefore (...), ought to be called redeemers and Saviors of the
world: and such like. Answ. We do not hold that we are justified by the
righteousness of Christ as our formal justice: neither does it follow upon
our assertion, that we are as righteous as Christ h^mselfe, and much less that
we are redeemers and Saviors of the world. For we do acknowledge a great
difference and disproportion between the Head, who is absolutely just of, in,
and by himself, and the members, who are not just either of, in, or by
themselves, but by his righteousness freely and undeservedly communicated to
them, being sinners in themselves; who being justified and redeemed by
imputation of Christ's righteousness, are thereby proved not to be redeemers,
but the redeemed of the Lord. But of this argument I have spoken sufficiently

imputed righteousness.
heretofore.

. IV. His sixth argument is thus fr^med: what we lost in Adam we receive in
Christ: which he proves out of I^enaeus and Augustine.

Imputed righteousness we did not lose in Adam, but that inward
righteousness in which we are created according to Gods image in holiness and
righteousness:

Therefore imputed righteou^nesse we do not receive by Christ, but
righteousness inherent.

Answ. This Syllogism is a mere Paralogisme, the assumption thereof being
negative in the first figure, as they call it. As if I should argue thus: Every
good Logician is, (...), a reasonable creature:

Bellarmine is not a good Logician, because in the first figure he assumeth
negatively, therefore he is not a reasonable creature:

But if he would argue thus: what Adam lost we receive in and by Christ, and
what Adam lost not, we do not receive by Christ: Adam lost inherent
righteousness, and not imputed: Therefore by Christ we receive inherent
righteousness and not imputed: Then would I deny the latter part of the
proposition: for we do receive by Christ more than we lost ^n Adam.

Adam was mutable, and the graces, which he had, were not without repentance:
But Christ makes the faithful Prosper. de voc. beat. l. ^. c. 24.
inseparabiles, id est, usque in finem perseverantes, and the saving graces
which we receive by him Romans 1^. 29.
are (...), hoc est, says Depraedest. 55. c. 16.
Augustine, sine mutatione stabiliter fixa. Adam lost an earthly Paradise, but
by Christ we receive an inheritance in heaven. Adam stood righteous before God
in his own righteo^snesse; but we stand righteous before God in the
righteousness of Christ, which far surpasses the righteousness of Adam,
etc.

. V. H^s seventh argument: If by the righteousness of Christ imputed
Bellarmines seventh argument: if by imtation we be just then Christ is a
sinner.
unto us we may truly be said to be just, and the sons of God* then by our
sin imputed to Christ, he may in like manner be tr^ly called a sinner, and,
which is horrible to think, the son of the devil: but the latter is
blasphemous, therefore the former. Answ. The proposition contains a double
consequence: which is to be distinguished. The first, if by the righteousness
of Christ imputed to us, we may truly be said to be righteous, then Christ
by imputation of our sin, may truly, though not formally be called a sinner:
but the consequent is fal^e, therefore the antecedent This proposition I grant,
as being firmly grounded on, 2 Cor. 5. 21. Vid. supr. l. 5. c. 1.. 4. etc.
and I do confess, that Christ was so made sin, that is, a sinner for us,
as we are made in him the righteousness of God; that is, righteous by the
righteousness of him, who is God, that is to say, by imputation. But the
assumption I do deny. For it is most tr^e, and no dishonor to Christ our
Blessed Savior, but that which wonderfully sets forth his unspeakable
goodness and love toward us* that he, which knew no sin, but was in
himself most holy and righteous and blessed for evermore; by taking upon him
our sin, and by undertaking, as our surety, our debt, was content to be
reputed, and by imputation made a sinner, that is, guilty of sin, and
accursed, and accordingly punished as a sinner, that we might be made righteous
and happy in him. Thus the Hebrews call them, that are punished, sinners, 1
King. 1. 21. and that those are freed from punishment, innocent, Genesis 44. 10.
But the other part of the consequence (if we by imputation of Christ's
righteousness become the sons God, then, which I abhor to speak, Christ
by imputation of our sins should be made the Son of the devil) I utterly
deny. For though to be made the child of God, is a consequent of being made
righteous by imputation, adoption going always with justification: yet to
become the child of the devil is no consequent of being made a sinner by
imputation, in respect of him who is most righteous and holy in himself. For
to undertake the burden of others men's sins, and to be willing to have them
imputed to him, being himself most righteous, is the property of the
immaculate Lamb of God Joh. 1. ^9.
who took upon him the sin of the world; and for that cause is most worthy to
be Apoc 5. 12.
accounted just, and to be acknowledged the Son of God. For he that
satisfies for others, is most just, says De iustif. l. 2. c. 10.
Bellarmine.

. VI. Upon this Syllogism Bellarmine infers another. If therefore
Bellarmines second syllogism, that after justification we are called just.
Christ, says he, because in himself he was holy, was called not a sinner
but just, though our sin was imputed to him: then by the like reason we, i^
after our justification we were indeed sinners and unclean in our selves,
should not be called just, but unjust, though Christ's righteousness be imputed
to us. But the Scriptures after the l^ver of regenerati^n (he might better
have said after regeneration it self) calls us righteous and holy and the
sonn^s of God, as appears by many places. These are the premises. The
conclusion should be this; Therefore after our justification we are not indeed
sinners and unclean in our selves. But in stead of that Pharisaicall
conclusion, he concludes thus: therefore we are not justified by imputation of
Christ's right^ousnesse, but by that righteousness it self which is inherent
and abiding in us: which conclusion is neither it self deduced from these
premises, neither is it a consectary of that which ought to have been the
conclusion. For although, after our justification we be, as before we were
not, righteous, and that by righteousness inherent, as Abraham was, and all
the faithful are; yet it does not follow, that we are justified thereby. For
our inherent righteousness is a consequent of our justification, and not a
cause thereof, not going before justificandos, but following justificatos. But
to this Syllogism, first, I return the like. If Christ, though most righteous
in himself, was not only accounted, but really punished as a sinner, yea made
2 Cor. 5. 21.
a sinner and a Gal. 3. 13.
curse for us, by taking upon him our sin, which as our debt was laid upon
him, as our surety, and imputed to him: then by the like reason we, though
sinners in our selves, are by imputation of his righteousness made righteous
before God in him: as before has evidently been proved Supr. c. 1.. 4. etc.
out of 2 Cor. 5. 21.

. VII. Secondly, as Christ, though ou^ sins were imputed to How we are called
just.
him, was called holy and just, because he was so in himself: So we though
Adams transgression was imputed unto us, and the corruption, which he
contracted was derived unto us, and ever dwells in our mortal bodies: yet
being once justified by Christ, are notwithstanding that habitual sin
inhabiting in us, and these actual transg^essions which through humane frailty
we daily commit, in regard whereof we are by the verdict of the Law, sinners;
we are, I say, termed just, and that in two respects: first, and principally in
respect of our justification, wher^in we were made just by imputation of
Christ's righteousness: secondly, in respect of our regeneration, whereby
inherent righteousness is begun in us. And howsoever in the regenerate man
there is both the flesh and the Spirit, the Old man and the New, in regard
whereof he may in diverse respects be termed, either a sinner in respect of the
flesh and the fruits thereof, according to the sentence of the Law, or a
righteous man in respect of the Spirit and the fruits thereof, according to the
doctrine of the Gospel: yet the denomination is taken from the better part, as
an heap of wheat and chafe, wherein perhaps is more chafe than wheat, is
called an heap of wheat; and a wedge of gold, wherein perhaps there is more
dross than pure metal, is called a wedge of gold, as I have said. And
whereas upon his premises this conclusion is inferred, therefore after the
laver of regeneration we are not vere and indeed sinners, nor unclean in our
selves, you may see what Pharisaicall conceit the Papists have of themselves,
that being once ex opere operato justified by their Sacraments, though they
neither have knowledge, nor faith, nor repentance, nor any sanctifying grace in
them: yet they are not truly and indeed sinners in themselves, neither is
there any sin in them. And therefore, unless they will play the hypocrites
and dally with God, they ought not to pray, as Christ taught his own Apostles
to pray, forgive us our sins. But by saying there is no sin in themselves,
it is evident, that there is no truth in them, 1 loh. 1. 8. His eighth argument
out of the Canticles: the S pouse of Christ beautiful in herself.


. VIII. His eighth argument is taken out of the Canticles, where Christ is
compared to the Husband or Bridegroom, the Church or justified soul to the
Spouse: which Spouse is said to be most fair and beautiful, yea, tota
pulchra, viz. by beauty inhere^t in her self, and not by the beauty of her
Husband imputed to her. Answ. From allegorical Scriptures no sound argument
can be drawn; especially, when they are not understood. But be it, that by
the Spouse is meant the Church of Christ. Is it the Church triumphant, as it
mayseeme, when she is said to be tota pulchra? then is it to no purpose
alleged. As for the Church militant, that commendation cannot be verified of
it, by reason of many deformed members, which be always in the visible Church,
besides which the Papists acknowledge no other. But if the Church militant be
meant, then of what time? for it may not be thought, that what is spoken in the
Canticles does agree to the Church at al times. The Spouse, which sometimes is
said to be tota pulchra, in other places is said to be black: sometimes She
enjoyethher Beloved, sometimes She is at a loss: sometimes she adhereth to her
Love, sometimes She neglects him. But suppose, she be always and altogether
beautiful, (which me thinks should hardly be verified of the Church of Rome,
besides which they acknowledge no other true Church; especially, when the
visible Head thereof, the Popes, have been monsters of men, their Clergy
Sodomiticall, their Laity void of all truth and power of Religion, their whole
Church in respect of her faith heretical, in regard of her religion
idolatrous, and in respect of both, apostaticall,) but suppose, I say, the true
universal Church, which is the company of the elect, to be wholly beautiful?
This total beauty cannot be understood of her inherent righteousness which is
stained and unperfect, but of that righteousness which her husband has
imputed and imparted to her, as we heard before Snpr. c. 4. n. 3. Bellarmines
proofs that the Spouses beauty is her own.
out of Gregory Nyssen.

. IX. Yea, but Bellarmine will prove that this beauty is inherent, first,
because her beauty is described as that which is proper to women; and his as
that which is proper to men: and therefore that his beauty is one, and hers
another. Secondly, because it is absurd to imagine (he absurdly charge us)
that the Spouse of Christ is deformed in herself, being only adorned
outwardly with her Husbands garment. But this labor Bellarmine might have
spared. For we do acknowledge, that the true Church is beautiful, and that
by a twofold beauty; the one, the perfect beauty of her Husband communicated to
her by imputation; the other unperfect and inherent; which being but begun in
this life is to be perfected in the life to come: but howsoever this inward
beauty be unperfect, yet because it is upright, her Husband is delighted Psalm.
51. 6. 45. 11. 13,
therewith, and in regard of this inward uprightness and integrity, she is
said to be glorious within. In which respect the Tabernacle of the Congregation
was a fit type of the Church militant, which in outward appearance is black and
brown like the tents Cant. 1. 5
of Kedar, but within, fair and beautiful like the hangings of Solomon; even
as the tabernacle, which outwardly made but a homely show, being covered with
Rams skins and Badgers skins, was inwardly glorious: we acknowledge
therefore, that there is inherent righteousness in the true Church and in all
the true and lively mem^ers thereof. In regard whereof, in the Creed we
profess our selves to believe, that she is holy, and that the communion of her
members among themselves, and with their head, is the communion of Saints. But
that by this inherent righteousness, either the Church or any member thereof
is justified before God, we do utterly deny.

. X. His ninth and tenth arguments I will put together: because His ninth
^rgument: (...) the heart must be clean before it can ice God. tenthly,
because Christ redeemed us that we might be holy.
one answer may serve for both. His ninth reason is this: by justification the
heart is cleansed, that it may be prepared for the vision of God; for until it
be clean, it cannot see God. The tenth, Christ suffered and gave himself for
his Church, that he might sanctify it, Heb. 13. 12. Ephesians. 5. 26. Tit. 2. 14.
loh. 17. 19. which is not done by imputation, etc.

Both those objections arise from the wilful ignorance of the Papists, who
will not distinguish justification from sanctification. The righteousness of
sanctification, of which these places speak, we acknowledge to be inherent,
though that of justification be imputed: and that, (which I have showed
heretofore) as we are by justification entitled to the kingdom of heaven; so
by sanctification we are fitted and prepared for it. We confess, that the
heart must be clean and pure before it can see God: and that by sanctification
begun in this life the heart is prepared, but never fully cleansed until it
come to see God: we acknowledge, that our sanctification is the end, not only
of our redemption, but also of our Election, Ephesians. 1. 4. of our creation, and
recreation according to Gods image, Ephesians. 4. 24. of our vocation 1 These. 4. 7.
of our justification and reconciliation, Col. 1. 22. Luke 1. 74. 75. That
sanctification is the way wherein men being elected, called, justified, are to
walk to their glorification. But though it be via regni, yet it is not causa
regnandi: that our Savior by his Spirit, does truly, really, and inherently
work the work of sanctification in all those that are justified. But I
beseech you what is the force of both these arguments? Our hearts must be
cleansed by inherent purity; therefore we are not justified by imputed
righteousness. Christ dyed and gave himself for us, that we might be
sanctified with true inherent grace: therefore we are not justified by
righteousness imputed. Christ gave himself for us Tit. 2. 14.
that he might redeem and justify us, that being reedeemed Luke 1. 74. 75.
and justified we might worship him in holiness and righteousness before him.

Finally, Bellarmine tells us, that many other arguments might be produced;
but these, he says, were the principal, which notwithstanding for the most
part were such as deserved with scome to be rejected, rather than to be in
good earnest refuted: which nevertheless argues not the insufficiency of the
disputant, but the badnesse of the cause, which admits no better proofs.

A TREATISE OF JUSTIFICATION.
THE SIXTH BOOK: Concerning Faith.
CAP. I. What Faith is; and that it is not without knowledge.
. I.

THE fifth Capital error of the Papists in the Article The Papists error
concerning faith.
of justification, is concerning justifying faith: which has many branches.

1. Concerning the nature of it, viz. what it is: and therein also they err
diversely. 2. Concerning the subject of it, both ^, and (...), that is the
parties whose it is, and the parts of the man, wherein it is. 3. Concerning the
object of Faith. 4. Concerning the act or effect of it, which is to justify:
where are three questions: the first, concerning the act it self, whether it
does indeed justify, or only dispose to justification; the other two,
concerning the manner how it justifies: the former, whether instrumentally, as
the hand to receive Christ, who is our righteousness; or formally, as part of
inherent righteousness. The other whether faith does justify alone.
. II. As touching the first, what faith is; they hold justifying faith What
faith is: how in general it may be defined.
to be but a bare assent, to all or any truth revealed by God: which, as it is,
in their opinion, without special apprehension of Christ* so it may be void of
knowledge, and severed from charity, as they teach.

That faith in general is an assent, and that it may be defined, to be a
firm and willing assent to every truth revealed by God, grounded on the
authority Faith is an assent. The Greek fathers make assent (...) the genus of
faith. Clemens Alex. Bas^. Theodoret. and Augustine says that credere est cum
assensu cogitare. de praedestin. 55. c. 2.
of God revealing it, we willingly agree. For hereby faith is distinguished
from all other acts or habits of our mind. And first, from doubting, in that
it is an assent: for in doubting the assent is withheld, which is (...) from
whence is (...), as contrariwise to assent Act. 16. 14.
is (...). And that faith is assent, it is evident, because (...) (faith) is a
persuasion, derived from the Verb (...).
(...), which signifies to be persuaded or to believe, and a man is said to
assent unto, or to believe that, of the truth whereof he is persuaded: hence it
is, that the act of faith, which is to believe, is expressed sometimes by the
Verb (...), Luke 16. 31. 20. 6. Romans 8. 38. 2 Tit. 1. 12.
Act. 17. 4. 27. 11. Heb. 11. 13. but most plainly, Act. 28. 24. (...). some
believed the things which are spoken, but some believed not. Secondly, from
opinion: in that faith is a firm assent, or, as Basil (...). c John 3. 33.
speaks, (...) an undoubted assent: for he that believes the truth of God,
has (as it were) put his seal unto it. But opinion is the judgment of things
contingent, which may happen to be false. Sed fidei falsum subesse non potest:
but the subject of faith cannot be false. Thirdly, in that it is a willing
assent, from the forced belief of Devils, and some desperate wicked men, who
believe that which they abhor, or as Saint James speaks believe and
tremble, Iam. 2. 19. Mat. 8. 29. Fourthly, from all other knowledge, in that it
is an assent to truth revealed or related by God, and grounded upon the
authority of God speaking in his Word, for faith comes by the hearing of the
word. So says Saint Romans 10. 17.
Basil (...) (...).
(...). Faith therefore is an undoubted assent of things heard in the assured
persuasion of things preached by the grace of God. And that is it which
Bellarmine cites out of Augustine De utilit. credendic. 1.
quod intelligimus aliquid, rationi debemus: quod autem credimus, authoritati:
that we understand any thing we owe to reason; but that we believe, to
authority. All other firm assent is given to things, either in themselves
evident to sense or reason, or to such as are manifested by discourse. But the
object of faith is not discerned by sense, nor sounded by reason (such as is
the mystery of the holy Trinity, and of the incarnation of Christ etc.) neither
is faith Heb. 11. 1.
of things seen. Eye has not seen 1 Cor. 2. 9. Esai. 64. 4.
nor Ear heard, neither have entered into the heart of man, the things which
God has prepared for them that love him. And whereas the certainty of all other
knowledge is grounded upon sense or experience, and reason: the certainty of
this knowledge is grounded upon the authority of God speaking in his word. For
which cause the certainty of faith is greater than of any other knowledge: For
howsoever sense and reason may be deceived: yet the ground of faith is
unfallible, which is the authority of God, who is Tit. 1. 2. Deuteronomy. 32. 4. Job.
14. 6.
(...), one that cannot lie, a God of truth, yea truth it self: whereupon
Clemens Stromat. l. 2.
Alexandrinus says: (...) Therefore it self is a firm demonstration, because
truth accompanies Faith those things which are delivered God, and Basil (...)
(...).
what is the property of faith? an undoubted plerophorie or full persuasion of
the truth of the words inspired of God, which is not shaken with any reasoning
either induced from natural necessity, or formed to piety. And such is the
certainety of faith, that the Apostle defines it Heb. 11. 1.
that it is (...). the subsistence, which gives a being, to things which now
have not a being, (which is nothing but an assured belief as the word is used,
2 Cor. 9. 4. 11. 17. Heb. 3. 14.) and the evidence of things not appearing, or
not seen: which the Greek Sholiast, (...). O^cum. That justifying faith is
not without knowledge.
in mine opinion, very well explaneth. Faith it self is the subsistence or
substance of things hoped for. For because those things which are in hope are
without subsistence, as yet not extant, faith becomes the substance and
subsistence of them, making them after a sort to exist and to be present,
because it does believe they are. Faith also is the evidence and demonstration
of things not seen. And faith shows things to be visible which are not
seen: How? in the mind and in hope beholding things which do not appear.

. III. But howsoever faith is an assent, and is in general so to be defined,
as I have said: yet justifying faith is not a bare assent, either destitute of
knowledge, or severed from charity, or without special apprehension and
application: for these are three errors of the Papists now in order to be
confuted. As touching the first: The Papists do not only hold, that
justifying faith may be without knowledge, but that also it may better be
defined by ignorance Bellarm. de ^ustif. l. ^. c. 7.. judicium. Of Implicit
Faith.
than by knowledge. This faith, which is without knowledge, they call implicit
faith: because they believing some one common principle, as namely, I believe
the b^ly Catholic Church, do thereby believe implicit, whatsoever is to be
believed, that is, whatsoever the Catholic Church believes and propounds
to be believed. And therefore this they call also an entire faith; because
thereby, a man does not only believe the written word but also unwritten
verities, which are the traditions of the Church of Rome, and both of them, not
for themselves, but for the authority of the Church propounding them to be
believed. Now they teach, that not only for Lay men it is sufficient to believe
as the Church believes which was the Colliars Fides Carbonarii.
faith so much commended by Cardinal Hosius Advers. prolegom. Brentii. De
authoritate Scripturae. l. 3.
and others (for he being examined by a learned man, what he believed,
answered: I believe that which the Church believes; and being asked what the
Church beleiveth, answered again, that which I believe: and so in a round,
that he believed what the Church believed; and that the Church believed as he
believed) but also that it is the safest for all, even for those that are
learned, to rest in this faith. Especially, when they are assaulted by Satan:
with whom they say it is not safe to contend by Scriptures, but rather to
oppose that only article against him. As the said learned man, who had opposed
the Collyar, found by experience. For he being afterward assaulted by Satan,
when he was deadly sick, and being not able to defend himself by Scriptures,
he was feign to b^ake himself to the Colliars faith, which no doubt is the
readiest way for them, who profess a faith not conformable to the Scriptures
to put the Devil to silence, who will rest well content with such an answer:
whereas if they should stand to the Scriptures the Devil would be able to
confute them. As he did Luther (whiles he was a Papist) in the question
concerning the private Mass, which he did, not to teach him the truth, but by
true accusations to bring him to despair.

. IV. This doctrine of the Papists concerning implicit faith, is The doctrine
of implicit faith confuted, first as false.
both absurdly false, and notoriously wicked. False, in diverse respects.
First, in that they say, justifying faith may be without knowledge: when as,
first of all, faith it self is a kind of knowledge; yea a kind of certain
knowledge: yea, of all others the most certain knowledge: as I have already
showed; proving, that it is that knowledge which we have by Divine relation or
report, grounded on the authority of God speaking in his word. Secondly,
because faith oftentimes in the scriptures is called knowledge, or
acknowledgment: as Ioh. 17. 3. This is eternal life to know thee the only
true God and Jesus Christ whom thou have sent. Now, we know God in the life to
come by vision, in this life by faith, as their own writers testify. Maldonat
Maldonet in Joan. 17. 3.
on that place: what is the cause says he, that he seems to place eternal
life in knowledge alone, that is in faith only? And Ianseni^s In Joan. 17. 3.
vita aeterna inchoative and imperfecte hic habetur cognoscendo Deum per fidem:
habetur autem in (...) perfect cognoscendo Deum per visionem. Esai. 53. 11. My
righteous servant by his knowledge or acknowledgement, that is, by faith in him
shall justify many. So 2 Pet. 1. 2, 3. Ephesians. 1. 17. Col. 1. 10. and 2. 2. 1 Timothy 2. 4. 2 Timothy 2. 25. 3. 7. Tit. 1. 1. where, by (...) the knowledge or
acknowledgement of Christ and his truth, is meant nothing else but faith, 1
Ioh. 2. 3, 4. hereby we do know, that we do know him, that is, believe in
him, if we do keep his Commandments: he that says he knows him, namely,
by faith, and keeps not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in
him. Heb. 11. 3. By faith we understand or know, that the worlds were formed by
the Word of God: where the act of faith is expressed by this term of
understanding that which we believe, 2 Cor. 5. 1. we know, (that is, we
believe, for otherwise it cannot be known but by faith) that after the
dissolution of our earthly tabemacle, we have an eternal habitation in heaven.
Thirdly, because in the Scriptures faith and knowledge are so linked together,
that what we acknowledge we believe; and what we believe we know, Ioh. 6. 69. we
believe and know that thou art that Christ, Ioh. 10. 38. that you may know and
believe that the Father is in me, and I in him. Ioh. 17. 8. they have known
surely, that I came out from thee (says Christ unto his Father) and they have
believed, that thou did send me. Ephesians. 4. 13. till we all come into the unity
of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God. 1 Timothy 4. 3. to be
received with thankesgiving of them which believe and know the truth, 1 Ioh. 4.
16. we have known and believed the love that God has to us. Fourthly it is
not possible that a man should believe, acknowledge, or assent firmly to that
which he does not know so much as by relation or hearesay, how can they believe
in him of whom they have not heard, and by hearing known, Romans 10. 14. And who
knows not, that the assent of faith determines the judgment to that
particular which is believed? As for example, if I believe the resurrection, my
judgment actually assenteth to that particular. But if I never have so much as
heard or understood that God has revealed such a thing that there shall be a
resurrection, how can I possibly believe it, or actually assent unto it. And
therefore implicit faith is so far from being a justifying faith that it is
not so good as the bare historical faith, which not only wicked men but the
Devils themselves have. For historical faith has in it an actual assent, and
implies a knowledge (at least by relation) of that which is believed. But
implicit faith has neither. Fifthly, to the implicit faith, the definition
offaith: Heb. 11. 1. does in no sort agree: for as it is so far from being
the substance of things hoped for, that it does not so much as know what are
the things hoped for, so it is further from being an evidence of things not
seen, which implies a certain knowledge of things by relation which are not
seen or known by sense or reason. Sixthly, that which implies a contradiction
is false and absurd: but the profession of the implicit faith made by a simple
man, viz. that he believes whatsoever the Catholic Church believes,
implies a contradiction: not only because he does not believe every, yea
scarce any particular, but also through his ignorance sometimes does actually
believe that which the Church does not believe; or does deny credit to that,
which the Church believes. But here now is the special privilege of
implicit faith: Gabr. Bicl. in 3. Sentent. did. 25. art. 1. not. 2. coroll 4.
In tantum valet fides implicita, ut dicunt aliqui, quod si habens eam
fa^soopinaretur Patrem majorem velpriorem filio, etc non peccat, dummodo ^unc
errorem pertinaciter non defindit, and hoc ipsum credit, quia credit ecclesiam
sic credere. Sic Innocent. Hostiensis Joan. Andreas Panormitanus in Rubric. de
summa Trinit. and fid. Cathol. Rosella fides nun. 2. apud Azor. inftit. moral.
lib. 8. c. 7. and 8. Gabr. Biel. in 3. Sent. did. 25. art. 3. dub. 1. Si quis
credit, putans ecclesiam sic credere etiamsi erroneum fuerit, non pecca^
dummodo tamen pertin aciter non ad^aeret. ui supra dictum notab. 2. Imo, quod
amplius est, haec fides meritum facit. Nam talis non solum non peccaret, sed
etiam sic creden do falsum mereretur. The second absurdity, that faith may be
better defined by ignorance than by knowledge.
that although a man believe an error, as that God the Father is greater than
the Son, or ancienter than he, or that the persons of the Trinity are divided
by local distance one from another, it is no offense, so long as he thinks,
the Church believes so: and so says Gabriel himself. If any man do believe
thinking that the Church does so believe; though it be erroneous he sins
not, so that he do not obstinately adhere to his error, as was said before,
notab. 2. Yea, says he, that which is more, this faith is meritorious: for
such an one should not only not sin, but also by so believing that which is
false he should merit. Thus not only he is said to believe who indeed does
not believe, nor give assent to the truth; but also he who dissenteth from the
truth, even from that which the Church does hold.

. V, Secondly, they are absurd, in saying, that faith may better be defined by
ignorance than by knowledge, For notitia (knowledge) is the genus both of faith
and of science, whereas ignorance is a privation of knowledge. It were
therefore very strange, if faith, which is an habit of the mind, should be
defined by a privation, and namely of that habit, which is the genus of it.

Yea, but (says Bellarmine) faith is opposed to science, and therefore better
to be defined by ignorance, than by knowledge. I answer, it is opposed to
science, not as a privation, that it should be defined by ignorance, but as a
species of the same kind (...) contra divided. for notitia as the genus is
divided into science and faith, the former, being a knowledge of things, either
manifest in themselves, which is called (...); or made manifest by discourse of
reason, which is called (...): the latter being a knowledge of things neither
manifest to sense nor reason, but known only by relation from God: where, by
the way, you are to observe that the knowledge required in faith is not (...)
of the cause, such as is in science, but only (...), which is to believe the
relation to be true, and that whatsoever God reveals is infallibly true. And
therefore by faith our judgments are captivated to yield assent to divine
revelations, though either they may be above reason, or may seem to be against
sense or reason. For though sense and reason may be deceived: yet the ground
of our faith, which is the authority of God, cannot be deceived, nec fidei
falsum subesse potest: neither can the subject of faith be false. As for
example: the mysteries of the Trinity, and of the incarnation of our Savior
be above our reason; the articles of the creation of all things from nothing,
and of the resurrection of the body seem contrary to reason, the article of
eternal life contains such things, as never eye did see 1 Cor. 2. 9.
nor ear hear, neither did they ever enter into the heart of man: and so of
other articles of Christian religion; which notwithstanding we do firmly
believe, and undoubtedly know to be true, as God has revealed the same,
grounding this our faith and knowledge on the authority of God speaking in his
Word. This distinction of knowledge being acknowledged, that the knowledge of
faith is neither the certain intelligence of things in themselves manifest to
sense or reason, nor that science which is (...) by the causes; or attained by
discourse of reason; but only (...) that the things revealed by God are
infallibly true by reason of his authority, who is Truth it self; might serve
as a sufficient answer to so many of Bellarmines arguments and allegations as
seem worth the answering. But I will briefly examine his proofs, which are
allegation of Scriptures, reason, and testimonies of Fathers. Bell. de justif.
l. 1 c. 7. Bellarmines proofs out of the Scriptures. The first out of Esa. 7.

. VI. As for his allegation of Scripture: the first place alleged out of Esa.
7. 9. is not, as Bellarmine alleges it, unless you believe you shall not
understand; but, if you believe not, you shall not be established or as the
vulgar Latin (which Bellarmine ought to stand to) non perm^nebitis: as
contrariwise, 2 Chronicles. 20. 20. if you believe in the Lord you shall be
established; or, as the Latin, securieritis. Neither does it follow, that
faith is not knowledge, because without faith we cannot come to the certain
intelligence of that which we believe. For, as knowledge of the thing revealed
goes before faith; so faith goes before the exact The second and third. 1
Cor. 13. 2. and 1 Cor. 12. 9.
understanding and comprehension. In the two next places, 1 Cor. 13. 2. and 12.
9. where faith, as he says, is distinguished as a several gift from
knowledge: by faith is not meant justifying faith, but the faith (...).

of miracles, as I have else where showed. Neither do we deny, but that
knowledge may be a distinct gift from faith. As that knowledge which is either
principiorum or conclusionum, which is (...). Neither is knowledge always
joined with acknowledgement which is faith: though acknowledgement implies
knowledge always. Knowledge therefore may be without faith, but faith cannot
be without knowledge. To the fourth out of 2 Cor. 10. 5. that where knowledge
is, there needs no captivating of the understanding. I answer, that faith
being only notitia (...), and giving firm assent to that whereof it knows
no reason, yea though perhaps it seem above or against reason, subjecteth or
captivateth the understanding to the authority of God. The last is The fifth,
where obedience of faith is mentioned.
from those places wherein the obedience of faith is mentioned. For, says he,
obedience in believing were not needful, if by faith knowledge were given to
men. I answer, that in those places faith does signify the doctrine of faith,
that is the Gospel, the truth, which men are then said to obey, Romans 10. 16.
Gal. 3. 1. Act. 6. 7. when they believe and profess it. As contrariwise those
who do not believe are said (...), to disobey, and that in opposition to
belief, Ioh. 3. 36. Act. 14. 2. and 17. 5. and 19. 9. Romans 11. 30, 31, 32. and
15. 31. Heb. 3. 18, 19. 1 Pet. 2. 7. Neither should it seem strange to
Bellarmine, that by faith men attain to knowledge, I mean to greater
knowledge, when he urging even now that place, Esai. 7. 9. said, faith is a
degree and way to knowledge. The testimonies of Fathers. Iraen. l. 2. c 45.
Melius est nihil omninoscientem credere Deo and perseverare in ejus dilectione
quae hominem vivificat, quam per qu^stionum subtilitates and multiloquium in
impietatem cadere. Thus cited by Bellarmine.


. VII. To the Testimony of Irenaeus, if it were entirely cited, I would
subscribe. For speaking of those words, 1 Cor. 8. Scientia inflat, dilectio
autem adificat, and having thereupon inferred, that it were better to know but
a little, and to love God, than in a conceit of great knowledge to be found
blasphemous against God; he repeateth the same again, Melius itaque est
sicuti predixi, nihil omnio scientem quempia^, ne quidem unam causam cujusllbet
eorum quae facta sunt, cur factum, and credere Deo, and persever are in ejus
dilectione quae honorem vivificat, nec aliud inquirere adscientiam, nisi I^SVM
Christum filium Dei; qui pro nobis crucifix^s est, quam per quaestionum
subtilitates and multiloquium in impietatem cadere. Where first observe, that
the knowledge whereof he speaks, is that whereby the causes or reasons of
things are known. And we do confess that a man may and ought simply to
believe God without such knowledge: and secondly, that he speaks by way of
comparison, that it is better for a man to content himself with the knowledge
of Christ alone joined with love (which is not to be accounted implicit faith,
for the Apostle himself determined to know 1 Cor. 2. z:
nothing among the Corinthians, but Christ and him crucified) than affecting
the knowledge of subtle and curious questions, to fall into impiety.

. VIII. The place in Clemens Alexandrinus makes wholly Clemens Alexandrin

against the ignorance of implicit Faith. For whereas one there excuses his
ignorance (as many now a days do) because he was not booke-learned, he
answers; though thou have not learned to read, yet (...). for hearing thou
can not be excused, because it is not to be taught. Now, says he, in the
words which Bellarmine cites, faith is a thing belonging to the wise, not
according to the world, but according to God (such as are taught of God) and it
is learned without letters. Faith therefore is to be learned, namely by
hearing, and therefore is a knowledge, and they attain unto it, who are not
worldly wise, but such as are wise according to God, and therefore such as have
knowledge. Neither can men, as he says, excuse their ignorance or their want
of faith, because they are not book learned, for though they cannot read, yet
they may hear, and by hearing Romans 10. 17.
faith comes.

. IX Hilarie inquiring how we should so be one in the Father and Hilari. l. 8.
de Trinitate.
in the Son, as the Father is in the Son, and the Son in the Father,
says; that in such mysteries habet non tam veniam, quam praemium, ignorare,
(that is, non intelliger^) quod credas, quia maximum stipendium fidei est
sperare quae nescias, it has not so much pardon as reward, not to know what
thou beleevest. For, it is the greatest stipend of faith to hope for those
things which thou understandest not. For as the Apostle says, they never
entered into the heart of man the things which God has prepared for us. And no
doubt, but it is a great commendation of faith, when a man gives glory to God,
undoubtedly believing that to be true, which God in ^he greatest mysteries has
revealed though he does not comprehend the reason thereof. The thing r^vealed
he believes to be true and ^o knows (...), though he do not distinctly,
exactly and clearly comprehend (...), the reason thereof, which he finds to
be incomprehensible.: What then, says Hilarie, is there no office of faith, if
nothing can be comprehended? Imo hoc officium fides profiteatur, id quod cred^
incomprehensibile sibi esse, se scire; yea, says he, let faith profess this
offic^, that it knows that thing to be incomprehensible to it self, which it
believes.

. X. Out of Augustine he cites five places, wherein he teaches Augustine.
nothing but what we freely confess, that the faithful (for he speaks not
particularly of the ignorant, but of all the faithful) believe those things
which they do not comprehend: or as he speaks in the first Epist. 102. ad
Evodium.
place quae certa intelligentia non possunt discernere, which by certain
intelligence they are not able to discern, which in the second Lib. 4 contr.
epist. fundamcap 4.
place he calls intelligendi vivacita^em, in the third Tract. 27. in Joan.
intelligentiam mysteriorum, which in the fourth place he shows not to go
before, but to follow after Faith. For first by rel^tion we know (...), what
God reveals, then we assent thereto, and having assented we come afterward
more dist^nctly to understand it. But he who seeks not only to know the
thing but the reason thereof, may as he says in the Sermon. de Temp. 189. qui
est de Trinitate.
fifth plac^, be called rationalis, that is a quaerist: whereas a faithful man
should say Nescio q^od credo, I understand not that which I believe. Vis scire*
says he, Naturam Dei, hoc scito quod nescias, will thou know the nature of
God? know this that thou know it not. For as elsewhere De Agone Christiani c.
13.
he says, debemus credere, quod intelligere nondum valeamus, quam verissime
dictum est per Prophetam nisi credideritis, non intelligetis. And in the Sermon
Sermon. de temp. 189.
even now alleged. Nobis sufficiat: Let it suffice us to know concerning the
Trinity, what God has vouchsafed to explain -- what Christ has been willing
to show, that only I know: when a thought shall arise and propound this
question, what is God, and what is the reason, that is, the proper nature of
the Trinity, let it suffice us to believe, that it is, (that is (...), and not
rashly seek the reason of the Trinity.

. XI. That which he cites out of Prosper, and is the same which Prosper. De
vita contempl. l. 1. c. 19.
even now I recited out of Augustine, is true, that faith goes before clear
understanding, and men must believe, that they may understand more clearly.
For, as he truly cites out of the Philosopher, addiscentem oportet credere,
the learner must believe: And as Augustine says of unbeleevers, non possunt
discere, quia nolunt credere, they cannot learn, because they will not
believe; and as the Apostle of the unbeleeving Israelites, that the hearing of
the word did not profit them, because it was not mingled Heb. 4. 2.
with faith. All this notwithstanding, no man can be said to have learned
that, which he did not first conceive and in some measure understand as it is
taught, (for (...) which is to learn, does also signify to understand) and
then believes that it is so: and so believing what is taught, grows more
distinctly and clearly to understand what he did believe. But they which have
but implicit faith, do not so much as know the particulars of the Catholic
faith, which are to be believed; so far are they from either learning or
believing them.

. XII. The brutish argument which he borrows from Gregor. Mor: l. 2. c. 25.
Gregory's allegory of the Oxen and Asses feeding together, Job 1. besides that
it is to no purpose, (because allegories, specially such as far fetched, and
not intended by the holy Ghost, prove nothing) is also depraved. For Gregory
does not say that by the Oxen are meant the learned, by the Asses feeding by
them, men unskilful and unlearned, who simply believing do rest in the
understanding of their betters: but that the Asses are said to feed with the
Oxen; because the more simple and dull, who are not capable of high points,
meant by the Asses; conversing with the prudent meant by the Oxen, are fed with
their knowledge or understanding.

. XIII. To these few and weak authorities, many pregnant testimonies of the
Fathers might be opposed, if it were needful. These few may suffice.

1. Hilarie: De trinit. l. 8.
Nec enim quisquam quod non sapit loquitur, nec quod loqui non potest, potest
credere. Neither does any man speak what he does not conceive, neither can he
believe that which he is not able to utter. 2. Hierome; Con^r. Luciferian.
quae est ista simplicitas, nescire quae credas? What silliness is this, not
to know the things which thou do believe? 3. Chrysostom; Homil. de bapt.
Christi.
having recited very many heads of Christian religion; all these, says he,
and many more a Christian must know, and of all these he must be able to
render a reason to them that ask it. 4. Augustine; August. in Psalm. 118. conc.
18.
although no man can believe in God unless he understand somewhat concerning
God, notwithstanding by that faith it self whereby he does believe, he is
healed, that he may understand greater matters -- our understanding therefore,
proficit ad intelligenda qua credat, and fides proficit ad credenda quae
intelligat, and eadem ipsa ut magis magisque intelligantur, in ipso intellectu
profioit men's: profits or is a proficient to understand what it may believe,
and our faith profits to believe those things which it may understand, and
that the same things may more and more be understood, in the understanding it
self the mind profits. 5. Cyril: Cyril. Alex. in Joan. l. 11 c. 16.
Faith, what is it else, but the true knowledge of God? 6. In the second tome
of Athanasius Athan. p. 248.
there is a discourse against those, who bidding men not to search the
Scriptures, but to b^ content with that faith which is among themselves (which
is the very case of the Papists at this day) shall (...);
I (says the author of that discourse) neglect the Scriptures? whence then
shall I have knowledge? shall I abandon knowledge? whence then shall I have
Faith? Paul cries out, how shall they believe, if they do not hea^e? and
again, faith is by hearing, and hearing by the Word of God: therefore he^ that
forbids the Word (...).
; stops up hearing, and expels faith. But, says he, a little after,
they who go about to establish their own opinions restrain men from the
Scriptures, in pretense that they would not have them to be so bold to have
access to them which are unacce ^ible, but in very truth, (...).
that they may avoid the con^utation of their wicked doctrine out of them. 7.
Fulgentius. ^ontr. Arianos.
Fulgentius: fides vera quod credit non nescit, etiamsi nondum potest videre
quod iper at and credit. True faith is not ignorant of that which it believes,
although as yet it is not able to see that which it does hope and believe. 8.
The master of the sentences: Fides non potest esse de eo quod omnino P. Lombard
l 3. Sent. did. 24. C.
ignoratur. Faith cannot be of that whereof a man is altogether ignorant. --
Neither can a man believe in God unless he understand somewhat, seeing faith
comes by hearing the Word preached. Nec ^a quae pr^us creduntur quam
intelliguntur penitus ignorantur, cum fides sit ex auditu. Ignorantur tamen ex
part quia non sciuntur. Neither are those things, which are believed before
they be understood, altogether unknown, seeing faith comes of hearing: yet
in part men are ignorant of them, because they have not the science of them. 9.
To these we may add the authority of the Creed it self, that is, as the
Papists themselves do teach, of all the Apostles consenting together: wherein
they thought it not sufficient to teach men to profess their belief in that
one article; I believe the holy Catholic Church, but in all necessary points
that are to be believed* first, concerning God, both in Himself, and in his
Works: in Himself; both in respect of the nature of the Deity, and of the
three persons in Trinity, the Father, the Son and the holy Ghost: in his
Works; of creation and government, and of redemption. Then, concerning the
Church and the several prerogatives thereof, viz. the Communion of Saints, the
forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and life everlasting And
further teach every particular Christian to say, and that with Christian
resolution, Credo I believe these particulars, which cannot be done either with
truth, if indeed he do not believe each particular; or with that (...), or
confidence which is meet, unless a man does not only believe all those
particulars, but also know that he does believe them. And lastly, by this
form of profession, I believe, they teach and confirm that of Habac. 2. 4.
that the just shall live by his own faith, and not by the faith of others.
. XIV. Now I come to Bellarmines reason, although I have already Bellarm.
reason.
answered it in part. In him that believes, says he, there are two things,
apprehension, and judgment or assent. Apprehension goes before faith and is
not knowledge, unless it be distinct and plain, and that is not needful to
faith. Now the judgment or assent, says he, is twofold: for either it
follows reason and the evidence of the thing, and is called knowledge, or
else the authority of the pr^pounder, and is called Faith. Therefore, says he,
the mysteries of faith, which surpass reason, we do believe, we do not
understand. And therefore faith is distinguished against science, and is better
defined by ignorance than by knowledge. Answ. This discourse is to prove that
faith may be without knowledge: for whereas two things concur to faith,
apprehension and assent, knowledge is required in neither, etc. But I answer,
that these things are not well distinguished by Bellarmine. For first,
apprehension or conceiving of the object is the common act of the
understanding, going before all judgment of the understanding 1.
whatsoever. For it is not possible, that the understanding should judge of
that, which it has not apprehended or conceived. And yet, behold, implicit
faith is so far from being a true justifying faith, that it has not so much
as this first and common act of the understanding in it. For it does not so
much as apprehend or conceive the particular things to be believed* Secondly,
judgment and assent are not to be confounded. 2.
For judgment is more general, and belongs to those things that we do not
assent unto, as well as to those which we do. For when we have in our mind
apprehended, conceived, or understood any proposition, or thing propounded;
then we judge of it, either as false, and then we dissent from it; or as
doubtful, and then we withhold our assent, and suspend our judgment; 3.
or as true, and then we assent to it. But this assent, thirdly, is not to be
confounded with faith, because it is more general. For either we assent to a
proposition faintly, imagining that perhaps it may be otherwise, as in
contingent propositions, which so are true as that they may be false. And then
our judgment of them, and assent to them, is called opinion: or we assent
firmly, as being persuaded, that it cannot be otherwise, and this is called
knowledge Now, a man knows a proposition to be true, and is assured that it
cannot be otherwise, being persuaded thereunto, either by the evidence of the
thing or by the infallible authority of the propounder. Of the thing, being
either manifest in it self to sense and experience, or to reason, and then it
is called (...) or intelligentia, whereby without discourse men know things so
to be, which is noeticall or axioma^icall judgment of a proposition in it
self manifest: or else manifested by discourse, as of questions
syllogistically concluded, and this judgment or knowledge is called (...) which
is the science of conclusions, which we know cannot possibly be false, the
premises being true. But when a thing is neither manifest in it self to sense
or reason, nor manifested by discourse; and yet we do know and are undoubtedly
persuaded of the necessary and infallible truth thereof, moved the^unto by the
divine authority of the propounder, which is the Spirit of truth: that is
called faith, which is, as you heard out of Basil, (...) or (...) an undoubted
assent or full persuasion, or assurance eui falsum subesse non potest, the
subject whereof cannot be false. Where fourthly, you see indeed that faith is
distinguished against Science and evident intelligence, but as a special under
the same general, which is notitia knowledge. And therefore the mysteries of
says, which surpass our reason, though we do not understand them by that
knowledge, which is of propositions either manif^st in themselves, or
manifested by discourse: yet we know them to be undoubtedly true, because of
the authority of the propounder, knowing ^ Tim. 1. 12.
whom we do believe. And therefore fifthly, very absurd was he who said, that
faith may better be defined by ignorance, than by knowledge.

XV. Thus have we seen the salshood of the popish doctrine concerning
implicit faith: now let us show the wickedness of it; The wickedness of the
doctrine concerning implicit faith.
which consists in this, that it is an horrible couzenage of the people to
their perdition. Here therefore two things are to be showed: first, that it is
an egregious imposture and couzenage. Secondly, that it is extremely pernicious
to the people. Their cozenage stands in this: that when they say, that the
faith required iu a lay man, as sufficient to his justification, is to believe
or rather to profess himself to believe How the Papists understand the
Article of the Catholic Church.
whatsoever the Catholic Church believes, though in particular he know not
what the Church believes: their meaning is, that the church of Rome, and
therein the Pope is not only the whole materi^ll object, but also the formal
object of their faith. I say the whole material object. For they teach Gordon.
c^ntr. 1. cap. 27.
that whatsoever is to be believed is reduced to this one article of the
Creed, I believe the holy Catholic Church, and that this faith is a more (...)
faith, than if a man should say, I believe the whole Scriptures. For he that
believes the Catholic Church, beleev^th whatsoever the Catholic Church
propounds to be believed. Now their Church propounds to be believed, not
only tho whole written word, both Apocryphal and Canonical, but the
unwritten also, which are the traditions of the Church. They make the Church
also the formal object of says, not only which we believe; but also for
which w^ believe, whatsoever is to be believed, and so make the Church to be
the rule and the principium or principle of their faith. These are the grounds
of their imposture. But their cozenage especially consists in this* that
whatsoever excellency they ascribe to the Catholic Church, that they
attribute wholly and only to the Church of Rome, and therein to the Pope. For
th^s they expound that Article in their new Creed. Bulla Pij. 4. super forma
iuramenti professionis fi^ci.
I believe the holy, Catholic, Apostolical Church of Rome the Mother and
Mistress of all other Churches, out of which there is no salvation. So excluding
from salvation all those that have been, are, or shall be who live not in
communion with, and subjection to the Church and Pope of Rome. This is the
principal Not whereby the greatest number of silly souls are cony ^ch'd. How
the Apostle understood the Article.


. XVI. No doubt the Apostle by Catholic understood the Universal, and not any
particular Church, fuch as the Church of Rome, which was not then extant, when
the Creed was made, as themselves do ^each. And therefor the Apostles
themselves, when they made the Creed, were not of that Church. And by holy
Universal Church being an object of faith, and therefore not seen, they
understand the universal company of the Elect: which is the body of Christ,
containing not only the Militant Church, but also the Triumphant: and not
only the Church after the asc^ion of Christ, but also before from the
beginning of the world. And not only those who were or are under the Pope, but
also those who never acknowledged any subjection to the Sea of Rome: such as
were the Churches under the other four Patriar^es of Constantinople,
Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem; and such as are the greatest part of
Christ^ at this day. But if by Universal must be meant particular, and if by
Catholic must be understood Roman, then, by their doctrine, from the company
of them that are and shall be saved, are excluded; first, the Church
Triumphant; secondly, the Church which was from the beginning until the Church
of Rome was plan^d, thirdly the four (...) Churches, and others, which
acknowledged no subjection to the Sea of Rome, in which were many Holy Martyr^,
and the most of the godly and learned Fathers. In all which time the Bishop of
Rome was, at the most, but a Patriarch, as others were, until (...), that
barbarous Tyra^t, in the year of our Lord 607. made him Universal Bishop, and
Head of the Universal Church, the proper tit^ of Antichrist; fourthly, all
those Churches which since that time, and at this day acknowledg^ ^o subjection
to the Pope, as their Head, which is the greater and better part of
Christendom. Now what a (...) is this, to persuade men, that there is no
salvation for those, who do not acknowledge the Pope to be their head, that
is, who are not limbs and members of Antichrist^ especially when the
Scriptures teach, that Antichrist prevail^ in them 1 2 These. 2. 10. Mat. 24.
24. Apoc. 17. 8. D. Morton Bishop of Lichfield and Coven^y. The second part of
their cozenage.
only ^ that perish.

. XVII. But although this be a grand imposture, as a right reverend learned man
has showed, to teach men to believe that the Church of Rome alone is the
Catholic Church out of which no^e can be saved* yet this is but half of their
cozenage. For (...) article of the Church they expound as if it were not (...)
(...), I believe that there is a Church; as, when it is said, (...) (...)
(...), (...) (...) etc. I believe the comm^ion of Saints, there mission of
^nnes, etc. but as if it were said eredo Ecol^sia, o^ rather in Ecclesiam. I
believe the Church, or in the Church as that which cannot (...) and
consequently believe, whatso^er the Church teaches or propounds to be
believed: making the Church (...) formal object of their faith, and principal
rule or principle into which their faith is last resolved, for which they give
credit to the Scriptures themselves; which receive their credit and authority
from the Church. Now by this Church they mean not the universal company of
Catholics, for they are compared to Jobs Thom. 2. ^ ^. ^ 9. 2. 6. Minores, qui

Asses, but the Prelates of the Church of Rome, and among them the Pope, who
virtually is the Church, in whom alone the prerogative of not erring resideth.
For a general or Oecumenicall counsel, which is the whole Church
representative, they say without the Pope may err: but the Pope himself alone
without a council cannot err. And therefore the authority of a general
council and of the Pope together Turrecrem. sum. ^. 3. c. 41.
is no more than of the Pope alone. It is the Pope therefore alone that cannot
err, who has an heavenly and infallible judgment, who is the supreme Judge
in all controversies, the chief and only authentical interpreter of the
Scriptures, so that no point of religion is to be held for truth but what he
determines, no text of Scripture to be held the word of God, in any other
sense than he holds: yea, that a text of Scripture urged against them in
another sense, than he holds, is not the word of God, Hosius de express. Dei
verbo.
but rather of the devil. By which means the Pope is stepped into the room of
Christ and and is undoubtedly become Antichrist. So that the implicit faith of
the Papists, whereby they profess themselves to believe what is propounded by
the Church, meaning especially the Sea of Rome, that is to say the Pope, to be
believed; and consequently whereby they profess themselves to believe in the
Pope as the principal rule, principle and foundation of their faith, is the
very character and mark of the Beast, whereby men are branded to destruction.
The doctrine os implicit faith pernicious.


. XVIII. The which does also prove the other point, viz. how pernicious the
doctrine of implicit faith is, as tending to the perdition of the seduced
people, which I will also prove by other reasons. For under the name of
implicit faith they commend unto the Laity damnable ignorance; that, having
blindfolded them, they may lead them, as it were, by the nose, whither it
pleases them. To them it is sufficient to believe what the Church believes,
though they know little or nothing of the Churches belief. If one Rhemists in
Luke c. 12. 11.
of them be called before the Commissioners, he shall say enough and defend
himself sufficiently when he answers that he is a Catholic, and that he
will live and dye in that faith which the Catholic Church does teach, and that
this Church can give them a reason of all those things which they demand. And
thus according to Christ's promise, Luke 12. 12. the holy Ghost (for sooth)
teaches Ibid. in Marg.
every unlearned Catholic to give sufficient reason of his faith. But it is
evident, that those who live in ignorance, do live in a state of damnation,
or, as the Scripture speaks, Luke 1. 79.
do sit in darkness and in the shadow of death. First, because they live
without God, Ephesians. 2. 12. and 4. 18.
as it were Atheists in this world. For they that know not God, have not God.
Secondly, because they are void of all grace whereby they might hope to be
saved. For knowledge being the first of all graces, where that is wanting, all
the rest are absent. Again, without faith there is no saving grace, for faith
is the mother and root of all other graces; and without knowledge there is no
faith, as I have already showed. For how can t they believe in him of whom they
have b Romans 10. 14.
not heard, and by hearing known? Knowledge is, as it were, the first step
toward faith and all other graces; and therefore he that has not that in some
measure, has not made one step in the way that leads to eternal life.
Thirdly, because they are not Christ's sheep, nor Gods children. For I, says
our Savior, know mine, and I am known of mine, Ioh. 10. 14. They shall know
me every one of them says the Lord, from the greatest to the least of them,
Ier. 31. 34. All Gods children shall be taught of God, Esai. 54. 13. Ioh. 6.
45. every one therefore that has heard and learned of the Father comes to
me, says our Savior, and none else. All Gods children have the unction from
the holy One, and they know all needful things, 1 Ioh. 2. 20. 27. Ioh. 16. 13.
Fourthly, because it has all the respects of evil in it. For it is not one ly
a sin, but the cause of all sin and error, a punishment and the cause of
punishment, both in this life and in the world to come. A sin, rep^oved and
condemned, Ier. 4. 22. and. 9. 3. Hos. 4. 1. ^ Cor. 15. 34. For it, a sacrifice
was ordained, Levit. 4. 2. yea, all the sins, for which sacrifices were
offered, were (...), ^ that is ignorances, Heb. 9. 7. The cause of sin:
Errant Prove 14. 22. Mat. 22. 29.
qui operantur mulum. They err that sin, and none err but by ignorance as
Augustine says, Non erratur nisi per ignorantiam, whence sinners are called
(...), such as are ignorant and do err, Heb. 5. 3. Ignorance Council. Tolet.
4. c. 24. Conc. Arelat. 4. can. 3.
is the mother of all errors. Regnum ignorantiae, says Augustine, regnum
erroris. Ignorance also is a fearful punishment^ when God does punish men
with blindness of heart, Esai. 6. 9, 10. and sends upon them, (...), the
efficacy of error, 2 Th^s. 2. 11. It is also the cause of punishment (for the
people that understands not shall be punished, Hos. 4. 14.) as of captivity^
Esai.. 5. 13. of destruction, Hos. 4. 6. it makes men subject to the curse of
God, Psalm. 79. 6. Ier. 10. 25. and to eternal damnation, 2. These. 1. 8. If our
Gospel be hid, says the Apostle, it is hid to them that perish, 2 Cor. 4. 3.
For if it be eternal life Job. 17. 3.
to know God and Christ our Savior, then not to know God and our Savior is to
miss of eternal life. Qui ea qu^ sunt Domini nesciunt a Domino nesciuntur,
says Gregory, (...). l. 1. cap. 1. 1 Cor. 14. 38. vulg.

Rhemes Can 8.
denies that they can be saved, who do not understand the Creed and the
Lords Prayer. And again, (...) chard. dec^et. lib. 2. c. 62
no man can be saved without faith, and no man can believe that which he does
not know nor has heard. Augustine Ad Sextum (...) pisl. 105.

. XIX. All this notwithstanding, the popish Impostors detain the people in
ignorance, they have taken away the Key Luk 11. 52.
of knowledge, and shut up Mat. 23. 23.
the Kingdom of Heaven against their followers: for neither they go in
themselves, neither suffer them, that feign would enter, to go in. They forbid
them to read the Scriptures which are able to make them wise to salvation, 2 Timothy 3. 15. which our Savior therefore commands them to search, Ioh. 5. 39.
They suffer them not to hear them, nor yet the divine service, otherwise than
in an unknowen tongue, contrary to the rule of the Apostle 1 Cor. 14. and
wherefore all this? partly, that their errors and abominations should not be
seen; for he that evil does hates the light, and (as thieves by night) wish
the light of Gods Word to be put out, or at least to be hid under a Bushel:
and partly that they may be Lords over the peoples faith, and may make them
believe what they list, that they may rule them at their pleasure, that they
may lead them whither they please. For he that walks in darkness knows
Ioh. 12. 35.
not whither he goes, may as easily be led up and down, as Sampson Iud. 16.
21.
after his eyes were put out. But those that are of God do wish that the
people of God may increase in knowledge of God, 1 These. 1. 10. that they may be
perfect in understanding, 1 Cor. 14. 20. that they may abound more and more in
knowledge, Phil. 1. 9. (For not to be proficients in knowledge they esteem a
great fault. Heb. 5. 11, 12. 2 Timothy 3. 7.) that the Word of Christ may dwell in
them richly in all Wisdom, Col. 2. 2. and 3. 16. that they may be able and
ready to give an answer to every man that asks a reason of that hope that is
in them, 1 Pet. 3. 15. (for where men of all other professions can give a
reason of that which they do profess, it is a great absurdity, as Chrysostom
In Joan. (...).
testifies, for a man professing himself a Christian, not to be able to give
an account of his faith) that they may try all things and hold fast that which
is good, 1 These. 5. 21. that Husbands may be able to instruct their Wives, 1
Cor. 14. 35. 1 Pet. 3. 7.
and householders their families, Deuteronomy. 6. 7. and 11. 19. Yea Moses the Man of
God wished, that all the Lords people were Prophets, Number. 11. 29.

. XX. And as the godly have wished, so the Lord has promised In the true
Church plenty of Knowledge.
that in the Church of Christ there should be plenty of knowledge, Esa. 11. 9.
Ier. 31. 34. and that all the faithful should be taught of God, Esai. 54. 13.
And this was verified in times past in the primitive Churches, and is at this
day in all true Churches, and where it is not in some measure verified (as it
is not in the Church of Rome) that is not a true Church. Not to speak of the
present times, I will produce one Testimony of the ancient Churches. In which
it was usual to be seen Theodoret. Therapeut. sermon. 5. page 81.
that the points of Christian Religion were known not only to the Teachers of
the Church, but also to all manner of artificers and handicrafts (...).
men, of women likewise, not only such as were lettered, but those of the
meanest sort, even servants and handmaids: and not only Citizens but also
Country people, as Husbandmen and laborers had this knowledge, who might be
found conferring of the Divine Trinity, of the Creation of all things, and
having better knowledge of the nature of man, than Plato or Arist^tle.

Finally, the Papists by their doctrine of implicit faith, do bereave the
faithful of their chief rejoicing. For thus says the Lord: Ier. 9. 23. 24.
Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom, neither let the mighty man glory
in his might, let not the rich man glory in his riches: but let him that
glories glory in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the
Lord, which exercise loving kindness, judgment and righteousness in the
earth, for in these things I delight says the Lord. So much of the first
question.

CAP. II. Pr^ving that a true justifying faith cannot be severed from Charity
and other graces.
. I.

THE second question concerning the nature of faith is, whether a true
justifying faith may be severed from Charity and from all other graces of
Sanctification. The Papists hold the affirmative, we the negative.

The reasons of our assertion, that true justifying faith is ever accompanied
with Charity and other graces, and cannot indeed be severed from them, are
manifold and manifest.

My first reason is this: All that are regenerate and borne of God Our first
reason: because he that has true faith is regenerate.
have Charity, and other graces of sanctification.

All that truly believe in Christ, or, which is all one, that have a true
justifying faith are regenerate and borne of God.

Therefore all that truly believe in Christ, have charity and other graces of
sanctification.

The proposition is thus proved. Regeneration consists in the infusion of
graces of sanctification, and therefore they, who are regenerate, are endued
with those graces.

Seondly, regeneration is the renewing of a man according to the image of God
in true holiness and righteousness, Ephesians. 4. 24. both which are comprehended
in Charity. The former, being the love of God; the other, of our neighbor.

Thirdly, the Papists themselves do teach, that when men are regenerated in
baptism, there is with faith infused Charity.

Fourthly, as he that has Charity is borne of God and knows him: so he that
has not Charity knows not God, and much less is borne of him. 1 Ioh. 4. 8..

The assumption: All that have a true justifying faith are regenerate and borne
of God. For first, whosoever believes, that I ^ ^vs is the Christ, is bome of
God, 1 Ioh.. 5. 1. Secondly, as many as receive Christ (by faith) to them he
gave this, (...), this privilege or prerogatiye to be the sons of God, even
to them that believe on his name, who are borne not of blood nor of the will of
the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. Ioh. 1. 12. 13. Thirdly, All
that do truly believe are the children of God by faith in Christ Jesus. Gal.
3. 26. Fourthly, Faith is a grace of regeneration, which the holy Ghost does
ingenerate and infuse, when he does regenerate as the Papists themselves
confess. Neither is it of nature, or from our selves, but it is the special
gift of God, Ephesians 2, 8. for no man can truly say, that is, with a lively and
unfeigned assent of the heart, that Jesus is the Lord, but by the holy Ghost, 1
Cor. 12. 3. To believe, that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God,
flesh and blood has not revealed to any man, but God the Father, who is in
heaven, Matthew. 16. 16, 17. No man, says our Savior can come to me, that is,
believe in me, ( Ioh. 6. 35.) except the Father, who has sent me, draw him,
John 6. 44. and except it be given unto him by my Father, verse. 65. and how
given? as a proper fruit of election. For justifying faith is the faith of the
elect, 7 (...). 1. 1 given unto us when we are called, according to the purpose
of God and his grace given unto us in Christ before all secular times, 2 Timothy
1. 9. For those, whom God gives to Christ by election, they come unto him by
faith, Ioh. 6. 37. and so many as are ordained to eternal life, believe, Act.
13. 48.

. II. Secondly, Whosoever^have the Spirit of Christ, dwelling in them Our
second reason: because he has the Spirit of Christ.
are ^udued with Charity and other graces, which all are the fruits Gal. 5. 22.
of the Spirit. who is the Spirit of Heb. 10. 29.
grace; and contrariwise they who have not Charity, have not the Spirit of
Christ. For the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of love: God is love, and he
that abides in love dwells in God, and God in him, 1 Ioh 4. 16. but he that
loves not, knows not God and much less dwells in him, verse. 8.

All that have true faith have the Spirit Romans 8. 11. 1 Cor. 3. 16. 6. 19. 2 Timothy 1. 14.
of Christ dwelling in them, by which Christ dwells in them, and those which
have not the Spirit of Christ are none of his, Romans 8. 9 Faith is the proper
work of the Spirit who is therefore called the Spirit of faith, 2 Cor. 4. 13.
And therefore those, who are endued with true faith, 2 Cor. 13. 5. 1 Ioh. 3. 24.
Ephesians 3. ^7.
have the Spirit, by both which Christ dwells in us. Again, all that are the
sons of ^od have the Spirit of Christ, Gal. 4. 6. all that truly believe are
the sons Gal. 3 26. Ioh. 1. 12. 13. 1 Ioh. 3. 24. 4. 13.
of God; as has been showed. All that be Christ's they have his Spirit, for
those that have not his Spirit are none of his, Romans 8. 9. All that truly
believe are Christ's, 1 Cor. 3. 23. both because God has given them unto him,
John 6. 37. and 17. 9, 24. and because he has bought them with a great price,
1 Cor. 6. 19. and because by faith they are engrafted and united unto him as
his members.

Therefore all that have true faith, are endued with Charity and other graces.

. III. Thirdly, all that are sanctified are endued with Charity and Our third
reason, because he is sanctified.
other graces, for in them our sanctification does consist.

All that have true faith are sanctified. For first, by faith the heart is
purified, Acts 15. 9. and true faith works by love, Galathians 5. 6.

Secondly, because all that are justified are also sanctified. All that have a
true faith are justified, therefore all that have a true faith are sanctified.
The proposition can in no sort be denied by the Papists who confound
justification and sanctification. But though they must necessarily be
distinguished, yet they may not, they cannot be severed. They are such
unseparablecompanions, that whosoever has the one, has the other and
whosoever has not both, has neither: whosoever is in Christ (as all the
faithful are) is a new creature, 2 Cor. 5. 17. he lives not after the flesh
but after the Spirit, Romans 8. 1. He crucifie^h the flesh with the lusts
thereof, Gal. 5. 24. This truth is confirmed by the oath of God, whereby he has
promised in the covenant of grace, Luke 1. 73, 74, 75.
that to all the faithful the sons of Abraham he will give them redemption
and justification, and being redeemed he will give them grace to worship him
in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of their life. Those
therefore whom God does justify by faith, he does sanctify by his Spirit.

But all that have a true justifying faith are justified, and by their
justification have right, or are entitled to the Kingdom of heaven, Act. 13.
38, 39. yea the Gospel teaches, not only that they which truly believe
shall be saved, but also that they are translated from death to life, and that
they have eternal life. Ioh. 5. 24. and 6. 47. 1 Ioh. 5. 11. 13. Five other
reasons.


. IV. Fourthly, all true disciples of Christ are endued with charity. Ioh. 13.
35.

All that truly believe in Christ are his true disciples, therefore, etc.

Fifthly, that which works by Charity is not without it:

True faith works by Charity, Gal. 5. 6.

Sixthly, The formed faith is not severed from Charity as the Papists
themselves teach.

True justifying faith is the formed faith, for that which is without form is
neither atrue nor justifying, but a dead and counterfeit faith.

Seventhly, If faith without Charity do not justify, then a true justifying
faith is not without Charity. But the former is true, for that faith which is
without Charity profits nothing, 1 Cor. 13. 2. therefore the later.

Eighthly, out of 1 John 4. 8. he that believes knows God, they that love
not know not God, ergo, they that love not, believe not. Seven other Arguments
out of Iam. 2. 24, etc.


. V. To these eight arguments we will add seven more out of the Epistle of S.
James, Chapter 2. beginning at the 14. verse: where, he does not go about to
prove, that a true justifying faith does not justify alone, but that that
faith, which is alone without Charity, without good works, does neither
justify alone, nor at all. And that he proves by these reasons:

First, verse 14. True faith does justify and save a man, that faith which is
in profession only being void of Charity, or, as Saint James speaks, when a
man says he hat^ faith and has not works, does not justify or save a man,
and therefore is not a true faith.

Secondly, a pari, verse 15, 16, 17. Charity which is only in words and
profession, and not indeed and 1 Ioh. 3. 18.
truth, is unprofitable and vain: so pari ratione, faith which is only in
profession, being alone, void of Charity and of good works, is dead.

Thirdly, verse 18. True faith may be demonstrated by good works, but that
faith which is in profession only, and void of Charity cannot be demonstrated
by good works, therefore it is not a true faith.

Fourthly, ver. 19. that faith which is common to devils is no true justifying
faith, for they believe that which they abhor, whereupon Augustine In
epistolam Joan. tract. 10.
says, Fides* Christiani, cum dilectione est, daemonis autem sine dilectione.

Fifthly, verse. 20. the dead faith of a vain man is not a justifying faith:
that faith which is without charity is the dead faith of a vain man; therefore
not a justifying faith.

Sixthly, ver. 21. 22. 23. 24, 25. True justifying faith is such a faith as was
that of Abr^ham, or at least as was that of Rahab, that is, fruitful of good
works: but that which is without Charity and without good works is not such a
faith as that of Abraham or of Rahab.

Seventhly* verse. 26. ^ simili. as the body without spirit is dead, so that
faith which is without good works is dead. Upon these arguments of Saint James
it does inevitably follow, that seeing that faith which is severed from
Charity, and destitute of good works is not a true justifying faith, therefore
a true justifying faith is not severed from Charity, nor destitute of good
works.

. VI. These fifteen Arguments, are, as I suppose, without exception. Six
other arguments defended against Bellarmine. First, out of 1 Timothy 5. 8.
Those which Bellarmine thought he could best answer, he has propounded as
our best Arguments, and cavilled with them: they are in number six, the first
out of 1 Timothy 5. 8. That, for want whereof a man declares himself to be
without true faith, and to be worse than an infidel, cannot be separated from
a true faith.

For want of Charity, yea, for want of one branch thereof, which is to provide
for a man's own, especially, those of his own house, whom the very insidels
are wont to provide for, a man declares himself to be without true faith,
that is, in Saint Paul's phrase, has denied the faith and is worse than an
infidel in that particular: therefore Charity cannot be separated from true
faith.

To this Bellarmine frames an answer, against himself, that, as Chrysostom,
and other interpreters do witness, the Apostle speaks of such, who are said
to deny the faith, because they do not live, as faith does teach men to live,
(as none do, who have not Charity, and therefore those who have not Charity,
have not faith) who, as the same Apostle says, Tit. 1, 16.
profess themselves to know God, but in deeds deny him: which also is against
himself: for how, says Chrysostom, can such a man be said to believe, that
denies God? Therefore, says he, the wicked deny the faith not in heart or
mouth, but indeed; and of them, says he, writes Saint Gregory, whose
testimony he alleges directly against himself, Homil. 29. in Evang.
Eos non veraciter credere, and non habere veram fidem, quinon been operantur:
that they do not truly believe, nor have a true faith, who do not work
well. And therefore those that work ill, as those do who are without Charity,
and namely those who provide not for their domestics, show that they have no
true faith. But this he salveth with another testimony of the same Gregory
Homil. 38.
that many enter into the Church, because they have faith; and yet want the
wedding garment, because they have not Charity. Where, by faith we are to
understand the profession of faith; which many make who have not Charity. But
by the wedding garment, we are, according to the Scriptures, to understand
rather Christ and his righteousness, as I have showed heretofore, put on by a
true and lively faith: for he that was without the wedding garment, wanted
faith, as well as charity. The Author of the unfinished Work in Chrysostom
faith I^ Matthew. 22 hom. 41.
Nuptiale vestimentum est fides vera, quae est per Iesum Christum and justitiam
ejus: the wedding garment is the true faith, which is by Jesus Christ, and his
righteousness. But will you hear one of their own Writers, upon Matthew. 22.
what is, says he, 1. Ferus in Matib. 22.
that wedding garment* to wit, that whereof Paul speaks, when he says, Romans
13. 14. Gal. 3. 27.
put on the Lord Jesus Christ. This garment is inwardly, put on by faith, when
thou put on Cum tuis peccat is sup^r in duis C^risti i^stitiam, tu is
demerit is ipsius merita, tuae in obedientia ipsius obedientiam. The second out
of John. 6. 64.
Christ's righteousness to cover thy sins, etc.

. VII. The second out of Ioh. 6. 64. Judas, though he professed the faith, is
yet said not to have believed, because he wanted Charity, and therefore they
who want Charity want faith. Bellarmine answers, that he is said not to
believe, because at that time he had lost his faith. I reply: Judas, though he
professed the faith, yet he never had true faith, and therefore never lost it.
For from the beginning Jesus knew who they were that believed not, and who
should betray him: for this cause says he in the next verse, Verse. 6^.
I said unto you that no man can come to me (that is believe in me, verse. 35.
and 64.) unless it be given unto him of my Father which he insinuates had
not been given to Judas, whom from the beginning he knew to be no believer.

. VIII. He that says he knows God, namely by faith, and The ^hird out of 1
John 2. 4.
keeps not his commandments, is a liar. Bellarmine answers, that he
speaks of the knowledge of familiarity, and friendship: of which the Lord
speaks to the wicked, Matthew. 7. 25. I know you not. whereunto I reply, that
if he speak of such knowledge it is the knowledge of faith, and cannot be had
but by faith, and so the argument stands in force. Howbeit, unfitly does he
allege the Lords not knowing of the wicked, to prove the meaning of our
knowing of him. If he speak not of the knowledge of faith, the argument is the
stronger, for if he be a liar, that only says that he knows God and keeps
not his commandments, then much more is he a liar, that says he knows God
by faith, and keeps not his commandments. Beda indeed expounds this
knowledge of God of the love of God, which is a fruit and consequent of our
faith, hocest Deum nosse quod amare: but others, of faith, as In Ezekiel. hom. 22.
Gregory speaking of this place, notitia quipp^ Dei ad fide^ pertinet.
Oecumenius makes this verse to be of the same signification with the sixth
verse of the first Chapter. If we say, that we have fellowship with him, and
walk in darkness, we are liars: and that which Saint John there calls
(...) Communion, here he calls (...) or (...) commixtion or conjunction.
Thus therefore he says; Saint John having said before that those which (...).
believe in the Lord have communion or fellowship with him: here he sets
down evidences of our communion with him. In this we know, that we know him
(...) for that which he had said before, C. 1. v. 6.
that we have conjunction or communion with him, if we keep his
Commandments. And this, says he, he more fully shows by the contrary: but
he that says, I know him, (...) or I have communion with him, and keeps not
his Commandments, he is a liar. This then is ^is meaning, he that says I know
God, that is, I have Communion with him by faith, and does not keep his
Commandments, he is a liar. But whether we understand the words of communion
by faith, or of faith, according to the usual p^rase of the Scriptures putting
knowledge for faith, as I noted before, Cap. 1. S. 4.
or of knowledge it self, the argument is unanswerable. For if we cannot
truly be said to know Christ, that is, to believe in him, unless we keep
his Commandments, then it is evident, that true faith cannot be severed from
Charity. For this is love, if we keep his Commandments, 1 Ioh. 5. 3. again,
if he that says he knows God and keeps not his Commandemenes be a liar,
much more he that says he believes in God and keeps not his Commandments
is a liar, as I said before. To this add Tit. 1. ^6. which Bellarmine cited
against himself, those that profess themselves to know God, but in works
deny him, they are (...) unbeleevers, Ioh. 3. 36. or as the vulgar Latin
incredibiles, or, as Thomas Aquinas, non apti ad credendum.

. IX. Fourthly, 1 Ioh. 5. 1. Every one that b^leeveth that Jesus is The fourth
out of 1 John 5. 1.
the Christ, is borne of God, and therefore undoubtedly has charity.
Bellarmine answers that he speaks, de fide formata, as Saint Augustine
Tract. 10. in epist. Joan.
expounds, and so do we, for whosoever truly believes has fidem
formatam. For the Apostle no doubt speaks of a true lively says, and such
there is none, but that which the Papists call formatam, which works by love.
And therefore the argument holds: that whosoever has a true lively
justifying faith is borne of God, or regenerated by the Spirit of
sanctification, and therefore is undoubtedly endued with charity.

. Fifthly, Iam. 2. That faith which i^ without works is dead: The fifth out of
Jam. 2. 17. 20.
A true lively justifying faith is not dead; Therefore ^ true liv^ly ^ustifying
faith is not without works. Bellarmine says, he has explaned this in his
third argument, Respons ad object. 4.
that faith is said to be dead, not as a m^ is said to be dead, who after
death is not: but as a body is said to be dead, which after death is, but
lives not. For, says he, Life is not of the essence of faith, as it (...) of
the essence of a man: but by a metaphor, says is said to live, when it
works, and to be dead, when it works not. Even as water is said to be
living, which continually flows; as in Fo^ntaines and Rivers; d^d, which
moves not, as in standing pooles, and yet both is truly and properly water.
Whereunto I reply, that the body of a man being dead is a true body in respect
of the general nature of a body, both because it consists of three
dimensions, as all true bodies do, and because it consists of all the
Elements, as all perfectly compounded bodies do. But whereas bodies perfectly
compounded are subdivided, in corpor a in animata and animata: the dead body of
a man, or of a beast, or of a plant, is not a true body in genere ani^, no more
than the several parts thereof, as the eye, the care, etc. because it is
deprived of his form, which is the anima thereof according to his kind. So
faith which is dead, may in respect of the general nature of faith be called
a true faith, because it is an assent to the truth revealed by God: yet whereas
assent is either forced, or voluntary, and that either to the Law, which is the
legal, ^or to the Gospel which is the Evangelicall faith, and this, either
unfeigned, lively, and effectual, or counterfeit, idle, and uneffectuall:
therefore the dead faith being either not voluntary, such as is in the Devils
and some wicked men, who believe that which they abhor; or not Evangelicall,
as in the Jews, or not unfeigned, lively, and effectual as in hypocrites and
unsound Christians, is not a true justifying faith, because it wants the
form and as it were the anima of a true justifying faith, which is the inward
integrity: for that is actus primus the inward (...) or efficacy thereof,
whereby it does effectually receive, that is, apprehend and apply Christ to the
believer.

It is true, that by a metaphor taken from men faith is said to be either alive
or dead: though herein is a dissimilitude; because a man is said to be dead,
who before had lived, bu^faith is only said to be dead not because it ever had
lived, but because it is without life, as many things also are by a metaphore
said to be dead, blind, or dumb, which never did live, see, or speak. But
says he, faith is said to be alive, when it works: and dead, when it works
not. I ^ad rather say it is alive when it is operative and energetical, though
it do not always actually work, as in sleep: and dead, when it is idle,
uneffectuall and unprofitable. But this is nothing to our argument: for if
faith without charity, or without works be said to be dead, then a true
lively justifying faith, cannot be without charity or good works; and that
which is is not a true justifying faith no more than a dead man is a man: and
yet as a dead ^n, which is but a carcass, is called by the name of that man
whose carcass it is even so dead faith, which is but a carcass, or rather a
counterfeit of faith, is called faith, not properly and truly, but (...).

. XI. That faith by which a righteous man shall live is not without The sixth
out of H^. 2. 4.
Charity:

By a true justifying faith a righteous man shall live.

Therefore a true justifying faith is not without charity.

To the assumption Bell^mine answers two ways. First, that a righteo^s man
is said to live by faith, because by faith, which is the substance of things
hoped for, he patiently supporteth himself in expectation of eternal life. To
which I reply, that the words are, the just shall live, and that the Apostle
more than once alleges that testimony in the question of justification, as
Romans 1. 17. Gal. 3. 11. to prove, that by faith a man is justified, that is
entitled to eternal life. Secondly, he answers, that the Prophet speaks
of fides formata per charitatem such as is in the just, who by such a faith, as
works by love, do live a spiritual life: which answer makes wholly for
us. For if the true faith, whereby the just man shall live, is formed by
charity, as the Papists speak, and works by charity as Saint Paul says:
then it follows, that the true justifying faith is never severed from Charity.

but of Devils, Again, to believe in Christ, it is not this to have the faith
of Devils which worthily is esteemed to be dead, but to have that faith which
works by love. And so he and some others expound that phrase of believing in
Christ. 3. Ille e^im credit in Christ^m, 3. Aug. in Joan. tract 9. Sent. lib.

Gregory In evangel. hom. 29.
as we heard before, denies them truly to believe or to have a true faith,
who do not live well. For that is true faith, says Ibid.
^e, which that which it says in words, it does not gainesay in manners, Hence
it is, that Paul speaks of certain falsis fidelib^s falsely called faithful
men, who confess Tit. 1. 16.
that they know God, but in deeds deny him. Hence, John says, he that says
he knows God, and does not, etc. the which, seeing it is so, we ought to
acknowledge the truth of our faith in consideration of our life. For then are
we truly faithful, if what we promise in words, we perform in deeds -- if
a man after Baptism keep that which he promised before baptism, let him now,
being certain that he is faithful, r^joyce: where observe, that those are
faithful (not that are baptized, but that keep their vow of Baptism, and that

which works by love.

CHAP. III. Bellarmines proofs, that true faith may be severed from Charity,
first, from the Scriptures, and then from Fathers.
. I.

NOw let us examine Bellarmines proofs. And first His first proof out of Ioh.
12. 42, 43.
out of the Scriptures. 1. Ioh. 12. 42, 43. Many of the princes or rulers
believed in Christ, but they did not confess^: for they loved the glory of men
more than the glory of God. Her^, says ^ee, the Evangelist testifies, that in
these Princes, there was Faith without Charity. His reason is thus to be framed.

The Princes, which did not confess Christ, were void of Charity:

The same Princes believe in Christ.

Therefore some that believe in Christ are void of Charity.

The proposition is proved, because they loved the glory or praise of men more
than of God. Answ. If they did absolutely and altogether prefer the glory of
men before the glory of God, then h^d they neither love of God, nor faith in
Christ, see Ioh. 5. 42, 44. But if by force of temptation or by humane frailty,
as fe^refulnesse, Ioh. 19. 38.
and too much love of the World, which are corruptions incident to the best,
they were for a time hindered from professing Christ; I dare not say, they were
void of Charity. For Saint Peter, when he both loved Christ and believed in
him, did deny him; which was worse than not confessing him. And it may be, that
among those rulers were reckoned, Nicodemus, and Joseph of Arimath^a; who,
though they had not for ^ time openly professed Christ: yet when there was
greatest cause of fear and of doubt, and least encouragement to profess him,
they express^ their love toward him, Ioh. 19. 31, 39. To the assumption, I
a^swere, those princes, who being void of Charity, loved the glory of men more
than the glory of God, by the testimony of Christ, neither did, nor could
believe, Ioh. 5. 42, 44. Neither did all they truly believe in Christ, who in
the Scriptures are said after a sort to have believed in him, For Ioh. 2. 23.
many are said to have bel^ved in his name, to whom our Savior would not, (...)
concredit himself, because he knew what was in them, verse. 24. 25.

. II. His second proof is out of 1 Cor. 13. 2. If I had all faith, so His
second proof out of 1 Cor. 13. 2.
that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing. therefore
faith may be severed from Charity. Answ. This place is either generally
understood of all faith, or particularly of the whole faith of working
miracles, but in neither sense does it favor the popish sancie. If generally,
then the Apostle must be understood, as speaking (...), by way of supposition,
and not as positively affirming, that either he, or any other having all faith
wanted Charity; therefore this supposition ( qu^ nihil ponit) proves nothing.
Yea, in suppositions and fained comparisons a man may suppose things incredible
and impossible; and much more improbable, (as in this place it self, if I
should speak with the tongues of men and Angels and have not love, if I had
all faith so that I could remove mountains, and have not love, and though I
bestow all my goods as it were by (...),
morsels to free the poor, and though I gave my body to be burnt and have not
Charity) and yet those suppositions, whether improbable or incredible, are of
no less force in arguing, than if they were absolutely true. Indeed if the
adversary could from this hypotheticall proposition truly assume the antecedent
(as he cannot) then might he urge this place to some purpose: but if it may
more truly be denied, or taken away, (as for example, if I or any other had
all faith, and yet had not love, as never man yet had) then is this allegation
to no purpose. To this Bellarmine replyeth, that the Apostle does not argue
from a condition impossible, but us^th an hyperbolt; when notwithstanding it is
most evident, that the Apostle speaks not in a simple hyperbolicall speech,
as Bellarmine makes him, but (...) if I had, which I have not, but this
supposall or fiction of a condition incredible does no less prove the
necessity of Charity, than if it were absolutely true.

If the place be understood particularly of the faith of miracles, the particle
all being not universal but integrall, as if it had been said, the whole
faith including all the degrees of it (which is very probable, not only in
respect of the authority of the Fathers heretofore mentioned, but also by the
words themselves: first, because he says (...), as speaking of a particular;
secondly, because he does instance in a high degree of that particular, so
that I could remove mountains,) then this alegation is impertinent. For the
question is not of the faith of miracles, whether it may be severed from
Charity, which we confess: but of the true justifying faith: which not all
they have, who have the faith of miracles. For that has been bestowed upon
Judas and other reprobates, Matthew. 10. 1. and 7. 22, 23. which plainly
overthrows Bellarmines conceit, that the faith of miracles is the same with
j^stifying faith but excelling, which is false in two respects: for first, it
would then follow, that all they who have had this faith, should have been
endued with justifying faith, and that all, who have excelled in the greatest
measure and degree of justifying faith, should have been adorned with the
faith of miracles. Both which are untrue. Secondly, the School men when they
distinguish grace into gratia gr^tum (...), (which is the justifying and
sanctifying grace tending to the good and Salvation of the party who has it)
and gratia gratis data tending to the good of others, the faith of working
miracles is reckoned in the later rank, 1 Corinthians. 12. 8, 9, 10.

. III. Yea, but it is promised, Mark. 16. 17. that signs should follow
Bellarmi^s instances.
them that believe, namely by a justifying faith whereof is mention, verse. 16.
But not, say I, that all believers should be workers of miracles, but some for
all. From whence nothing can be proved, but that to some, which did believe,
the gift of working miracles should be granted for the confirmation of the
faith.

Yea, but by says in for^r times the faithful stopped the mouths of Lions,
quenched the violence of fire, Heb. 11. 33. 34. Answ. These examples recorded
in the Scriptures were not wrought by the faithful themselves: but the Lord
because they ^id believe and trust in him, sent his Angel to stop the mouths
of Lions, Dan. 6. 22. 23. and to quench the violence of fire, Dan. 3. 17. 25.
Howbeit if themselves had wrought these miracles, it would prove no more, but
that some who had justifying faith, had also the faith of working miracles.

Neither does our Savior, Luke 17. say, that if a man had the justifying faith
like a grain of mustard seed, he should be able to remoove mountains: for
those who have had a great and a strong faith as namely Abraham, have had no
such power. Yea, but he speaks of that faith which the disciples pr^ied him
to increase, Luke 17. 5. But, say I, if you compare the place with his
parallel, Matthew. 17. 20. it will appear that both our Savior and his Apostle
speak of the faith of miracles. For when our Savior reproved them for their
want of faith, in that they were not able to cure the Lunaticke, who
notwithstanding were endued with justifying faith, as many others are, who
though they have a strong faith, yet are not able to work such a cu^e: they
desire our Savior to increase, or, as the word is (...).
add unto them faith: Whereupon our Savior returns this answer, if you
had faith as a grain of mustard seed, etc. does he mean justifying faith?
God forbid! for then no man living could be said to have so much of justifying
faith, as is a grain of mustard seed.

. IV. And whereas in the last place he would prove by the conjunction two
other instances.
of these three, Faith, Hope, and Charity, verse 13. that he speaks of the
same faith whereof he had spoken, verse 2. I answer, first, that it follows
not: for here the Apostle makes a new comparison of of Charity with Faith and
Hope, preferring it before them as greater, both in respect of the breadth or
(...); for whereas the benefit of Faith and Hope respects habentem, him that
has them, Charity is extended to others: and also in respect of the length, or
continuance. For whereas Faith and Hope do cease in the life to come, faith
being swallowed up in vision, and hope in fruition: love nevertheless is
continued with increase.

Secondly, this place makes rather against him. Now says the Apostle, that
is, during this life, these three abide, none of them failing altogether in
this life, and therefore they always go together; insomuch that whosoever
has any one of them, has al^o the other two. No man can have love or hope,
unless he have faith: and no man has true says, but he has both love and
hope; and according to the measure of his faith, such is the measure both of
his love and of his hope. For as that of Sup. Ezekiel. bom. 22.
Gregory is most true, quantum credimus, ^antum amamus; so it is no less true,
quantum credimus, tantum speramus. As for his allegation out of Augustine, De
Trinit. l. 5 ^. 18.
affirming that faith may be without charity: I deny not but that the faith of
hypocrites, which bears the name of faith, as a carcass or counterfeit do of
the man whose they are, is without charity but profits not. But that
justifying faith may be without charity, he says not: for how can it be a
justifying faith and not profit?

. V. His third testimony is Ia^. 2. 14. etc. Where, says he, Saint His third
testimony Iam. 2. 14.
James not only teaches, but also proves, that faith without works does not
justific, and that it may be without works.

We answer, that he does not speak of a true justifying faith, but of faith
professed only, or of the profession of faith, which I proved before Cap. 2,
^. 5*
And this appears verse. 14. where the question, disputed in that discourse,
is propounded. What does it profit, my brethren, if a man shall say, that he
has faith, or professes himself to believe, and has not works, can (...)
that faith of his, which is in profession only and without works, save him,
or justify him? No, by no means, for this affirmative interrogation is a most
emphaticall negation. This place therefore prooveth the contrary, viz. that
faith which is without works is not a true justifying faith, and therefore a
true justifying faith cannot be without works.

But that Saint James speaks of a true faith, Bellarmine endeavors to prove
by five reasons against the maine drift of the Apostle in that place, which, as
I showed before, was to prove, that such a faith, as is without works, is not
a true justifying faith. His first reason is, because Saint James calls it
absolutely faith, which name in the Scriptures alw^yes signifies the true
faith, that is, (or else he speaks to no purpose) the true justifying faith.
First, I answer, that Saint James verse 14. does not absolutely call it faith:
for he does not say, if a man have faith, meaning a true faith; but if a man
shall say, that he has faith, can that faith which is in profession only,
save him? And so in the verses following, the faith which he impleadeth, does
not signify the habi^ of true faith, but the bare profession of faith. But
does this word faith always in the Scriptures fignifie the true justifying
faith? Nothing less: for many times in the New Testament, and almost always
in the Old, faith is taken for fidel^ty, or faithfulness, as Tit. 2. 10.
sometimes for the doctrine of faith, which is believed, which the Papists
themselves call the Catholic faith. As Act. 6. 5. they obeyed the faith, Act.
14. 27, the door of faith, Romans 12. 6. the analogy of faith, etc. sometimes
the profession of faith, as Act. 14. 22. Romans 1. 8. and so as hereafter I am to
show, Iam. 2. 14. 24. And in this sense many are said to believe, that is, to
have faith, and are called fideles, that is believers, who only profess the
faith, and are in their own profession, or opinion of others, believers. So
Ioh. 2. 23. and 8. 30, 31. 33. Act. 8. 13. 21. and in this sense all that
profess the name of Christ, are called after his name Christians, and are
termed Fideles the faithful; not that all who are so called have the true
justifying faith, which is not of all, 2 These. 3, 2.
nor yet of all that are called, but only of the Tit. ^. 1.
elect. For among those, who are called the Faithful, there are many falsi
fideles, who are so falsely called, as we heard before out of In evang. hom. 29.
Gregory: sometimes, for the faith of miracles, (...). Chrysostom. Theoph. Oecum.
Theod. in 1 Cor. 12. 9. Gennad. apud Oecum. in 1 Cor. 13. 2.
as 1 Cor. 12. 9. and 13. 2. Mat. 17. 20. Mar. 11. 22, 23. Luke 17. 5, 6.

Secondly, he says, that Saint James in the same chapter, speaking of the
some faith, says that Abraham's faith wrought with his works, Ans. this is
also contrary to the drift of Saint James, who by this argument proves the
faith, which is without works to be no true justifying faith: because it is
not the faith of Abraham, nor yet of Raba^.

Thirdly, Saint James there concludes: ye see then that a man is justified by
works and not by faith only, but a (...) faith, which Calvin calls umbram
fidei, justifies neither alone nor at all. Ans. As I said before out of ver.
14. by faith we are here to understand faith professed, or the profession of
faith. And to be justified is here understood declarative. Now to declare a man
before men to be justified before God, two things are required, the profession
of the faith, and a Christian life answerable to his profession: and thus faith
professed cooperateth with works to declare a man to be justified. For
neither works alone without the profession of the faith will do it, for works
without faith are dead, Chrysoft. de fide and lege.
nor the profession of the faith without works; for such a profession is also
dead; but both must go together.

Fourthly, says he, this is proved by two comparisons, which he calls
examples. The former verse. 15. 16. which he does very sorrily express: first,
says he, he compares a man having faith without works, to him, who seeing
the poor wanting food and raiment, is content with that knowledge, and gives
them no alms. For even as it profits nothing the poor that the rich know
their want, although it be a most true knowledge, unless, according to that
knowledge, they bestow upon them necessaries: so true faith (...) nothing,
unless a man do study and endeavor to live according to it. Frigide admodum
and dilute. For where does Saint James compare true faith to these rich men's
idle knowledge? But the comparison plainly stands thus. As the profession of
charity in giving good words to the poor that want food and raiment (depart in
peace, be ye warmed and filled) is vain and unprofitable, if men do not
accordingly give them somewhat to supply their necessities: so the profession
of faith without works is dead. As therefore that charity which is in word and
not in deed, as Saint John speaks, 1 Io^. 3. 18.
is counterfeit, so that faith, which is in profession only severed from good
works is counterfeit and dead. Secondly, says he, Saint James compares faith
without works to a body without Spirit, which certainly is a true body, though
it be dead. Answ. this also is contrary to the intendment of Saint James who
therefore p^oveth, that faith which is without works, to be no true justifying
faith, because it is dead. For the profession of faith without works is like
to a man's body that is without Spirit: yea but says Bellarmine a dead body is
a true body, and a dead faith is a true faith. I answer as before. A dead
carcass though it be a true body in respect of his three dimensions, and of
his composition of the Elements, yet it is not the true original body of a man
(for a man is a living creature) no more than a dead branch or bough is a true
member of a living Tree. His fourth proof, because in the Church there are
both good and bad.


. VI. His fourth argument is taken from those testimonies which teach that in
the Church there are both good and bad; in the floor, both Wheat and chafe;
in the net, fishes both good and bad; in the flock, sheep and goats, etc. His
reason stands thus,

Some in the Church are wicked and void of Charity and other graces:

But all in the Church have faith:

Therefore some that have faith are void of Charity.

Answ. The assumption is most false, for not all that profess faith who from
thence are called fideles in opposition to Infidels, are endued with true
justifying faith, which is not of all, 2 Th^s. 3. 2. Tit. 1. 1.
but of the Elect, neither be all of the Church that be in it. 1 Ioh. 2. 19.
Non existimo quenquam ita desipere, says Augustine, Contr. Crescon. l. 1. c.
29.
ut credat ad Eccesiae pertinere unitatem eum, qui non habet charitatem.

But, says Bellarmine, if the wicked who are in the Church did want trut
faith, then should they chiefly be reprehended for their unbeleefe, but they
are reprehended non de amissione fidei sed de omissione operum, not for the
amission or loss of faith, but for the omission of good works. Ans. when
their want of faith does appear, Mat. 17. 17.
they are reprehended for it. But because that is many times hidden, and we are
in the judgment of Charity, to judge them faithful who profess the faith,
until the contrary appear: therefore hypocrites escape reprehension which open
sinners do incur. Bellarm. conclusion, that true justifying faith may in the
same party concur with sin and that it may be found in sinners; none deny, but
pharisaicall Papists, who hold themselves, being after their fashion as namely
by Baptism, or absolution justified, to be no sinners; professing that there
is no sin in them, nor any thing that God can hate. And whereas Bellarmine
takes it for granted, that all in the Church have faith, and that none want
it, but such as have lost it, as it is lost, they say, by every act of
infidelity: hereby is discovered the most pernicious doctrine of the Church of
Rome, whereby innumerable souls are nuzzled in ignorance, infidelity and
impenitencio to their utter ruin and perdition. For they teach, that all that
are baptized are ex opere operato justified by infusion of Faith Hope and
Charity; in which estate they remain, until they commit some mortal sin,
then indeed they lose their charity and their justification, but they retain
their faith, which was infused in Baptism, and still are to be accounted
faithful men and women; though they know nothing, nor actually believe any
thing; unless to their Baptism be added popish education, by which, for the
most part, they are taught to believe as their Church believes, that being the
safest course: which faith disposes them to justification, directing them
after the loss of their charity, wherein their justification consisted, to
seek to the Sacrament of penance, that thereby they may recover their
justification. Once a year therefore they go to their priest, to him they
formally confess their grosser sins; formally they profess themselves sorry
for them: the priest absolveth them from eternal punishment, enjoining them
some petite penance, whereby they are to satisfy for the temporal penalty,
which remains after their absolution from the eternal: by the priests
absolution they all stand actually justified, the priest refusing none, though
in truth they neither have knowledge, nor faith, nor Repentance, or amendment
of life, nor any other Grace, without which, for all their sacramental
justifications (and other they have none) they live and die in a most woeful
state of damnation.

. VII. His fifth argument is taken from the proper nature of faith and His
fifth proof from the nature of faith and charity.
charity: for says he, if faith and charity cannot be disjoined, either it
is, because one is of the nature of the other, or else because one necessarily
arises or springs from the other: but neither of these may be said; therefore
faith and charity may be severed. Ans. First, I deny the disjunctive
proposition, because a third thing may be added; and that is this, or because
the spirit of grace or regeneration, who is the author and efficient of both,
has unseparably united them in one and the same subject, wherein, working the
one, that is faith; with it, and by it he works the other. As touching the
Assumption, the former part, that the one is not of the nature of the other, it
is denied by the Roman-Catholike: the latter; that the one does not necessarily
spring from the other, by the true Catholics. For the Papists hold, that
charity is the form of justifying faith, without which it neither does, nor
can justify. And therefore they, of all men, ought to hold, that justifying
faith cannot be severed from charity. For whereas Bellarmine says, that
charity is but the outward form of faith, by which it works; I acknowledge
no outward form, but of artificial bodies. As for that which is principium
motus, by which any thing works, it is the very (...), the actus primus, the
proper form, whereby any thing as it is that which it is; so it works and
produces his proper and natural effects. And such is the unseparable
coexistence of the form and the thing formed, that posita forma, res ipsa
ponatur; sublata forma, res ipsa (...). The Papists therefore hold things
repugnant and (...), when they teach, that charity is the form of justifying
faith, and yet that justifying faith may be severed from it. The second, that
the one does not necessarily spring from the other, we deny. For true faith
does necessarily and infallibly incline the believer to love God and his
neighbor for Gods sake. For that faith, whereby we are persuaded of Gods love
to us in Christ, cannot but move and incline us to love God: neither can we
love God as good, if we do not first believe, that he is good. And such as is
the measure of our faith concerning Gods goodness to us, such is the measure
of our love to him. Bellarmine consesseth that says enclineth and disposes a
man to love; but says, a disposition and inclination non cogit, does not
compel a man, but leaves him free. As though there were no necessity, but of
coaction or constraint.

. VIII. That charity does necessarily follow faith, as an unseparable Whether
Charity does necessarily follow faith.
companion, he says, we have no sound proofs; and therefore are feign to
illustrate it by certain similitudes, which he calls examples. Answ. Whether
we have any sound proofs or not, I refer the Christian reader to the
fifteen arguments which Bellarmine took no notice of, besides those six I
vindicated from his cavils. As for similitudes, they were not brought to prove
the point, but to illustrate, and to make it more plain. As if I should
compare a regenerate soul to fire as Christ did John Baptist Ioh. 5. 35.
Luthers similitude.
to a burning and shining lamp; I might say (which was Luthers Prafat. in Ep.
ad Romans
similitude) as in fire, or rather if you please, in the Sunnebeames two things
concur, light and heat, and neither is without the other; the beams of the
Sun always by their light producing heat: so in the regenerate soul, there
are faith, as the light, and charity as the heat, and neither is without
other; because the spirit of regeneration as it were the Sun, by shedding
abroad the beams of Gods love into our hearts, that is, by working in us
faith, by which we are persuaded of Gods love toward us in Christ, inflameth
our hearts with the love of God; the beams of Gods love reflecting from our
souls some warmth of love toward God. To this Bellarmin^ answers, that
charity in the Scriptures is compared to fire, etc. Answ. So it may in respect
of the heat, as faith also may in respect of the light: as therefore in the
fire concurreth both light and heat, which cannot be severed, so in the
regenerate soul faith and love. Bucers similitude was of a sick man, Bucers
similitude.
who being desperately sick, if a Physician shall assure him of health, and
much more if he shall cure him by forgoing something that is most dear unto
him, cannot, if he believe so much, but affect and love him: so we being
desperately sick of sin and near to death and damnation, if the Lord shall
by giving his own Son, not only redeem us from death, but also entitle us
to the kingdom of Heaven: we cannot if we be truly persuaded hereof by
faith, but love God again, who has so loved us. For we love God 1 Ioh. 4. 19.
because he first loved us. To this Bellarmine answers, that he which
believes is inclined to love him in whom he believes, but is not forced
thereunto, which no man averreth.

. IX. A third similitude he would seem to produce out of Calvin's Institutions,
Lib. 3. c. 2.. 8.
(...) (...) Christ and his spirit cannot be separated, so faith Calvin's
similitude.
and charity cannot be severed: but though both the parts of this comparison
are true, yet there is no such similitude propounded by Calvin. But in that
place he proves, that true faith cannot be severed from a godly affection,
because true faith embraces Christ, as he is offered unto us of his Father:
now of his Father he is made unto us, not only righteousness, to be
received by faith unto justification 1 Cor. 1. 30.
; but holiness also to be applied by his spirit unto sanctification. And
therefore those that receive Christ receive also his spirit. Bellarmine
answers, that it is true indeed, that he which receives Christ receives him
with his spirit, sed credendo recipit, i. credit illum habere spiritum
sanctificationis, but he receives by believing, that is, he believes, that
Christ has aspirit of sanctification; but from hence it does not follow, that
the spirit of sanctification is always with faith in a man, unless it be
objectively, even as health is in a sick man (that has it not) when he
thinks of it, and desires it. Thus, in popish divinity, to receive the
spirit of Christ, is to believe, that Christ has a spirit of sanctification;
but not to be partaker thereof, or to have the communion of the holy Ghost;
which notwithstanding all those have, who truly believe in Christ. For all
that truly believe are the sons Gal. 3. 26. Ioh. 1. 12. 1 Ioh. 5. 1.
of God, as I have showed, and to so many as be his sons God does send the
Gal. 4. 6. Romans 8. 11.
spirit of his son into their hearts; his spirit dwells in them, and he by
his spirit. And if any man have not the spirit of Christ, Romans 8. 9.
he is none of his. If therefore all that receive Christ, receive also his
spirit, then all that truly believe, are also endued with charity, as I have
proved before Cap. 2.. 2.
.

. X. His sixth argument is taken from an absurdity which, he says, follows
upon our doctrine. For, says he, they do therefore contend, that a man is
justified by faith only, because if justification depended upon the condition
of works or our obedience of the Law, no man could be certain of his
justification: (to which effect the Apostle argues, Romans 4. 16.) And because
they believe, that justification consists in this certainty, therefore it
wo^ld follow, that justification is impossible. But if faith necessarily must
be joined with charity and good works, so that otherwise it is not faith,
but a shadow or counterfeit of it: then it follows, that justification, in
that it depends upon a true faith, does also depend upon works, and upon love
which is the fulfilling of the Law; and consequently, that no man can be
certain of his justification, but that justification is a thing altogether
impossible. And in this argument he does so please himself, that he concludes
with this Epiphonema: forsooth so stable is the dogmaticall building of
heretics, that on each side it threatens ruin.

I answer briefly by distinction; that justification is either before God in
foro coelesti, or in the Court of our own Conscience. Before God, when the
Lord imputing the perfect righteousness of Christ to a believing sinner,
absolveth him from the guilt of his finne and from damnation, and accepts of
him as righteous in Christ, and as an heir of eternal life, and this properly
is the justification of a sinner. That justification, which is in the Court of
Conscience, is not justification it self, but the assurance of it. Howbeit,
commonly, men are then said to be justified, and to have pardon of sin, when
the pardon is sealed to their own Conscience. I deny therefore that our
justification before God consists in the assurance thereof in our own
conscience (for those which truly believe, are justified and blessed, whether
they be assured thereof or not) or that it depends upon our charity or our
own good works, but that without respect of our charity, or any worthiness
in us, the Lord does freely Romans 3. 24.
and of his mere grace, even when we deserve the contrary, justify us so
soon as we truly believe in Christ; that, and no other being the condition
of the covenant. And howsoever the assurance of our justification before God,
if we were to be justified by our own obedience, were impossible; because to
our justification before God perfect and complete obedience is required, which
to us by reason of the flesh is impossible: yet the assurance of our
justification in our own conscience is not impossible, but is ordinarily
obtained by the children of God, by some more, by some less; because it does
not depend upon the perfection, but upon the uprightness of our obedience. If
we have a true desire, an unfeigned purpose, a sincere endeavor to walk before
God in the obedience of his commandments, though we fail, contrary to our
desire and purpose, in many particulars, we may thereby make our election, our
calling, our justification sure unto us. For by our works our faith is
demonstrated, and our justification known to our selves and others: in which
sense Saint James says we are justified by works.

. XI. In the seventh place Bellarmine adds the consent of the Fathers, into
whose mind, he says, De justis. l. 1. cap. 15.. Accedat septimo.
this absurdity never entered, that faith cannot be where charity is not. And
yet, for all this brag, he is not able to produce any one pregnant testimony
plainly affirming, that true faith, or justifying faith may be without
charity: we do not deny, but that the faith of Hypocrites and of all other
wicked and impenitent sinners, which is not a true and a lively but a
counterfeit and dead faith (which not properly, but catachrestically, or rather
equivocally is called faith) is severed from charity and from all other graces
of sanctification. And such is the faith, which the Fathers say may be severed
from charity. But though he has not cited any one pregnant testimony against
us, yet one he has cited for us in plain Gregor. in Evang. homil. 29.
terms avouching, that they do not truly believe, nor have true faith, who
do not live well; and to the same purpose I cited Augustine, and diverse others
of the Fathers.

CAP. IV. Whether justifying faith may be without special apprehension of
Christ.
. I. No justifying faith but that which lays hold on Christ.


THe third error of the Papists concerning the nature of justifying faith is,
that they hold it may be, as without knowledge, and without charity, so also
without any special apprehension or application of Christ to the believer. But
the Scriptures unto justification require, that we should believe in Christ.
For howsoever by that faith, which justifies we do believe whatsoever Heb.
11. 3, etc.
God has revealed in his Word: neither has any man a justifying faith, who
denies credit to any thing which he finds to be revealed by God:
notwithstanding as it justifyeth, it only respects Christ, either directly
and expressly, or indirectly and by consequence; Christ himself being, as I
shall hereafter show, the proper object of justifying faith. For the promise of
justification and salvation in the Gospel is not made to the belief of other
things, but only to true faith in Christ. Ioh. 3. 16, 18. 36. and 6. 29, 40,
47. Act. 8. 37. 16. 30, 31.
For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that
whosoever believes in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. And as
Moses lifted up the serpent Ioh. 3. 14, 15.
in the wilderness, that they who were bitten of the fiery serpents, by
looking on the brazen Serpent, which was a figure of Christ, should be healed:
even so the Son of man was to be lifted up upon the Cross, that whosoever
being stung by the old serpent the Devil, looks Ioh. 6. 40.
upon him with the ei^ of a true faith, that is believes in him, should not
perish, but have eternal life, which truth is acknowledged by the Sent. lib.
3. did. 19. ^.
Master of the sentences: quem Deus proposuit propitiatorem per fidem in
sanguine ipsius, i. per fidem passionis: ut ^lim aspicientes in Serpentem aneum
in lign^ erectu^, a morsibus serpentum sanabantur. Si ergo recto fidei intuitu
in illum respicimus qui pro nobis pependit in lig^o, a vinculis D^laboli
solvimur, i. peccatis. As therefore they who were bitten; by the same eyes,
wherewith they looked upon the brazen serpent, beheld all other things which
were subject to their view, but were cured by looking upon the serpent, and not
by beholding any other thing: so we by the same eye of the soul, which is
faith, do believe all other things, which God has propounded to be believed;
his Word being the objectum ad^quatum of our faith: but we are justified and
saved by believing in Christ, and not by believing of any other thing. In so
much that if we should believe all other things and did not believe in Christ,
our faith would not justify us. And therefore, in the Scriptures, justifying
faith is ordinarily called faith in Act. 20 21. 24. 24 and 26. 18. G^l 3. 26.
Christ, and sometimes the faith Romans 3. 22. 16. Gol. 2. 16. 20. and 3. 22.
Phil. 3 9.
of Christ and sometimes his knowledge: Es^y. 53. 11.
whereby is meant, not that Christ is the subject but the proper object of
justifying faith, which is a truth so manifest, that no Christian ought to
doubt of it. For all true Christians are so called, because they believe in
Christ, and, by believing in him, do hope to be saved by him.

. II. Now to believe in Christ is to receive him, Ioh. 1. 12. and To believe in
Christ is to re ceive him.
not to receive him, is not to believe in him, verse. 11. For to receive Christ
being so far removed from us, is a spiritual action of the soul, that is to
say, of the mind and of the heart, whereby we first apprehend, and after apply
Christ unto our selves. If therefore it be asked August in Joan tract. 50.
qu^modo tenebo absentem? quomodo in coel^m manum mittam ut ibi sedentem
teneam? how should I lay hold upon him that is absent? how should I send up my
hand into heaven, to lay hold on him sitting there? Augustine answers, fidem
mitte and tenuisti. Send up thy faith, and thou have laid hold on him. But
first, we receive Christ in our mind and judgment by assent, which if it be
a bare^ and as it were a literal and uneffectuall assent, we receive him at
the most as the Savior of the World, but not as our Savior; which is the
faith of hypocrites, yea, and of Devils, and is all, that the Papists require,
as necessary, to true faith. But if it be a spiritual, lively, and effectual
assent, it works upon the heart, that is, both the affections and the will,
so that he which in his judgment truly and effectually assenteth to the
truth of the Gospel, that Jesus the Son of the Blessed Virgin, is the
eternal Son of God, the Messiah and Savior of all that truly believe in
him, does also in his heart embrace him, heartily desiring to be made partaker
of him, and in his will unfainedly purposing and resolving to acknowledge him
to be our Lord and Savior, and to rest upon him alone for salvation. By the
former, which is only a bare assent, we do after a sort credere Christum,
acknowledging him to be the Savior of those that believe in him: by the
latter, which is the lively and effectual assent working upon the heart, we
do credere in Christum, and receive him to be our Savior, whereupon
necessarily follows affiance in Christ, and love of him as our Savior. Thus
then by a true belief we receive and embrace Christ: in our judgments by a
lively assent, in our hearts desiring earnestly to be partakers of him, (which
desire we express by hearty prayer) and in our will^ resolving to acknowledge
and profess him to be our only Savior, and to rest upon him alone for
salvation. So that a true lively and effectu^ll faith, is the work of the
whole soul, that is to say, as well of the heart as of the mind: for which
cause the Apostle says, cord creditur adjustitiam with the heart man
believes to righteousness, Romans 10. 10. and Saint Luke that the Lord opened
the heart of Lydia, to assent to the Gospel, Act. 16. 14. And Philip requires
the Eunuch to believe with his whole heart. Act. 8. 37. The former is common to
the wicked, yea to the Devils, the later is proper to the children of God. For
those, who so believe, are born of God, Ioh. ^. 12, 13. 1 Ioh. 5. 1. The former
is a literal, a dead, a counterfeit, a not justifying faith; the latter is a
lively, true, and justifying faith. This distinction Augustine In epist. Joan.
tract. ^0.
makes between Saint Peter's faith, and that of the Devils, though their
confessions were alike. Thou art the Son of the living God. Hoc dicebat
Petrus, ut Christum amplecteretur, hoc dicebant. Daemones, ut Christus ab eis
recederet. This said Peter, that he might embrace Christ: this spoke the
Devils that Christ might depart from them. Oecumenius In Iam. 2.
endeavoring to reconcile the seeming differences between the two Apostles
Paul and James, says there are two significations of the word Faith, the one,
as it signifies (...) a simple and bare assent, in which sense the Devils are
said to believe, that there is one God; the other, as it imports (...) the
accompanying of the disposition or affection with the firm assent. Of the
former Saint James speaks, and says, that the simple and bare assent is a
dead faith: but Paul of the latter, which is not destitute of good works,
which after he calls (...) that which is faith indeed.

. III. Of this faith, whereby we receive Christ to be our Savior, The
degrees of faith.
there are two degrees: the former, of special apprehension, whereby we
receive and embrace Christ, consisting in a lively and effectual belief,
whereby we truly receive Christ: in our judgment by a willing assent; in our
affections, by an earnest desire to be made partakers of him and of his
merits, which is the desire of application; in our will, by a settled resolution
to acknowledge him to be our Savior, and to rest upon him for salvation,
which is the unfeigned purpose and endeavor of application. So that in this
first degree, though we are not able actually to apply the promise of the
Gospel unto our selves; yet that application is both desired, and intended.
The other is of actual and special application of the promise to our selves,
as having the condition of the promise. The former is fides principiorum being
grounded on the express Word of God, whosoever believes in Christ, shall be
saved. The other is fides conclusionum, necessarily deduced from the Word by
application, in a practical syllogism, after this manner: whosoever believes
in Christ shall be saved, which general is true in every particular, as the
Apostle teaches, Romans 10. 9. (...) therefore thou do believe in Christ,
thou shall be saved: but I, says the faithful man, do believe in Christ;
therefore I shall be saved: which conclusion cannot be false, the premises
being true. To the former all men are necessarily tied under pain of
damnation, John 3. 18. Mark. 16. 16. to the latter none are tied, but they
only, who have the former. For the former is the condition of the promise,
which whosoever has not, he ought not to apply the promise to himself,
unless he will perniciously deceive himself. By the former we are justified
before God in the court of Heaven, which is properly called justification: by
the latter we are justified in the court of our conscience, which is not
properly justification, but the assurance of it. The former goes before
remission of sin, the latter follows after. The former is the work of Gods
Spirit, as he does 1 Ioh. 5. 1. Ioh. 1. 12, 13.
regenerate us in our first effectual calling; the latter as he is the spirit
of adoption sealing us after we Ephesians. 1. 13.
have believed. The former is ordinarily wrought by the hearing of the Word,
the holy Ghost opening the Act. 16. 14.
heart of the hearer to assent thereto, and not by the ministry of the
Sacraments, which being the seals Romans 4. 11.
of that righteousness which is by faith, were ordained to this purpose to
confirm our faith in the application of the promise in particularunto our
selves, and in the particular assurance of our justification and salvation by
Christ: that those who have the first degree offaith may proceed to the second.
For if thou do truly believe, that Christ is the Savior: thou art bound to
believe, that he is thy Savior; otherwise thou Ioh. 5. 10.
make God a liar. That therefore thou may learn to apply Christ unto thy
self, God by his minister delivers to thee in particular the Sacrament as it
were a pledge, to assure thee in particular, that as the Minister does deliver
unto thee the outward sign: so the Lord does communicate unto thee that
beleevest according to the first degree of faith, the thing signified, that is
to say. Christ with all his merits, to thy justification, sanctification and
salvation.

. IV. This distinction of the degrees of faith, as it is most comfortable, The
use of this distinction.
for hereby we are taught how to attain to assurance of salvation, as
elsewhere Covenant of grace. cap. 8.
I have showed; for having the first degree, which is the condition of the
promise, thou may apply the promise to thy self, and by application attain
to assurance: so it is most true, and most necessary to be held. And first as
touching the former degree, The former degre^.
which is the special apprehension and embracing of Christ by a lively assent,
accompanied with the desire of the heart and resolution of the will as I have
said, that it is that faith, which is the condition of the promise, and by
which we are justified before God, I have proved by plain testimonies of
Scriptures, and other pregnant proofs. The places of Scripture, which I
alleged, were these, Mat. 16. 16. 17. Ioh. 20. 31. Act. 8. 37. 38. Romans 10. 9.
10. 1 Ioh. 5. 1. 5. Whereunto may be added. 1 Ioh. 4. 15. Among the manifold
proofs, which I produced, this is one; that if there be no other justifying
faith but the special faith, whereby we are assured of the remission of our
sins; then two absurdities will follow. The one, that we must apply the
promises to our selves, before we have the condition thereof, which as we
ought not to do, lest we play the hypocrites, so we cannot do unless we
will perniciously deceive our selves. The promise is whosoever believes in
Christ has remission of sin, whosoever believes in Christ shall be saved,
etc. This promise is made to none but to those who truly believe, and are
endued with a justifying faith, which is the condition of the promise. It is
evident therefore, that a man must be endued with justifying faith, before he
can apply the promise, and he must apply the promise before he can have any
assurance by special faith. The second absurdity is, that a man must be
assured that his sins be forgiven before they be forgiven; and so must
believe a lie, yea that a man must be assured, that they are forgiven, to the
end that they may be forgiven, which is a great absurdity. This therefore is an
undeniable truth, that before we can either apply the promises, or attain to
assurance of remission of sin; we must be endued with true justifying faith,
which is the condition of the promise, and the means to obtain remission. I
must believe therefore by a justifying faith, before I can have remission of
sins; I must have remission of sins, before I can have any assurance
thereof: and I must ascend by many degrees of assurance, before I come to full
assurance; which yet in this life is never so full, but that still more may,
and ought to be added to it.

. V. As touching the second, which by some is called special faith, The
special faith.
not only in respect of the object, which is Christ, for so the former is also
special, but in respect of the effect, which is, by actual application of the
Promises to a man's self, to assure him in particular of his justification and
salvation: It is by some both protestant and popish writers called fiducia,
that is, affiance. Howbeit the most of our Writers by it meant, assurance. But
unproperly howsoever, for neither is faith affiance, nor affiance assurance.

This special apprehension and application of Christ, though scorned by the
Papists, yet is it, of all graces, the most comfortable, most profitable, most
necessary. Most comfortable, for the very life of this life is the assurance of
a better life. Most necessary, because without this special receiving of
Christ, first, by apprehension, and then by application, we can have no other
saving grace. How can we love God, or our neighbor for Gods sake, how can we
hope and trust in him, how can we rejoice in him, or be thankful to him, if
we be not persuaded of his love and bounty toward us? and so of the rest. Most
profitable, because from it all other graces proceed; and according to the
measure of it, is the measure of all other graces, as I have elsewhere showed.
For if the love of God be shed abroad in thy heart by the Holy Ghost, that is,
if by faith thou art persuaded of Gods love toward thee: thou will be moved to
love the Lord, and thy neighbor for his sake, then will thou hope and trust in
him, then will thou rejoice in him, and be thankful unto him, and so forth.
And the greater thy persuasion is of his love and goodness toward thee, so
much the greater will be thy love, thy hope, thy trust, thy thankfulness, thy
rejoicing in him, etc. When as therefore the Papists detest and scorn our
Doctrine concerning special faith, they do plainly bewray themselves to have
no saving grace, nor any truth or power of Religion in them.

. VI. But that this special receiving and embracing of Christ by The special
receiving of Christ necessary to justification.
faith is necessary to justification, and that faith does not justify without
it, it does evidently appear by the third and fourth points before handled, in
the fourth and fifth Books. For if we be justified only by the righteousness
of Christ which is out of us in him, then are we not justified by faith as it
is an habit or quality inherent in us, but as it is the hand and instrument
whereby we receive Christ his righteousness: which, as it is imputed to us by
God, so we apprehend it by faith. And because faith alone does receive Christ
and all his merits; therefore the same benefits, which we receive from Christ,
and are properly to be ascribed unto him, as the Author of them, are in the
Scriptures attributed also to faith, because by faith we receive Christ. By
Christ we live, Ioh. 6. 57. We live by faith, Gal. 2. 20. Hab. 2. 4. By Christ
we have remission of sins, Ephesians. 1. 7. Act. 13. 38. By faith we have
remission of sins, Act. 8. 39. 26. 18.

By Christ we are justified, Esai. 53. 11. We are justified by faith, Romans 3.
28. Gal. 3. 24.

By Christ we have peace with God, Col. 1. 20. We have peace with God by faith,
Romans 5. 2.

We have free access to God by Christ, Ephesians. 2. 18. 3. 12. Heb. 10. 19.

We have free access to God by Faith, Romans 5. 2. Ephesians. 3. 12.

We are sanctified by Christ, 1 Cor. 1. 30. Heb. 10. 14.

We are sanctified by Faith, Act. 15. 9.

We overcome the world by Christ, Ioh. 16. 33.

We overcome the world by Faith, 1 Ioh. 5. 4, 5.

We are the Sons of God by Christ, Ephesians. 1. 5.

We are the Sons of God by Faith, Gal. 3. 26.

We have an heavenly inheritance by Christ, Gal. 4. 7.

We have an heavenly inheritance by Faith, Act. 26. 18.

We attain to Eternal life by Christ, 1 Ioh. 5. 11, 12.

We attain to Eternal life by Faith, Ioh. 3. 16. and 5. 24. and 6. 47.

We are saved by Christ, Ioh. 3. 17. Matthew. 1. 21.

We are saved by Faith, Ephesians. 2. 8.

All which benefits are attributed to faith, not absolutely, but relatively, in
respect of the object which it does receive; being no otherwise caused or
procured by faith, but as it is the hand and instrument, whereby we receive
Christ, who is our life, Ioh. 14. 6. Col. 3. 6. our righteousness, Ier. 23. 6.
1 Corinthians. 1. 30. our propitiation, Romans 3. 25. 1 Ioh. 2. 2. our peace, Ephesians.

5. 11, 12.

. VII. But if we do not receive and embrace Christ by a lively Without it
Christ's merits avail us not to justification.
assent, at the least, working in our hearts an unfeigned desire to be made
partakers of him, and in our wills a settled resolution to acknowledge him to
be our Savior, and to rest upon him alone for Salvation, without this
special apprehension and application; at least in desire and intent: Christ
and his merits do not avail them, that are adulti, and come to years of
discretion, unless it be to their greater condemnation: who not caring to lay
hold upon Christ and to apprehend and apply his merits unto them, suffer, as
much as in them lies, his precious blood to be spilt in vain, as it is in
vain to them, who do not apprehend and seek to apply it to themselves. For
though the obedience of Christ both active and passive be a robe of
righteousness and our very wedding garment to cover our nakedness and our
sins: yet it will not cover us, unless it be put on. Though his stripes and
sufferings be a sovereign salve to cure our souls, yet it will not cure them
unless it be apply^d. Though his Body be meat indeed and his Blood be drink
indeed to nourish us unto eternal life; yet they will not yield nourishment
unto us, unless we eat his Body, and drink his Blood; all which is done by
faith apprehending and applying Christ, whereby we put on him and his
righteousness, apply the salve of his sufferings, eat his Body and drink his
Blood. The which, because the Papists want, and wanting reject; they are feign
to flee to their outward formalities, wherein their religion consists, and to
their opus operatum in the Sacraments, as if they without a true and lively
faith were able to justify and to save them; without which notwithstanding our
blessed Savior himself does not avail men to salvation. He that believes
and is baptized shall be saved; but he that believes not being adultus, though
he be baptized and receive all the Sacraments of the Romance Church, he
shall notwithstanding be condemned. Mar. 16. 16. Ioh. 3. 18, 36. It is
therefore plain and evident, that the faith, which does justify, must not be
a bare assent, but a lively belief or assent, specially apprehending and
embracing, and in desire at the least and purpose applying Christ unto us. For
actual application cannot be made until we find our selves to have the
condition of the promise, which is that former degree of faith: which being
had, and finding our selves to have it; we are actually to apply the promise,
and by application to gather assurance, which some call special faith.

. VIII. Now let us see what the Papists can object against this The Papists
objections against special faith.
clear truth. There are two things, or rather names, which they dispute
against, viz. fides specialis, and fiducia, special faith and affiance: which
dispute notwithstanding hinders not anything which I have spoken of the nature
of justifying faith, as it justifies us before God. For of justification,
taken in a large sense, there are two degrees, though of that which properly is
called justification before God, there neither are nor can be any degrees, as
I have showed. The former is the justification of a sinner before God in the
Court of Heaven, by imputation of Christ's righteousness apprehended by a
lively assent or belief. The second is our justification in the Court of our
own Conscience, when we are persuaded and in some measure assured of our
justification, which assurance, of some, is called fides specialis, by which,
we are not first justified before God: but is then wrought in us, when being
already justified by faith, the holy Ghost the Spirit of promise shedding
abroad Romans 5. 5.
the love of God in our hearts, seals us after we have believed, Ephesians. 1. 13.
How beit, the former degree of faith is also truly called special, both in
respect of the special object which is Christ, and in regard of the special
effect, which is the special apprehension or embracing of Christ, not only in
the judgment by a lively assent, but also in the heart that is the will and
affections, by a desire to be made partaker of him and his merits, and by a
settled will and resolution to acknowledge him to be our Savior, and to rely
upon him alone for salvation. And in this sense that faith by which we are
justified before God is a special faith. But if that only be called special
faith by which we are justified in our own Consciences, that is, assured of
our justification, that assurance arising from the actual application of the
promise to our selves: then I say and avouch, that this special faith is not
that by which we are justified before God. For we must have a justifying faith,
being the condition of the promise, before we can proceed to application, and
first we must be justified before God, before we can have any assurance
thereof in our own Consciences: when as therefore the Papists dispute against
t^is special faith, proving that by it we are not ^ustified before God, they
plead besides the purpose. And yet, for all their proofs, it is truly called
a justifying faith, because by it we are justified in the Court of our own
Conscience. Their objections concerning fiducia.


. IX. The like is to be said of Fiducia or affiance which is called (...)
against which the Papists hotly dispute: proving, that it is not of the essence
of justifying faith: when notwithstanding diverse of their own Writers, as well
as of ours, have expounded credere by fidere and fides by fiducia. But they
should understand, that many of our Writers, by affiance mean assurance, which
is the plerophorie of faith: unproperly, I confess, but that was their
meaning* As for affiance, though it be not of the proper nature and essence of
faith: yet it is an unseparable fruit of special faith, in so much that
sometimes it seems to be employed in the signification of believing in Christ:
For he that does believe in Christ, does first by a lively assent acknowledge
him to be the Savior of all that truly believe in him: and secondly, so
believing he is persuaded that he is a Savior to him; and thirdly, believing
Christ to be his Savior, does therefore repose his affiance and trust in him
for salvation. But howsoever so much sometimes is employed in the phrase of
believing in Christ, yet in the most ordinary and usual acception of the Word
in the Scriptures of the New Testament, no more is signified than the lively
assent and acknowledging of Christ: yea, sometimes the phrase is used of those
who did not so much as give a lively assent, or believed with their heart.
Howsoever being convicted by the evidence of truth sealed by miracles, they
assented to the truth, and acknowledged Christ to be the Messiah. Such were
those, Ioh. 2. 23. who are said to have believed on his name, when they saw the
miracles which he did: to whom notwithstanding our Savior would give no
credit because he knew what was in them. Such a believer was Sim^ Magus, who
being convinced by the evidence of truth confirmed by miracles, assented in his
judgment but believed not with his heart: for his heart was not right within
him, Act. 8. 13. 21. And such a one was Judas, Ioh. 6. 64. who, though he
believed, as being a Disciple, yea an Apostle of Christ, yet believed not in
deed and in truth.

. X. But that the phrase is used ordinarily of those which received By a lively
assent men believe in Christ.
Christ by a true and lively assent, I could prove by multitude of testimonies,
diverse whereof I have elsewhere mentioned. But I will content my self with two
instances of the Samaritanes and of the Eunuch. Of the Samaritanes it is said,
John 4. 39. That many of them believed in Christ for the saying of the woman,
who could believe no more, than she had told them; which at the most, was, that
he was Christ. And after, when they professed, that they believed because of
his own word; all that they believed was this, that he was indeed the Christ,
the Savior of the world, verse 41. 42. The Eunuch, Act. 8. 37, 38.
when Philip told him, that he might be baptized, if he believed with his
whole heart, makes this profession of his faith; I believe that Jesus Christ
is the Son of God.

. XI. Now that affiance is not faith, I briefly show thus. First, That
as^iance is not faith.
because it is a fruit and effect of faith. For by faith we have affiance,
Ephesians. 3. 12. Faith therefore is the cause, affiance the effect* and the same
thing cannot be both the cause and the effect. For whereas some deny this
consequence, trusting to an unlike example; for say they, as natural
Philosophy is the science of natural things, and yet by it we attain to the
science of natural things: so, though affiance be faith, and faith affiance;
yet by faith we attain to affiance: I answer that there is an homonymie in
the word science, which in the former part of the example signifies the art or
doctrine, which is a comprehension of precepts: in the latter, the habit of the
knowledge of natural things, which by the doctrine helped with the gifts of
nature, and confirmed by exercise, we attain unto. Secondly, because faith is
an habit of the mind; affiance, an affection of the heart: and so also differ
in the subject. For faith, being a persuasion, is seated in the mind; though
working upon the heart; affiance or trust being an affection, is seated in the
heart, though proceeding from the persuasion of the mind. Thirdly, because
they differ not only in the Subject, but also in the Object. The Object of
faith is verum, that which is true: the Object of affiance is bonum, that which
is good. Yea, but (say some the Promise is good, and therefore the Object of
^aith is good. I answer, the thing promised is good, and therefore I conceive
affiance or hope; which two, in respect of the time to come, differ not. But be
the thing promised never so good, yet I believe not the promise, unless I be
persuaded that it is true. Faith therefore lays hold on the Promise, as being
true; affiance or hope expect the thing promised, as being good. Those
therefore who hold, that affiance, properly so called, is faith; or faith
affiance, are not to be defended. Those which by affiance understand
assurance, and say, that justifying faith is affiance, do speak the truth, if
they understand by faith, not that by which we are justified before God, but
that by which we are justified, that is, assured of our justification in our
own conscience. Concerning which there needs not to be any other controversy
between us and the Papists, than this, whether there be any such certainty
or assurance to be had. But that is a different question, not pertinent to the
point in hand, which I have elsewhere Covenant of grace. cap. 8.
cleared. And so much of the nature of justifying faith.

CHAP. V. Of the Subject of justifying Faith.
. I.

NOw I come to the Subject, that is, both the parties, The Subject of faith.
to whom it belongs; and the part of the Soul wherein it is. As touching the
parties in 1. The parties.
whom it is, the Papists hold. First, that it is common to the godly with the
wicked. Secondly, that it is common to the Elect with the reprobate. The former
is the same in substance with that, which I have already handled, whether true
faith may be severed from charity and other graces: the negative part of which
question, I have proved, and consequently of this, that justifying faith is not
common to the godly with the wicked. As touching the second, whether it be
common to the Elect with the Reprobate; Bellarmine De justi^. li. 3. cap. 14.
propounds the Romish tenet to be this, fidem and justitiam non esse propriam
elector^m, and semel habitam amitti posse: that faith and justice is not proper
to the Elect, and that it being once had, it may be lost; which is the very
question of perseverance, whereof I have written a full treatise against
Bellarmine, proving that true justifying faith is proper to the Elect, and that
being once had it is never lost, either totally or finally.

. II. Now as touching the part of the soul, wherein justifying 2. The part.
faith is seated, Bellarmine and many other Papist^ hold, that it is seated in
the understanding only: and of us they report, that we hold it to be seated in
the will only: which they do report against their own knowledge; knowing
that we hold faith to be a persuasion of the mind and an assent, and finding
fault with Calvin, for defining faith to be a kind of knowledge, as it is
indeed that kind of knowledge which we have by report or relation from God,
grounded upon the infallible authority of God the relator: and finally, not
being ignorant, that we hold the proper object of faith to be the truth. But we
hold, that it is seated both in the understanding and in the will: and my
reason brie^ely is this, because it is a voluntary assent, and is so defined,
not only by some of the ancient Fathers, but also by the ancient Philosophers,
who as Thcodore^ Therapent. li. 1. page 18.
reports do define it to be (...) a willing assent of the soul. Therefore,
to believe is an act, both of the understanding, and of the will. Of the
understanding, as it is an assent: of the will, as it is voluntary. Even as
liberum ^rbitrium, as it is arbitrium, belongs to the understanding; and as
it is liberum, to the will: not that we seat it in two diverse parts of the
soul, but only in the mind, that is the reasonable or intellectual part,
though it works upon the affections also. For the better understanding
whereof, we are to know, that when the holy Ghost is pleased to work the
grace of faith in the souls of any of the elect, which ordinarily he does Rom
10. 14, 17
by the ministry of the Gospel, he opens their hearts as he did the heart
of Lydia Act. 16. 14.
to assent to the Gospel: which he does, first, by illuminating their
understanding; and opening the eyes of their mind, that they may rightly
conceive and judge of the doctrine of salvation: and secondly, by opening, as
it were, the ears of the mind, and enclining the will to affect and embrace,
what the understanding has judged and approved to be true and good. The
understanding therefore approving, and the Will (which is intellectus extensus,
and ordinarily follows the judgment of the practick understanding) embracing
the doctrine of the Gospel, which promises salvation by Christ to all that
believe: the mind, which contains both these faculties, being thus opened by
the holy Ghost, does williugly assent to the doctrine of the Gospel concerning
salvation by Christ. Faith therefore is a voluntary assent of the mind to the
promise of the Gospel; unto which, the acts of both the faculties of the mind
concur; of the understanding, to judge, that the thing propounded to be
believed, is true and good. I mean, that the promise is true, and the thing
promised good: of the Will, to accept and to embrace that for true and good,
which the understanding has judged to be such. Out of both which arises the
voluntary assent of the mind, which we call faith. This faith thus wrought by
the holy Ghost, (the Spirit of regeneration) being lively and effectual,
works upon the heart and affections; which also being renewed by the holy
Ghost, readily follow the willing assent of the mind, both to affect Christ,
to desire to be made partakers of him, to love him, and torest upon him for
salvation: and also to dis-affect and to detest those things, which are
repugnant to the Doctrine of the Gospel; the chief whereof is Sin.

. III. Now that the act of the will does concur to faith, and Testimonies,
that to believe is an act of the Will as well as of the Understanding.
that faith, which is an habit of the mind, is seated as well in the will as
in the understanding, is a thing testified by the Fathers, and confessed by the
Schoolmen and by the Modern Doctors of the Roman Church. And first for the
Fathers: Stromat. lib. 5. p^g. 251.
Clemens Alexandrinus, says, that faith it the willing assent of the soul,
and so Theodoret does define it, Therapeu^. l. 1. page 16.
(...).

Ambrose, In 2 Cor. 1. 24.
Fides non necessitatis, sed voluntatis res est. Faith is a matter of will and
not of necessity: therefore the Apostle says, not that we domineere over your
faith, for dominion is cause of necessity: and again, ^ to believe, or not to
believe, it is an act of the Will. o ^n Romans 4.


Augustine De bono persever. l. 2. cap. 16.
Grace therefore preventeth or goes before faith: otherwise if faith prevent
it, then also the will preven^eth it, quia fides sine volu^late ^on potest
esse, because faith cannot be without Will.

Again, De Spirit. and litera cap. 31.
what is it to believe but to consent that the thing is true which is said?
consensio autemutique volentis est, and consenting undoubtedly is of him that
is willing. Every Ibid. c. 3^.
man when he wills, believes; and cum credit, volens credit, and when he
does believe, he does willingly believe.

Voluntate Ibid. c. 33.
utique credimus, verily we believe with our will.

Epist. 23 de Baptism. parvulorum.
Fides in credentium voluntate consistit, faith stands in the will of the
believers.

And writing upon Ioh. 6. 44. In Joan. tract. 26.

against his will, he may come to the Altar nilling, he may receive the
Sacrament, nilling, credere non potest, nisi volens, he cannot believe unless
he be willing.

And lastly, De predestin. sanct. lib. 1. c. 5. in sine. Schoolmen.
in the elect the will is prepared of the Lord, that therefore belongs to
faith, qu^ in voluntate est, which is in the will.

self. Unto the being of the virtue of faith, with the act of reason or
understanding concurreth the act of the Will.

Faith Ibid.
never should be a virtue, though it did enlighten the understanding never so
much, if it did not also rectify the will.

Thomas Aquinas In Romans 10. lect. 2.
writing on Romans 10. 10. Signanter autem dicit, cord creditur, id est,

the Will. For all other things which appertain to the outward worship of God,

but none can believe that is not willing: for the understanding of him that
believes is not determined to assent unto the truth by necessity of reason, as
of him that has science, but by the Will.

did not concredit himself to them, for such a faith does not justify. For as
science is begotten by virtue of demonstrative reason: so faith is not
demonstrated, but is undertaken by the virtue or power of the will captivating
the understanding unto the obedience of Christ, who does infuse it: wherefore
Augustine tract. 26. in Joan. other things says he a man may do against his
will, but none can believe, but he that is willing.

. VI. Thus have I proved against Bellarmine, that to believe is an Whether the
Understanding be commanded by the Will.
act of the will, as well as of the understanding; and that the seat of faith
is neither the understanding alone, nor the will alone, but the mind which
comprehends both. Howbeit, I cannot altogether subscribe to the judgment of
the Schoolmen, and other learned men, whether Protestants or Papists, who
teach, that the understanding is commanded by the will to assent unto divine
truths and that it does credere ex imperio voluntatis. For I do not conceive,
how the will, which is intellectus extensus and follows the judgment of the
practike understanding, in so much that it wills nothing, but what the
understanding approves and judges to be willed; how it, I say, should command
the understanding. Neither does their reason satisfy; which is this: that the
understanding of man, in matters pertaining to Science, is determined to one
thing by the evidence of the thing, or necessity of reason, not by the Will:
but the understanding of man in matters belonging to faith, which sometimes
surpass the capacity of humane reason cannot be determined to any particular,
either by the evidence of the thing, or by necessity of reason, both which are
wanting in the objects of faith, which are things hoped for and things not
seen. And therefore, say they, there can no assent be given, unless the
understanding be commanded by the will to assent. But I answer, as the ground
of knowing things by Science is the evidence of the thing or necessity of
reason: so the ground of believing things is the authority of God speaking in
his word, which is infallible, and in certainty surpasses the grounds of
Science, and by it the understanding is determined to such particulars, as it
conceives to be revealed of God. As therefore in things of science, which the
understanding does judge to be evident, and of necessary truth, the will does
readily embrace them, following therein the judgment of the understanding: and
so the mind which contains both faculties, does willingly, and yet
necessarily, assent thereto, moved thereunto by the evidence of necessary truth:
so in matters of faith, which the understanding, though it comprehends them
not, yet does judge infallibly true, moved thereto by the authority of God
revealing those truths; the Will, as I conceive, being captivated by the
understanding, and submitting it self to the judgment thereof; the mind does
willingly, and yet necessarily assent to such truths revealed by God, moved
thereunto by the infallible authority of God speaking in his Word. Which in
certainty of truth does far surmount all grounds of science: and does
captivate the understanding; and it the Will. Why therefore the assent to
divine truths which are grounded upon a most certain and in^allible
soundation, which persuades the understanding, should more proceed from the
Will, than the assent to humane sciences, I cannot conceive, or why the Will
should command the understanding in them, more than in matters of science.

CAP. VI. Of the object of justifying faith.
. I.

SO much of the subject: now we come to the object of justifying ^aith; where
the question ought not to be made coneeming the object of faith at large, but
of that object which is proper to faith, as it justifies. For we do freely
confes^e, that the object of faith, is all and every truth revealed unto us by
God: and that the word of God is objectum fidei adaquatum, the even object of
^aith (that is, we are bound to believe whatsoever is contained in the word;
but what is not contained in the word of God, we are not to believe it as a
matter of ^aith.) And that therefore by the ^ame faith by which we are
justified, we believe whatsoever is contained in the written word of God,
whether expressly, or by necessary consequence. So that Bellarmine De justif.
l. 1. c. 8. and 9.
might have saved a great deal of labor idly spent in proving that, which
we confess, that by faith we believe the creation Heb. 1^3.
, and all other truths revealed in the word: yea, we profess him to have no
true justifying faith, who denies credit to any thing, which he finds
revealed by God. Howbeit the Papi^ extend this object, not only to the
Cano^icall Scriptures, but also to those which we, according to all (almost)
antiquitie^ call Apocryphal: and not only to the written word, but also to
their unwritten verities, as they call the traditions of the Church of Rome;
that is, such doctrines and ordinances, as that Church does teach and observe,
having no ground nor warrant in the Scriptures. The which notwithstanding
whiles they do not only match, but also prefer them before the written
word, do evidently prove the Pope, who by their doctrine is above the Church,
and the Church above the Scriptures, to be Antichrist. But this is another
controversy whereinto I may not now make an excu^sion. Only I desire the
Reader to take notice of this mark among others of the Catholic Aposta^ie of
the Roman Church, which has not only departed from the ancient doctrine and
rule of faith, which is the Scriptures; but also have set up a new rule, the
last resolution of their faith being into the infallible judgment, and
irrefragable authority of the Bishop of Rome: and to this purpose let him
consider these two testimonies of Saint B^sil, Basil. Ascet. de fide. (...).
it is a manifest falling away from the faith, and conviction of pride, either
to reject any of those things that are written, or to bring in any of those
things that are not written.

The other Ethic. (...) 80. The proper object of justifying faith.
: (...). All that is without the Scripture inspired of God, being not of faith
is sin.

. II. But howsoever by that faith, which justifies, we believe all and every
truth revealed by God; yet the proper and formal Object of justifying faith,
quat^nus justificat, and by believing whereof it does justify, is not every
truth, but that only, which (...) is called the Truth, that is Christ with all
his merits, Ioh. 14. 6. or the Doctrine of Salvation by Christ, or the Promises
of the Gospel concerning justification and salvation by Christ, which often
times in the Scripture is called the Truth, as Ioh. 1. 17. and 5. 33. and 8.
31, 32. and as some think, Ioh. 8. 44. and by Christ^ own Exposition, Ioh.
17. 17. so Ioh. 18. 37. Romans 2. 8. ^al. 3. 1. and 5. 7. Ephesians. 4. 21. 2 Thessalonians. 2.
10, 12. 1 Timothy 2. 4. and 4. 3. 2 Timothy 2. 18. cum 1 Timothy 1. 19. 2 Timothy 3. 8.
Heb. 10. 26, 1 Pet. 1. 22. 1 Ioh. 2. 21. 2 Job. 1. 2. Sometimes, the word of
Truth, or of the truth, Ephesians. 1. 13. 2 Timothy 2. 15. Iam. 1. 18. sometimes the
truth of the Gospel, Gal. 2. 5. 14. or the word of the truth of the Gospel,
Col. 1. 5. The (...) whereof is Christ crucified, 1 Cor. 1. 23. and 2. 2. For
this cause justifying faith is called oftentimes the faith of Christ, because
he is the proper Object thereof, as Romans 3. 22, 26. Gal. 2. 16. 20. and 3. 22.
Phil. 3. 9. and faith in Christ, as Act. 20. 21. and 24. 24. and 26. 18. Gal.
3. 26. Faith in the blood of Christ, Romans 3. 25. that faith which is in Christ
Jesus, 2 Ti^. 3. 15. sometimes the faith of the Gospel, Phil. 1. 27. and which
is all one, the faith of the truth, 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13. Thus therefore I reason:

That, to the beli^e whereof alone and not of other things, remission of
sins, justification and salvation is promised, that, I say is the proper
object of justifying faith.

But to the belief in Christ, or in the Doctrine and promises of the Gospel,
concerning salvation by Christ, remission of sins, justification and salvation
is promised, and not to the belief of other things:

Therefore that is the proper object of justifying faith.

That the Promise is made to belief in Christ, and in the Gospel, the
Scriptures every wh^re ^each, as Ioh. 3. 15, 16. 18. 36. and 8. 24. and 11. 25,
26. and ^2. 46. and 20. 31. Act. 10. 43. and 13. 38, 39. and 16, 31. and 26.
18. Romans 10. 9, 11. etc. But not to the belief of other things is the promise
made, as of the Law, or of the story of the Bible, or of predictions, excepting
those stories and prophe^ies which concern Christ. For howsoever a man cannot
have a justifying faith, who denies credit to any of those other things which
he finds to be revealed by God; yet not by believing of them, but by
believing in Christ, ^hee is justified.

. III. But here it may be objected, that the faith, whereby Abraham was
justified, had no relation to the promise of salvation by Christ, Obj.
concerning the object of Abraham's faith.
but to the promises of God concerning his seed. Whereunto I answer, First,
that Abraham and all the rest of the faithful before Christ, believed in the
promised seed, which was the Messiah to come, and by that faith, as the Papists
themselves confess, were justified. Secondly, the promises, which concerned
his seed, were either the same with the promise of the Gospel, or it was
employed in them. The maine promise was, that in Abraham, that is, in his seed,
all Nations, that is, the faithful in all Nations, should be blessed. For
Abraham did not conceive, that in himself all Nations should be blessed, as if
himself should be the foundation of Happiness unto All, but in his seed. And
so the Lord himself explaneth in Genesis 22. 18. and in thy seed, that is, in
Christ, all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed. And so Zachary Luke 1.
68. 69, 73. and Peter, Act. 3. 25. This promise made to Abraham is the very
same with the promise of the Gospel. For, as the Apostle says, the Scripture
foreseeing, that God would justify the Heathen through faith, (...) preached,
before, the Gospel to Abraham, saying, in thee (that is, in thy seed) shall
all nations be blessed. Which promise, as it had been formerly made to our
first parents Genesis 3. 15.
concerning the promised seed, so was it after renewed to Isaac, Genesis 26. 4.
and to Jacob, Genesis 28. 14. and, in effect, to David Psalm. 72. 17.
, whose son according to the flesh Messiah was to be: who is therefore called
the son of David, and the branch of David. In this promised seed Abraham and
all other the faithful believed, and by believing in Him were justified.

. IV. The other promises concerning his seed are two. The former, The two other
promises.
concerning the multiplication of his seed; that he should be Father of a
multitude of Nations, namely in Christ; and that he would be a God to him and
his seed, he does not say to seeds, as of many, but as of one, and to thy
seed, which is Christ, Gal. 3. 16. that is Christ mystical, 1 Cor. 12. 12.
containing the multitude of the faithful in all Nations, both Jews and
Gentiles. This promise therefore implies the former, that in Christ the
promised seed Abraham himself and his seed, that is, the faithful of all
nations, should be blessed, and in confirmation of this promise he was called
Abraham, because he was to be a Father of many nations, that is, of the
faithful of all nations, for none but they are accounted Abraham's seed, Romans
9. 7, 8. Gal. 3. 7. 29. and for the same cause he received the Sacrament of
Circumcision, He believed in the Lord, and it was imputed unto him for
righteousness, that is, because he believed in the Lord, he was reputed a
righteous m^n, and so Vatablus i^ Genesis 15. 6. Romans 4. 10.
as a seal of that righteousness which is by faith, Romans 4. 11. And that in
this promise of the multiplication of his seed, the promise of the Gospel was
included, appears, because his faith in this promise was imputed to him for
righteousness, not for the the approbation or justifying of that act; as it
happened in the zealous act of Phineas, Psalm. 106. 30. but for the
justification of his person, which could not be justified, but by faith in
Christ. Which the Papists themselves cannot deny. The chief thing which
Abraham apprehended in the promise concerning his seed was, that although he
were an hundred year old, and Sarah past childbearing, yet he should have
seed by her, and in that seed himself, and all the faithful of all Nations
should be blessed.

. V. The latter is, that they should possess the land of promise, by The
latter.
which, as by a type, was signified the heavenly Canaan; under which, to all
the faithful was promised the Kingdom of heaven, which was the Country,
which they, professing themselves Pilgrims, did seek, Heb. 11. 13, 14, 15,
16. and into which eternal rest Jesus was to bring them who bele^ve; even as
Joshua the type of Christ, who also is called Heb. 4. 9.
Jesus, brought the Israelites, after their peregrinations, into that land of
rest. So that in the latter Promises concerning his seed, and the land of
promise, the former was employed concerning the promised seed and blessedness
by him, as the principal object of Abraham's faith, for which chiefly he did
so much affect and desire seed. Insomuch that when the Lord had promised him to
be his buckler and his exceeding great reward, Abraham replied, Lord God what
will thou give me seeing I go childlesse. As Abraham therefore who rejoiced
Ioh. 8. 56.
to see our Savior Christ's day; and as he, and the rest of the faithful
having not received the promises concerning the promised seed; but having seen
them a far off, were persuaded of them, that is, believed them, and Heb. 11.
13.
embraced them, were justified by faith in Christ, the promised seed; so are
we, and by nothing else.

And further, we are to note, that before those words recorded, Genesis 15. 6.
Abraham had by faith embraced the maine promise of the Gospel, Genesis 12. 3. in
thee, that is, in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed: and
by that faith was justified, by which also he obeyed God, Heb. 11. 8, 9, 14, 16.
leaving his own country, and, by the same faith, sojourning in the land of
promise as a Pilgrim, sought a better country, that is, an heavenly.
Therefore as S. James says, when Abraham in his great trial Iam. 2. 23.
had approved himself to be a faithful man; that then the Scripture was
fulfilled, which says* Abraham believed God, and it was imputed to him for
righteousness: Not that then Abraham first believed, but that then by that
notable fruit of faith, he approved the truth of his faith, and manifested the
truth of that oracle, which then by good proof was verified of him: So, by the
like reason, may that place, Genesis 15. 6. be understood, that Abraham believed
in the Lord, and it was counted to him for righteousness. Not, that then
Abraham, either first believed, or was then first justified, for he had
believed the grand promise of the Gospel before, and by it was justified; and
before this time had brought forth excellent fruits of faith, Genesis Chap. 12,
13, 14. but that by this new act of believing the Promises renewed (which the
Apostle amplifieth Romans 4. 18.) the truth of his faith was manifested. And thus
Bellarmine De justi^. l. 4. ca. 18. Possunt enim illa verba applicari adomne^
insignes actus fidei ejusdem Patriarchae.
himself expounds those words, Genesis 15. 6. affirming, that as S. James
applies them to that act, ^en. 22. so they may be applied to all notable acts
of the faith of Abraham.

Again, justification or imputation of righteousness is actus contin^us,
which is not to be restrained to the instant of our first conversion and
justification, but continued to them that believe. And therefore, so long as
they have faith, God imputes righteousness unto them.

. VI. But for the better clearing of this point, we are to take notice, Christ
the proper object of faith in two respects.
that Christ and his benefits, or the doctrine of salvation by Christ are the
proper object of justifying faith, in two respects, both as it justifi^th
before God and as in the Court of our own Conscience. Before God, when by a
lively and effectual assent or belief, as has been said we receive and
embrace Christ our Savior with all his merits, or, which is all one, the
promises of the Gospel concerning justification and salvation by him. Such was
the faith of Saint Peter, Math. 16. 16. and of the rest of the Apostles, Ioh.
6. 69. Of Nathaniel, Ioh. 1. 49. Of Martha, Ioh. 11. 27. Of the Samaritanes,

we finding, that we have the former degree, which is the condition of the

he has the condition; not only may, but must apply the promise of the
Gospel to himself, otherwise he makes God a liar, 1 Ioh. 5. 10. This
application, as has been said is made by a practical syllogism, the
proposition whereof or (...) is this: whosoever does truly believe in Christ
he shall be saved: the assumption or (...), but I, says the faithful man, do
believe in Christ: the conclusion or (...): therefore I shall be saved. This
conclusion is the voice of special faith. Such was the faith of Job chap. 19.
25. Of David, Psalm. 103, 3. Of Thomas, Ioh. 20. 28. Of Saint Paul, Gal. 2. 20.
and of all the faithful in the Scriptures: who in many places have applied,
and, as it were, appropriated to themselves the mercies of God in Christ. And
such is and ought to be the faith of all that truly believe. For the general
always includes the particular. If therefore thou do truly believe, that
Jesus is the Savior of all that truly believe in him, thou art then bound to
believe that he is thy Savior. Of this point, I have treated elsewhere,
Covenant of grace. Bellarmines objections. De iustif. l 1^ c. 8, etc. The
first, that the object of faith is whatsoever is revealed by God.
and have answered the objections, so many as I thought worth the answearing.

. VII. Now I come to Bellarmines dispute concerning the object of faith,
wherein he endeavors to prove and to maintain three things: First, that the
object of faith is not Gods special favor in Christ, but whatsoever God has
reve^led. Secondly, that men may be justified without special faith. Thirdly,
that men are not justified by special faith. As touching the first, we do
freely confess, that by the justifying faith we do believe, whatsoever we
understand to be revealed by God. And further we profess, that by the virtue
of justifying faith all articles of Christian Religion become, after a sort,
the objects of special faith. For as he who has the Philosophers stone is
said by virtue thereof to turn other metals into Gold: so it may more truly
be said of him who is endued with that faith, whereby we are justified before
God, that he may and ought to make all the Articles of the catholic or
dogmaticall faith, the precious objects of special faith by applying them to
his own good and comfort, which being a matter of singular use and comfort, I
will a little insist upon it. Do thou then believe by a true and a lively
assent, as has been said, that Jesus the Son of the Blessed Virgin is the
erernall Son of God, and the Savior of all those that truly believe in him?
Thou art then bound to believe, that he is thy Savior. Do thou believe
that Christ is thy Savior? then must thou believe that God the Father is thy

God in Christ, that thou have a share in the Communion of Saints, that by
Christ thou have remission of sins, that as when thou die, thou die in

Eternal life.

. VIII. Whereas therefore this question is usually made, whether every man be
bound to believe that he is elected, that he has remission of sins, and that
he shall be saved, and so all the particulars before mentioned, that God the
Father is his Father, etc. I answer, that not every man is bound so to
believe, for then the greater part of men should be bound to believe
untruthes. But this I say, that every man is bound upon pain of damnation to
believe in Christ according to the first degree of faith (for he that believes
not shall be condemned) that is, Ioh 3. 18.
by a true and lively belief or assent to believe, that Jesus is the Savior
of all that truly believe in him; and having this faith, thou art bound to
believe, that he is thy Savior, that he died for thy sins, and rose again
for thy justification, etc. that in Christ thou art elected, that by him thou
have remission of sins, and that through him thou shall be saved. But until
thou have that faith (which is the condition of the promise) thou may not
apply, and by application believe any of these things, unless thou will
beguile thy self. And thus much may suffice for the first point.

. IX. For the second: where Bellarmine proves that a man may Whether a man may
be justified without special faith.
be justified without special faith; it is true in respect of our
justification before God. But they which hold that we cannot be justified
without special faith, speak of justification in the Court of Conscience;
which none can attain unto, unless first they apply the promises of the
Gospel to themselves. Which to do, the Papists hold to be carnal
presumption. Thou may profess thy self to believe that Christ is the
Savior of the world; but if thou be a Papist, thou may not believe that he
is thy Savior, that is to say, that thou shall be saved by him. Thou may
say, he is thy Savior, as the Papists held him to be Savior of all, as well
of those that shall perish, as of them that shall be saved: but if thou shall
not be saved by him, then is he not indeed and in truth thy Savior. Thou
may have a kind of hope, that thou shall be saved, but thou may not
believe it. But that hope will prove a slope, which is not grounded upon faith.
Faith being the foundation of hope, and the substance of things hoped for.
Neither can thou truly hope for the performance of a promise to thee,
unless first by faith thou art persuaded, that it does belong to thee. Thou
may, nay thou must be persuaded that it belongs to thee, if thou have the
condition of the promise, which is to believe in Christ: for in respect of them
that have that condition, the promises of the Gospel are universally to be
understood, and as excluding none that believe. Doft thou therefore truly
believe in Christ, by a true and a lively assent receiving and embracing him as
the Savior? Then may thou apply the promises of the Gospel to thy self,
and by application attain to some assurance of thy justification and
salvation. Yea but, says the Papist, a man cannot be assured by the certainety
of faith that he shall be saved, for many who have thought themselves sure,
have been deceived. But fidei falsum subesse non potest. I answer, that as
there is a knowledge of principles in themselves manifest, and of conclusions,
which are made manifest by discourse, though not absolutely true as principles,
but with presupposall of the premises, they are so true, that it is impossible
the conclusion should be false, where the premises are true: so there is a
faith of principles contained in Gods Word, which is the dogmaticall or
catholic faith, which are absolutely true; and there is a faith of
conclusions, by necessary consequence deducted from those principles, by
application of the general to the particular: which though they be not
absolutely true* yet they are necessarily true; neither can they possibly be
false, the premises being true, and of such conclusions is the special faith.
And so much of the second.

. X. Now for the third, where Bellarmine disputes, that we are not Whether a
man is justified by special faith.
justified by special faith, it is true in respect of justification before
God: but it is false in respect of justification in the Court of Conscience,
without which no man can boldly say that he is justified before God. Of which
justification in the Court of ^onscience, they must be understood to speak,
who unto justification ^equire special faith* by which they are not properly
justified and before God* but assured thereof in their own Conscience. And no
doubt but this is a thing most worthy to be urged and beat upon: as being that
thing which above all other things in this world is to be desired and labored
for according to the ^xhortation of the Apostle Peter 2 Pet. 1. 10.
Give diligence to make your calling and election sure* But this special faith
the Papists above all things derid^ and detes^* ^thereby discovering themselves
to be* as I have elsewhere showed, void of all truth and power of Religion.
It being, as I have said and proved, a thing most profitable, most comfortable,
most necessary: without which no Christian can have any true p^ce or sound
comfor^, or oug^ to have contentment in his present estate, until ^e have
^tained unto it in some measure. And when he (...) attained to some measure,
he must endeavor more and mo^e to increase it. But hereof I have treated in
another place Covenant of Grace.
, wher^unto I refer the Christian Reader.

CAP. VII. Of the acts or effects of faith: and first, whether faith does
justify, or only dispose to justification. Secondly, whether it does justify
formally.
. I.

THe next controversy is concerning that act or effect Whether justifying
faith does only dispose a man to justification.
of justifying faith, in respect whereof it is called justifying faith. Of this
there are three Questions, the first, whether Faith does indeed justify, or
only dispose a man to justification. Secondly, whether it justify formally,
as part of inherent righteousness; or instrumentally, as the hand to receive
Christ, who is our righteous^esse. Thirdly, whether it justify alone. The
assertions of the Papists in the two former questions do not seem to ^ang
well together. For if faith go before justification disposing a man thereto,
how does it justify formally, as part of that righteousness whereby a man is,
as they speak, formally just. And if no dispositions b^e required to
justification, to what purpose do they tell us, that a man must be disposed
and prepared by faith and other virtues. For howsoever in their speculations
they require preparative dispositions to justification; yet in their practice
they seem to require (...). For their justification which is in fact and in
deed, is restrained to their Sacraments, as, namely, to Bap^. And their
Sacraments justify ex (...) (...), and therefore without necessity of any
foregoing dispositions. For if any virtuous or good disposition were required,
then should their Sacraments justify, not ex (...) (...), but ex (...) (...).
Only they require, that he who is by the Sacrament to be justified, do not
(...) (...) ^lis (...), that is, interpose the obstacls of some mortal sin.
And what be these dispositions which must go before justification?

. II. Forsooth, there are seven, which according to the decree Sess. 6. c. 6.
Seven. dispositions required before justification, of which vide infra ca. 10,
11, 12.
of the Council of Trent, Bellarmine reckons, De justif. lib. 1. ca. 13. to
prove, that faith does not justify alone, because the other six also do
dispose men thereunto. The seven are, faith, fear, hope, love, penitencie, a
purpose and desire to receive the Sacrament, a purpose of amendment of life.
All which do but prepare and dispose a man. But it is the Sacrament, as,
namely, of Baptism Conc. Trid. Sess. 6. cap. 7.
, that does actually justify, and without which no man is justified. But I
would gladly know, whether these seven preparatives, be fruits of grace, or
works of nature. Not of grace, for, as they teach, no man has grace before
Justification: What then? they are the fruits of nature helped, I wot not, by
what grace: which if it were true would not only prove the maine assertion of
the Pelagians, Gratiam secundum merita dari, or as in other words it is
expressed in the Council of Sess. 6. ca. 7.
Trent, Secundum propriam cajusque dispositionem and operationem. For though,
according to their doctrine, these preparations are not merits of condignity,
as they say, yet they be of congruity: but also disprove the doctrine of the
Apostle, that we are justified freely by his grace. But this seems to me
absurd, that men should have one justifying faith, and so one hope and one
love, etc. going before justification, and another infused in our
justification: and that by the one justifying faith going before, we should be
prepared to justification; and by the other infused in our justification we
should in part be formally justified. But this is certain, that, that faith,
which in order of time goes before justification, is no true justifying faith.
For that which goes before justification, goes also before regeneration, and
what goes before regeneration, is of nature and not of Grace. But faith in
order of time goes not before justification, though in order of nature it
does; for so soon as a man believes he is justified, as Hierome says In Romans
10. 4.
, Talis est ille qui in Christum credidit, die qua credidit, qualis ille qui
universam legem implevit. Such a one is he that believes in Christ, the very
day that he believes, as he that has fulfilled the whole Law; nor in order
of nature before regeneration; for in our regeneration it is wrought. As
therefore no man has faith who is not regenerated, so no man has faith who is
not thereby justified. The Scripture is plain, that in Christ whosoever
believes (...) is justified, Act. 13. 39. He that believes in Christ is
passed from death to life, Ioh. 5. 24. and 6. 54. which passage from death to
life is justification; whereby, as themselves Conc. Trid. sess. 6. cap. 4.
teach, a man is translated from the state of death and damnation, into a state
of Grace and Salvation. Faith therefore actually justifies, and not disposes
only to justification.

. III. The other question is, whether faith does justify formally, Secondly,
whether faith does justify formally
as they speak, as being a part of inherent righteousness; or instrumentally
only, as the hand to receive Christ, who is our righteousness. The Roman
Catholics hold ^he former; the true Catholics, the latter. But the former I
have sufficiently disproved before, and proved the latter. For if we be not
justified by any grace or righteousness inherent in our selves, or performed
by our selves, which I have before Lib. 4.
by many undeniable arguments demonstrated: then it follows necessarily, that
we are not justified by faith, as it is a gift or grace, an act, or habit, or
quality inherent in us, or performed by us. And if we be justified by the
righteousness of Christ only, which being out of us in him is imputed to
those who receive it by faith, which also before Lib. 4. and 5.
I invincibly proved: then also it follows by necessary consequence, that we
are justified by faith, only as it is the instrument or hand to apprehend or
receive Christ, who is our righteousness. Wherefore where faith is said to
justify, or to be imputed to righteousness, it must of necessity be
understood relatively, and in respect of the object, to which purpose, both
justification, and all other benefits, which we receive by Christ, are
attributed to faith, as I have showed Supr. cap. 4.. 6.
before. Not that faith it self works these things, but because by it we
receive Christ, and with him all his merits and benefits. And for the same
cause the faith of all the faithful, though unequal in degrees, in some
greater, in some less, is (...) a-like precious in the righteousness of God,
and our Savior Jesus Christ, 2 Pet. 1. 1. which is an evidence, that faith
does not justify in respect of its own dignity or worthiness, but in respect
of the object, which it does receive; which being the most perfect
righteousness of Christ, unto which nothing can be added, is one and the same
to all that receive it. Of this see more, lib. 1. cap. 2.. 10.

. IV. Here now the Papists, because we deny faith to justify in The Papists
cavil, that we debate faith.
respect of its own worthiness and merit, take occasion to inveigh Bellar. De
justif. l. 1. c. 12.
against us, as if we made it Titulum sine re, and as it were a matter of
nothing. Which is a malicious, and yet but a frivolous cavil. For first.
Itaque sensum.
in respect of justification; we acknowledge it to be the only instrument or
hand to receive Christ, to be the condition of the Covenant of Grace, to which
the Promises of remission of sins and of Salvation are made, without which
the promises of the Gospel do not appertain unto us, and without which our
blessed Savior does not save us. Secondly, in respect of Sanctification, we
attribute all that and more, which the Papists ascribe unto it in respect of
their imaginary justification. That it is the beginning, the foundation, and
root of all inherent righteousness; the mother of all other sanctifying
Graces, which purifieth the heart, and works by love, without which it is
impossible to please God, without which, whatsoever is done, is sin.

. V. But howsoever here the Papists would seem to plead for faith, yet the
truth is, that, as they have abolished the benefit of justification, as it is
taught in the holy Scriptures, so with it, they have taken away the justifying
faith. For though they retain the name, yet in their doctrine there is no such
thing. For first, to faith they do not ascribe the power to justify, but only
to be a disposition, one among seven, even such a one as servile fear is, of a
man unto inherent righteousness, or to the grace of Sanctification, it self
being not as yet a justifying or sanctifying grace. Secondly, that faith, being
infused, becomes the beginning, and a part of formal inherent
righteousness. But so small a part they assign unto it, that they say, that
the habit of formal righteousness differs not from the habit of charity: so
that in justification it has no use at all, and in sanctification charity is
all in all: which is a manifest evidence, that the Church of Rome is fallen
away from the ancient doctrine of the faith. For both Scriptures and Fathers
every where ascribe justification to faith, and not to Charity: to faith, and
not to works: but the Papists ascribe the first justification to charity,
which they make to be the only formal cause of justification, which, as
themselves teach, is but one; and the second justification they assign to
works.

CHAP. VIII. Whether we be justified by Faith alone: The state of the
Controversy, and some reasons on our part.
. I.

NOw I come to the third question, which is the The state of the Controversy.
principal concerning faith, whether we be justified by faith alone, as we
with all antiquity do hold: or not by faith alone, but also by other habits of
grace, as charity, and the rest, and by the works of grace, which the Papists
hold to concur in us to the act of justification, as the causes thereof. Where
first, we are to explain our assertion; and afterward, both to prove, and to
maintain it. And great reason there is, that we should explain it, because
the Papists most wickedly, against their own knowledge, calumniate our
doctrine in this point. I will therefore explain all the three terms, Fides,
justificat, sola, Faith, does justify, alone: for by Faith we do not
understand, What we mean by faith.
as I have showed before, neither the profession of faith, or faith only
professed, which S. James does deny to justify: nor that faith which is a bare
assent, which is the faith of Papists, and is common to them with the Devils,
and with other hypocrites and wicked men; for such a faith we deny to justify,
either alone, or at all: but a true, lively, and effectual belief in Christ,
being a special apprehension or receiving and embracing of Christ, and of the
promises of the Gospel, joined with application, or at least with a true
desire, will and endeavor thereof. The which faith also we deny to be true, if
in some measure, it do not purify the heart, if it do not work by love, if
it cannot be demonstrated by good works.

. II. Now for the word justify: shall I need to tell you, that by What is
meant by the word justify.
justifying we do not mean sanctifying? And yet such is the blinded malice of
the papists, as that because they wickedly confound justification and
sanctification, which we carefully, according to the Scriptures, distinguish:
they bear the world in hand, that our assertion is this in effect, that faith
alone does sanctify, and that nothing concurreth to sanctification, but faith
only: and consequently, that we teach the people, so they can persuade
themselves, that they have faith, they need not take care either for other
graces or for a godly life. But howsoever we hold, that faith does justify
alone, yet we do not hold that it does sanctify alone: but that our
sanctification is partly habitual, unto which, with faith, concur the habits
of other sanctifying graces, as hope, charity, etc. and partly actual, which
is our new obedience in the practice of good works.

. III. But the word sela alone does most displease the Papists, who Of the
exclusive particle alone.
will needs part stakes with Christ in their justification. This therefore is
to be explaned. And first, when we say, that faith alone does justify, we do
not mean fidem solitariam that faith which is alone, neither do we in
construction join sola with fides the subject, but with justificat the
predicate: meaning, that true faith, though it be not alone, yet it does
justify alone. Even as the eye, though in respect of being, it is not alone,
or if it be, it is not a true and a living, but a dead eye which sees neither
alone nor at all: yet in respect of seeing, unto which no other member does
concur with it, it being the only instrument of that faculty, it is truly
said to see alone: so faith, though in respect of the being thereof it is not
alone, or if it be, it is not a true and lively but a counterfeit and dead
faith: yet in respect of justifying, unto which act no other grace does
concur with it, it being the only instrument of apprehending and receiving
Christ, it is truly said to justify alone: wherefore as the brazen Serpent,
which was a figure of Christ, was life up and set on high in the wilderness,
that whosoever was bitten by the fiery serpents, might, by looking only upon
it, be cured. And although their eye could not properly be said to cure them;
yet because it was the only instrument to apprehend that object, which God had
ordained, as the only remedy to salve them; it is truly said, that by only
looking upon that object they were cured. Even so our Savior Christ was lifted
up upon the Cross (it is his own similitude, Ioh. 3. 14, 15.) that whosoever
being stung by the old serpent does but look upon him with the eye of faith (
Ioh. 6. 40.) may be justified and saved, for although this eye of the of the
soul, which is faith, cannot be said properly to justify them who are
sinners: yet because it is ^he only instrument to apprehend that object, which
God has ordained as the only remedy and propitiation for our sin, it is
truly said, that by believing only in Christ we are Justified.

. IV, Secondly, whereas faith it self does not justify properly, That the
object of faith does justify properly.
but the object which it does apprehend, which is Christ and his
righteousness, our meaning therefore when we say that faith alone does
justify, can be no other but this, that the righteousness of Christ alone,
which is only apprehended by faith, does justify us. And forasmuch as this is
a necessary disjunction, that we are justified either by that righteousness
which is inherent in our selves, or by that which is out of us in Christ (for
by some righteousness we are justified, and a third cannot be named:) it
follows therefore necessarily, that if we be not justified by inherent
righteousness, then by Christ's righteousness alone: because a third
righteousness, by which we should be justified, cannot be named.

. V. Thirdly, where we say, that Christ's righteousness alone, That nothing in
that kind does justify, but the righteousness of Christ, as the matter, and
Faith as the only instrument on our part.
which is apprehended by faith alone, does justify, we do not mean
absolutely that nothing else does justify, but nothing in that kind viz. that
the righteousness of Christ is the only matter of our justification; and faith
the only instrument on our part, by which we are justified. For otherwise, as
has before been showed, we confess that many things else do justify, viz.
God, as the Author and principal efficient of our justification, who
imputethunto us the righteousness of his Son. The holy Ghost also does
justify us by working in us the grace of faith hy which he applies Christ's
righteousness unto us. The Ministers also do justify, as the instruments of
the holy Ghost, both by the ministry of the Gospel, by which faith is begotten
in us, and of the Sacraments, whereby the promises of the Gospel are sealed
unto us. And lastly, good works do justify, as the signs and evidences,
whereby our faith and justification is manifested. But as the matter, nothing
does justify but Christ's righteousness, and as the instrument on our part
nothing but faith. And in this sense we do constantly affirm, that by
Christ's righteousness alone, apprehended by faith alone, we are justified.

. VI. For the demonstration of our assertion, I shall not need to Our prooses.
bring many new proofs, seeing that all those arguments, which before I have
produced, but especially those which concern the matter and form of
justification do invincibly prove that we are justified by the righteousness
of Christ alone, being apprehended by faith alone, and imputed to them that
believe. For if we be justified by the imputed righteousness of Christ alone,
and if in us there be nothing which receives or makes us partakers of
Christ's righteousness, but faith only: then there is nothing in us, by which
we are justified, but only faith. But because the Papists object heresy and
novelty against us in this point; I will, besides some few places of Scripture,
and some other reasons, briefly propounded, produce the testimonies of the
Fathers, and others, who have in all ages lived in the Church before these
times.

. VII. First, therefore, Romans 3. 24. the word gratis freely, being an exclusive
particle, does import, that we are justified by the grace of God and merits of
Christ through faith without righteousness in us; and therefore by faith alone.

Secondly, Gal. 2. 16. We know that by the works of the Law (that is, the
righteousness and obedience prescribed in the Law, in which all inherent
righteousness is fully and perfectly described) a man is not justified (...)
no otherwise but by faith, non nisi per fidem, as Bishop Justinian, In Gal. 2.
16.
or by faith only, as Henry Steven, who well understood the Greek, translateth
it, sed tantum per fidem.

Thirdly, Romans 4. 5. the exclusive is employed. To him that works nor, but
has believed, that is, has only believed in him who justifies sinners, his
faith is imputed unto righteousness, and so the Syriack Paraphrast reads;
but has only believed.

Fourthly. Mar. 5. 36. Luke 8. 50. Only believe.

To this Bellarmine De justif. l 1. cap. 20.
answeareth, That Christ speaks of the miraculous raising of a dead body, and
not of the justification of a sinner, for, as for the obtaining of a miraculous
cure, he confesses, that faith does suffice alone. Thus Bellarmine in that
place, to serve his present tume. But in the seventeenth. Consirmat.
Chapter of the same book, where he would prove, that faith does justify,
not relatively in respect of the Object, but by its own efficacy: he
alleges, that the woman of Mat. 15. 28. Mar. 7. 29.
Canaan procured her daughters health by the efficacy of her faith; and
rejects his own answer in the other place. Neither may it be answered,
says he, that it is one thing to speak of justification, and another of the
curing of a bodily disease. For our Lord by the very same words attributes
Vtramque sanitatem, the health both of the body and the soul to faith. For as
he said to the woman who was a sinner, Luke 7. 50. thy faith has saved thee:
so to the woman which had the bloody issue, Mat. 9. 22. thy faith has saved
thee: and to the blind man whom he restored to sight, Mar. 10. 52. thy faith
has saved thee. And further it is to be thought that our Savior, when he
tells them, whom he cured, that their faith had saved them, that is, himself
Act. 3. 16. his name through faith in his name.
through faith had saved them, looked higher than to the cure of their bodies,
as Mat. 9. 2. son, be of good cheer thy sins are forgiven thee: for sin
being the cause of their maladies, the Lord to cure them took away the cause
thereof, which was the guilt of sin.

. VIII. All those places, which exclude works from justification, Reasons 1.
Romans 8. 28. Gal. 2. 16. Ephesians. 2. 8.
do by necessary consequence teach justification by faith alone. For, that we
are justified by some righteousness, is confessed of all. This righteousness,
is either the righteousness of faith, or of works; that is, either the
righteousness of Christ apprehended by faith; and that is the righteousness
of God, which without the Law is revealed in the Gospel; or that
righteousness, which is inherent in our selves, prescribed in the Law. For
neither can a third righteousness be named, by which we should be justified,
neither can we be justified by both; the holy Ghost perpetually making such an
opposition between them, as that they cannot stand together. If therefore we
be not justified by the righteousness of works prescribed in the Law, as all
inherent righteousness is; then we are justified by the righteousness of
faith alone. Or thus: The righteousness, whereby we are justified, is either
inherent in our selves, and performed by our selves, which the Scriptures call
the righteousness of works; or that, which being out of us, is inherent in
Christ, and by him performed for us, which is the righteousness of faith. A
third cannot be named, and by both we cannot be justified. If therefore we be
not justified by the former, which I have sufficiently, or rather abundantly
proved heretofore: then are we justified by the latter alone. For if of two and
no more but two, you take away one, you leave the other alone. So is it in all
dis-junctions consisting of two opposites sine medio. The one being removed,
the other only remains. The second Reason, containing a threesold argument.


. IX. That, by which alone the promise of justification, by which alone
justification, by which alone Christ himself who is our righteousness is
received, that alone justifies. By faith alone the promise, by it alone
justification, by it alone Christ himself is received. For that is the proper
office of faith. For if faith receive the Promise, and justification, and
Christ himself, which no other grace in us can do, then it is the proper
office of faith. But faith receives the promise wherein justification is
offered, Gal. 3. 22. it receives remission of sins or justification, Act.
10. 43. and 26. 18. and 13. 39. it receives Christ himself Ioh. 1. 12. which
no other grace can do, as it is evident: therefore faith alone does justify.
The third reason, because faith is the condition of the Covenant.


. X. That which is the only condition of the Covenant of Grace, by that alone
we are justified, because to that alone justification is promised.

Faith is the only condition Ioh. 3 16. Act. 10. 43. Gal. 3. 9.
of the Covenant of grace, which is therefore called lex Romans 3. 27.
fidei: therefore by faith alone we are justified.

If against the assumption it be objected, that charity, and obedience, and
other virtues are also required: I answer, that these are not the conditions
of the Covenant, but the things by Covenant promised to them that believe. If
we believe, God has promised to justify us; and being justified, or redeemed,
to sanctify and to save us. See Luke 1. 73, 74, 75. Ier. 31. 33, 34. Heb. 8.
10, 11, 12. Gal. 3. 9. and 14. 22. Charity, obedience, etc. are the conditions
of the Covenant of works, Do this, and thou shall live: but the condition of
the Covenant of grace is, Believe, and thou shall be enabled to walk in the
obedience of the law, thou shall receive the gift of the Spirit, and finally,
thou shall be saved. For being by faith freed from sin, and become Servants
to God, you have your fruit unto holiness, and the end everlasting life, Romans
6. 22.

. XI. The holy Scriptures wheresoever they speak of that by The fourth reason,
because faith only in the question of justification is mentioned in the
Scriptures.
which we are justified, mention nothing in us, but faith; not works, nor
other graces, unless it be to exclude them from the act of justification.
Which is a plain evidence that faith does justify alone. Bellarmine
answers, that it does not follow, that because faith only is mentioned,
therefore it justifies alone. For sometimes, other things, as not only other
virtues, but the Sacraments also are mentioned, which notwithstanding do not
justify alone. Whereunto I answer, first, that, in the point of
justification, faith is mentioned alone, and no other grace with it, even where
the holy Ghost treats ex professo of justification, and of the causes
thereof. Secondly, that to no other grace mentioned, either alone, or with
others, is justification any where ascribed. Neither are the Papists able to
produce any testimony out of the holy Scriptures to prove it. As for those
which Bellarmine De justif. l. 1. c. 20.. Quod attinet.
alleges out of Tit. 3. 5. Ephesians. 5. 26. they are not to the purpose, as
speaking of the outward means; which we deny not to concur with faith. That
out of Luke 7. 47. has already been cleared, L. 6. c. lz. 2, ^.
that love there notes not the cause, but the sign of forgiveness. That out
of Romans 8. 24. shows that in this life we are not saved re, but spe, not in
fruition, but in expectation. Which hope or expectation as it is termed, verse.
23. is no cause, either of justification, or of salvation. Thirdly, that the
justification attributed to Sacraments does not hinder justification by faith
alone. For when we say, that faith does justify alone, we mean, that nothing
in us does concur to the act of justification, as any cause thereof; but
faith only, as has been showed. As for the Sacraments, we acknowledge them
to be external means, and as it were manus offerentis, as faith is manus
recipientis. And that the Sacraments be so far srom hindering justification
by faith alone, as that they do confirm it, as being the seal^s of that
righteousness which is by faith.

CHAP. IX. Testimonies of the Ancient Fathers, and of others in all ages, for
justification by faith alone.
. I.

NOw that this Doctrine is no novelty, but that which in all ages has been the
received Doctrine of the Christian Churches, I will prove by the Testimony of
the Christian Writers in all ages, but chiefly of the ancient Fathers.

I. Justin Martyr, AdDiogNetum.
(...). To see Justin. Martyr. Ann. Dom 160.
God, it is granted men, by faith alone. And by what alone we see God, by that
alone we are justified. Again, Ibid.
what other thing could cover our sins, but his righteousness? In whom could
we being sinners and impious be justified, but in the only Son of God. By
the righteousness therefore of Christ only, which is received and put on by
faith only, are our sins covered. In Christ alone those, that are sinners in
themselves, are justified; therefore not by righteousness inherent, but only
by the righteousness of faith.

II. Irenaeus, whom I find cited and approved by Augustine, Advers. Julian.
lib. 1. c. 2.
Men Irenaeus. An. 180 lib. 4. ca. 5.
can no otherwise be saved from the stroke of the old serpent, but by believing
in Christ: Even as the Israelites, who were bitten by the fiery serpents, could
no otherwise be healed, but by looking on the brazen serpent. Clemens Alex. An.
200.


III. Clemens Alex. Paedag. l. 1. c. 6.
(...). Faith alone is the Catholic salvation of mankind. Again, Stromat. l.
5.
the power of God alone without demonstrations is able to save (...) by faith
alone. Origin. An. 230


IV. Origin more plainly: In Romans 3. l. 3.
The Apostle says that the justification which is by faith alone, is
sufficient: so that a man believing only, is justified, and instanceth in the
examples of the penitent thief, Luke 23. and of the penitent woman, Luke 7.
both which were justified by faith alone. And in that place, as has been
observed by others, Origin uses the exclusive particle sola seven times.
Bellarmine answers, De justif. lib. 1. cap. 25.
that Origin only excludes external works, when power and occasion is
wanting, as in the thief upon the cross. Repl. But it evident, that as S.
Paul, so also Origin speaks of works in general, and that in the penitent
these, and in that penitent woman good works were not wanting. For the thee^e
Luke 23. 40, 41, 42.
repro^eth his fellow, confesses his sin, acknowledges Christ's innocence,
professes Christ in his most despicable e^ate, when his own Disciples ^ed,
prays unto Christ to remember him, when he should come to his Kingdom. The
woman Luke 7. 37.
brought an Alabaster box of ointment, stood behind Christ weeping, washed his
fee^ with her tears, wiped them with the hairs of her head, kissed his feet,
and anointed them with the ointment; by which actions she t^tified her faith
in Christ, her repentance for her ^innes, her love to her Savior, acknowledged
by Christ himself to have been great. Yet not by these good works, but only
by their faith, were those two persons justified. And no marvel. For even
Abraham himself, though he abounded with good works, yet he was not justified
by them, but by faith only. Yea, but says Bellarmine, Origin does not exclude
love and repen^nce. Repl. No m^re do we from the subject, that is, the party
justified, but from the act of justification. For, although they do not
concur with faith to the act of justification, as any cause thereof: yet they
must eoncurre in the subject, that is, the party justified, as necessary
fruits of faith, and unseparable companions of justification. Cyprian. An. 250


V. Cyprian: Ad Quirinum. l. 3. c. 42.
Fidem tantum prodesse, or, as Pamelius will have it, i^ (...), faith only or
wh^lly profitet^.

VI. Eusebius Casariensis. De eccl. Theol. l. 1. ca. 12.
(...), wherefore that faith does suffice us to salvation which makes us to
know God the Father Almighty, and to subscribe or assent that his only
begotten Son is the Savior.

VII. Hilari^: it (...) Hilar. An. 360
the Scribes, that sin should be forgiven by a man (for they saw no more in
Christ but a man) and that to In Mat. can. 8.
be remitted by him, which the law could not release: for faith only
justifies. And again, Can. 21.
Q^ia (...) sola justificat: and yet again, De Trinit. li. 6.
Hac sola fides confess^ Christum Dei filium omnium beatitudin^m gl^riam mer^it
in Petr^. This faith alone confessed, that Christ is the Son of God, obtained
in Peter the glory of all blessedness. To the first B^llarmine answers, that
the particle ( alone) excludes only the law, which (...) has no place in the
other two. But if the law be excluded, which i^ the rule of all inherent
righteousness, it proves justification only by faith. For if men be justified
either by the legal righteousness, or by the Evangelicall, and a third cannot
be named; then it follows, that if men have not, nor can have remission of
sins and justification by the law, that is by inherent righteousness, which
is prescribed in the law; th^n they must have it according to the Gospel, that
is by the righteousness of Christ received by faith only: but the former is
true, Act. 13. 38, 39. therefore the latter. Basil. An. 370.


VIII. S. ^asill: This is perfect Sermon. De humilita^e.
and entire glorying in God, when a m^n being not lifted up for his own^
righteousness, knows indeed himself to want true justice, (...), but to be
justified by faith alon^ in Christ. (...) answers, that Basil excludes only
works done without faith, or the grace* of God. Reply. But Basil mentions
not works going before Grace, but speaks of a man already justified, who
then does entirely glory in God, when being not lifted up with a conceit of
that righteousness which is in himself, but being conscious to himself of
his defectivenesse in respect of inherent righteousness, acknowledges
himself to be justified only by faith in Christ.

IX. Gregory Nazianzene speaking (...). A^brosc. A. 370.
of those words, Romans 10. 9. 10. Greg. Nazianz. A. 370.
(...) for it is righteousness to believe only.

X. Saint Ambrose, or whosoever else (as ancient as he) was the Author of the
Commentaries on the Epistles of Paul, whom the Papists use to cite under the
name of Saint Ambrose, and of Bishop Ambr^se when they meet with any thing that
seems to make for them. Six^us Senensis, B^bliothec lib. 4.
does not only acknowledge them to be Ambrose his Commentaries, but also
commends them, as being breves quidem in verbis, sed sententiarum pondere
graves. He in very many places ascribes justification to faith alone.
^ellarmine says, he excludes the works of the cerem^niall Law, or the
necessity of external works: which may serve perhaps for a poor shift, to
avoid some few places, but not the most.

As first, in Romans 3. 24. They are justified says he, gratis, that is, freely,
because nihil operantes, neque vicem redentes sola fide justificati sunt done
Dei, that is, without works either going before or following after, they are,
through the gift of God, justified by faith only. Secondly, In Romans 4. how can
the Jews, who look to be justified by the works of the Law, think, that
they are justified with the justification of Abraham, cum videant Abraham non
ex operibus legis, sed sola fide justificatum, when they see Abraham to have
been justified, not by the works of the Law, but only by faith. Non erg^
^pus est lege, quando impius per solam fidem justificatur apud Deum. There is
no need therefore of the Law; seeing a sinner is justified before God by faith
alone.

Thirdly, and on those words of the fifth (...) according to the Latin,
secundum propositum (...)] sic dec^etum dicit a Deo ut cessante lege solam
fidem (...) Dei p^sceret ad sal^tem. Fourthly, He pronounces them blessed whom
God has ordained that without any labor or observation sol^ fide
justificantur apud De^; they should be justified before God by faith alone.
Fifthly, There being nothing required of them, but only that they believe.
Sixthly, In Romans 9. Sola fides posita est ad salutem. Seventhly, in Romans 10.
Nullum opus dicit legis, sed solam fidem (...) in causa Chr^sti. Eighthly, In 1
Cor. 1, this is ordained of God that whosoever believes in Christ, be safe or
saved sine oper^ sol^ fide gratis recipiens remissionem peccatorum, without
work receiving freely remission of sins by faith alone. Ninthly, In 2 Cor. 3.
hac lex (scil. spiritus) d^t libertatem, solam fidem poscens, the Law of the
Spirit (which is the covenant of grace) gives ^liberty, requiring faith only.
Tenthly. In Gal. 3. 18. he notes the improvident presumption of the Jews, who
thought that men cannot be justified without the works of the Law cum sciant
Abraham qui forma ejus rei est, sine operibus legis per solam fidem,
justificatum, when themselves know that Abraham who is the pattern or samplar
of that matter, to have been justified by faith alone without the works of the
Law. Eleventhly, In Gal. 3. 22. that he coming who was promised to Abraham
fidem solam ab ijs posceret should require of them faith only. Twelfthly, In
his forty five sermon, which by some is attributed to Maximus who lived after
him forty years; to the penetent thief it suffices ad innocentiam, Domino
credidisse to make him innocent, that he believed in the Lord. De consecrat.
did. 4. c. 99.
Thirteenthly, Another testimony of Ambrose recorded by Gratian: that the grace
of God in baptism requires neither mourning nor any work, sed solam fidem
and omnia gratis condonat, but faith alone and forgiveth all freely.
XI. Hierome, or what other Writer no less ancient, was the Author
Hieronymus* A. 380.
of the commentaries on Paul's Epistles, in very many places teaches
justification by faith alone. Bellarmin^ De scriptorib. in Hieronymo.
says, that Pelagius was the Author of those Commentaries. But this appears
to be false by those places which S. Augustine cites out of the commentaries
of Pelagius in his three first chapters of his third book, De peccatorum
meritis and remissione. I deny not, but that diverse sentences are found in
those Commentaries rankely savouring of the Pelegian heresy, as well as in the
writings of other ancient Fathers, either because before the Pelagian her^sie
was spread, they wrote more caresly of those points; or rather because the
Pelagian heretics did corrupt their writings: which Possevin himself
suspecteth might have happened to this author. These Commentaries do seem to
have been in great account in the Church, above 1100 years ago, in that
Sed^lius in his Collectanea, and sometimes by name Alit^r ut Hieronymus exponi^.
as 1 Cor. 7. 37. And Primasius in his Commentaries on the Epistles were not
ashamed to borrow store of annotations out of these Commentaries, as in other
points, so in this, which I have in hand; as may appear by collation of those,
which I shall cite out of them. The Author of the ordinary gloss, who lived
eight hundred years ago, every where cites them under the name of Hierome. For
my part I suspect, that B^llarmine and other Papists do not so much distaste
this Writer for coming too near the Pelagians, as for his too much departing
from themselves; I mean especially in this question of justification freely by
the grace of God through faith alone in Christ, to which purpose there are more
frequent and more pregnant testimonies in these Commentaries than in any other
work of the like quantity of any ancient writer whatsoever: and although these
Commentaries have been interpolated by the Pelagian heretics, yet those
testimonies which I shall allege for Justification by faith alone, the Papists
themselves will free from suspicion of Pelagianisme. Thus therefore he writes.

First, in To. 1. 16. on those words, Iudaeo etc.] sive quod justum fuerit, ut
quomodo Abraham credens ex Gentib. per solam primum fidem salvatus est, ita
caeteri credentes salvarentur. Sedulius has the same, but leaves out the
word, primum. Secondly, In Romans 4. 3: Tam magna fuit fides Abrahae ut and
pristina^i peccata donarentur, and sola pro omni justitia doceretur accepta.
Thirdly, in Romans 4. 5. Convertentem impium per solam fidem justificat D^us. And
upon those words, which are there sound in the Latin edition, secundum
propositum gratiae Dei. Fourthly, Qui proposuit gratis per solam fidem peccata
dimittere. Fifthly, In Romans 4. 11. Vt omnes qui ex Gentibus credunt filii sint
Abrahae, dum and illis sola fides ad justitiam reputatur. Sixthly, In Romans 5.
1. Ostendit quod fides faciat filios Abrahae, qui ex sola prima fide
justificatus est. Seventhly, In Romans 8. 28. secundum propositum] secundum quod
proposuit sola fide salvare quos praesciverat credituros. Eighthly, In Romans 10.
3. Ignorantes quod Deus ex sola fide justificat, and justos se ex legis
operibus quam non custodiunt esse putantes, noluerunt se remissioni subjicere
peccatorum, ne peccatores fuisse viderentur. Et in Roman. 10. 5. Ninthly, Moses
distinxit in Levitico inter utramque justitiam fidei scillicet atque factorum,
quod altera operibus; altera, sola fidei credulitate accedente fiat. Tenthly,
In Romans 10. 10. Ergo si fides sufficit ad justitiam and confessio ad salutem,
inter Iudaeum and Gentilem credentes nulla discretio est. 11. In 2 Cor. 5. 19.
Non reputans illis delicta ipsorum, hoc est per solam fidem cognoscens, read
ignoscens, or as Primasius, indulgens. 12. In Gal. 1. 12. Neque a me confinxi,
neque ab ullo homine accepi, quod Gentes sola fide salvarentur. 13. In Gal. 2.
14. Non ex operibus legis, sed sola fide sicut Gentes vitam in Christo
invenisse te nosti. 14. In Gal. 2. 17. Si enim Gentes fides sola non salvat,
nec nos: quia ex operibus n^mo justificatur. 15. In Gal. 2. 20. In fide viva
filii Dei] in sola fide, quia nihil debe^ legi antiquae. 16. In Gal. 3. 6.
Abraham credidit Deo, and reputatum est illi adjustitiam] ita and vobis ad
justitiam sola sufficit Fides: unto justice Faith only suffices. 17. In Gal.
3. 11. In lege^ nemo justificatur] quia nemo illam serval (Let the Papists note
that point of Pelagianisme) ideo dictum est, quod sola fide justificandi
essent. 18. In Gal. 3. 14. Vt sola fide Gentes benedicerentur in Christo, sicut
pr^missum fuerat Abrahae. 19. In Gal. 3. 26. Aequaliter and Iudaei and Gentes
per solam fidem filii Dei estis, quia credidistis Christ^. 20. In Ephesians. 2. 8.
Gratia estis salvati per fidem] non meritis prioris vitae, sed sola fide. 21.
In Ephesians. 2. 15. Per solam fidem justificans. 22. In Phil. 3. 9. Non habens meam
justitiam] hoc est, meo labor quae sitam, sed illam quae ex fide, etc.] sed
illam quae a Deo proprie and sola fide collata est Christianis.
XII. Chrysostom, In Romans 1. 17. thou obtainest righteousness, not
Chrysostom. A. 390.
by sweat and labor, but receivest it by gift from above Homil. 2.
(...), bringing one thing only from within, viz. to believe, nothing
therefore in us does concur to the act of justification, but only faith.

Secondly, In Romans 3. 27. Homil. 7.
What is the Law of faith? to save by grace: here he shows the power of God,
that he has not only saved, but also justified, and brought into glorying,
(...) and that, not requiring works, but seeking faith only. Thirdly, In Romans
4. 1. Homil. 8.
(...): it is not possible to be saved otherwise than by faith. Fourthly, In
Romans 8. 24. Homil. 14.
This one gift have we brought to God, (...) to believe him promising things
to come: (...) and by this only way we are saved. Fifthly, In Gal. 3. 6. (...)
faith sufficed Abraham to righteousness. Sixthly, In Gal. 3. 8. They (the
justitiaries) said, he that adhereth to faith alone is accursed, but Paul
shows, (...) that he which adhereth to faith alone is blessed. Seventhly, In
Ephesians. 2. 15. (...) by faith alone he saved. Eighthly, In Col. 1. 27. Homil 5.
For at once to bring men more senseless than stones to the dignity of Angels
simply by bare words (...) and by faith alone, without (...).
all difficulty, it is indeed the glory and riches of the mystery. Ninthly, In
Tit. 1. 13. Homil. 3.
For if thou do give credit to thy faith, why do thou bring in other
things (...) as if faith were not sufficient to justify? Bellarmine by other
things understands the ceremonies of the Law. When Chrysostom indeed
rejects al other things, because faith it self is sufficient to justify.
Tenthly, There is a notable testimony cited by Bishop In Romans 3. 28.
Justinian out of Chrysostom in Psalm. 14. which does not only conclude this
question against the Papists: but also puts a manifest difference betwixt
sanctification, which consists of many virtues, and justification, unto which
faith only is required. Iustitia conflatur ex multis virtutibus and ^na virtus
activa non facit justitia^ quemadmodum nec una tabula perficit navigium, nec
unus lapis domum. Vna sola virtus justificat fides, quae est virtutum
fastigium, Righteousness is compounded of many virtues, and one active virtue
makes not righteousness. Even as one planke does not make a ship nor one
stone an house, only virtue justifies namely faith which is the top of all
virtues. 11. Sermon. de fide and lege naturae. Tom. 6. p. 838.
Without faith no man has a^tained to life, (...), but the thief on the
Cross believing only, was justified and afterward twice he affirms that
(...): faith by it self saved. Bellarmine answers that Chrysostom teaches,
that sometimes faith alone, that is without external works does suffice:
which cannot be applied to the penitent thief, who, as I showed before, wanted
not for the time external works; and yet not by them, but by faith alone he
was justified.
XIII. Hesychius in Leviticum: Lib. 4. ^n c. 14.
Grace is given out of mercy and Hesycbiusa. 400
compassion and is apprehended by faith alone and fide comprehenditur sol^, not
out of works, as the Apostle says, for then grace shall not be grace.

XIV. Augustine. De civit. D.
Nam sine bonorum operum meritis per sidem justificatur August. an. 400.
impius and quidem solam. For without the merits of good works a sinner is
justified, and that by faith alone.

2. Apud Gratianum: Great de poeniten^ia did. c. 14.
this is the faith which works by love, huic duntaxat remissio delictorum
promittitur to this only remission of sins is promised -- cui soli venia
promitoitu:, to which alone par^on is promised, -- qua sola peccata relaxantur
by which alone sins are released. 3 In Psalm. 88. conc. 2. sola fides Christi
mundat. The faith of Christ does cleanse alone. 4. Sermon de tempore 68, Initio.
Abraham believed God, and it was accounted to him for righteousness. Ecce
sine opere justificatur exfide, and quicquid illi legali posset observatione
conferri, totum credulitas sola d^navit. Behold, without works he is justified
by faith, and whatsoever might be conferred upon him by the observation of the
Law, all that faith alone bestowed. 5. In Joan. 8. Tract. 42.
On those words, you hear not, because you are not of God: this was spoken to
them who where not only vicious by sin, but also foreknowne, that they were
not to believe ea fide, qua sola possent a peccatorum obligatione liberari,
with that faith by which alone they might be delivered from the bond of their
sins. 6. Out of his sermons De verbis Domini, this testimony is usually
cited. Medicina animae omnium vulnerum, and una propitiatio pro delict^s
credere in Christum. The medicine for all wounds of the soul and the only
propitiation for all sins, is to believe in Christ. 7. Ad duas Epistolas
Pelag. Lib. 1. cap. 21.
quantaelibet fuisse virtutis ^ntiquos praedices justos, non eos salvos fecit
nisi fides mediatoris. qui in remissionem peccatorum sanguine fudit, Bellarmi^e
answers, that in this place are excluded only Nature and the Law of Moses.
Reply, But the place is plain, that though the virtue of the ancient Fathers
were never so great, yet neither it, nor any thing else could save them, but
only faith in Christ. 8. Lib. 83. quaest. Qu^st. 76.
If any when he has believed, shall presently depart out of this life, the
justification of faith abides with him, neither for his precedent good works,
because not by merit but by grace he came unto it; nor for the subsequent,
because he is not suffered to remain in this life. And therefore, say we, by
faith alone. To this B^llrrmine answers, that Augustine speaks of a lively
faith (as though we spoke of any other) for Augustine there says, that a man
is justified without works, going before faith, but that justifying faith is
such a faith as works by love. Bellarmine then confesses that a lively
faith, which works by love, does justify alone. As for that which is not
lively, nor accompanied with charity; we teach, that it justifies neither
alone, nor at all. Thus has he indevoured in vain to answer some
allegations out of six of the Fathers. The rest, either of the same Authors, or
of others, either before named, or now to be cited, remain unanswered, saving
four others, which because he would have men think we want Testimonies of
Antiquity, he has afforded us out of his own store. Which we will examine
in their due place. And in stead of the first which he cit^th out of XV Cyrill
of Alexandria, in ^oan. l. 10. c. 18.
being to no purpose, Cyrill. Alexandr. An. 430.
and yet falsified by him (for Cyrill does not say, hominem per solam fidem
inhaerere Christo, as Bellarmine cites him) and being also false, in that
sense, for which indeed our prevaricator does allege him, that a man may
abide in Christ by faith, and yet want love and perish: But in stead of this I
will requite him with another of the same Author, in the same Commentaries
upon John, on those words, Ioh. 14. 1. Lib. 9. c. 30.
Ye believe in God, believe also in me, per fidem namque, says he, non aliter
servamur, by faith we are saved, and not otherwise, that is, by faith alone.
XVI. To Cyrill we adjoyne Sedulius in Collectanes.
Sedulius, as being of the same time, as Bellarmine, following Trithemius,
supposes he wrote says Bellarmine an explanation upon all the Epistles of
Saint Paul, taken out of Origin, Ambrose, Hierome, and Augustine, meaning those
Commentaries of Ambrose and Hierome, which before I cited. Whereby it may
appear that those Commentaries in the time of Sedulius were of good esteem:
for out of those very Commentaries of Hierome, he has collected many brief
passages, as in other matters, so in this particular. As Hierome therefore had
said in Romans 1. 16. so says he almost in the same words: justi^ia Dei est, in
Romans i. 17.
quod justum fuerat, ut quomodo Abraham credens ex Gentib. per solam fidem
justificatus est, ita caeteri fidem ejus imitantes salvarentur.

2. In Romans 4. 5. Convertentem impium per solam fidem justificat Deus. And on
those words of the Latin Edition secundum propositam gratiam. that is, says
he, as Hierome had said before, quo gratis proposuit per solam fidem dimittere

which he purposed to save by faith alone those whom he foreknew should believe,

wit, of faith and of works: because the one, by works; the other, sola

being called we came, and when we were come he did not exact of us the purity

forgave our sins accepting of our faith alone. 4. And in the seventh of his

things cannot justify without faith, but that faith alone without the help of

salvation, but without it nothing does suffice.
To the former he answers that Bernard speaks de viva fide of a lively
faith, etc. as though we spoke of any other. If he confess, that a lively
faith does justify alone, it is all that we seek. For as for the dead faith,
we confess, that it justifies neither alone nor at all. And therefore
attribute less unto it, than the Papists themselves.

To the other he answers, that the word solam, excludes only the necessity
of Baptism in the case of necessity. Reply, if sometimes it does suffice alone
to salvation, then much more to justification, and if baptism which is manus
dantis be excluded then by the like reason all other things which are in us
are excluded from the act of justification.

XXXVIII. The judgment of Cardinal Contarenus we heard before, Car.
Contarenus ^n. 1541.
that we are justified by the righteousness of Christ imputed to those that
believe: whereupon it necessarily follows, that in us nothing is required
unto justification before God, but only faith.

Thus in all ages of the Church justification by faith alone was a received
Doctrine, until the accursed Council of Trent which denounces a Sess. 6.
Can. 9.
curse against all those, who shall say, that a man is justified by faith
alone. And yet even since that Council the force of this truth has expressed
from the professed enemies of the Gospel a confession thereof.

Ben. Iustinianus in his paraphrase on Gal. 2. 16. he renders it thus. And
yet we are not ignorant that a man is not justified by the works of the Law,
sed per unum Jesus Christi fidem but by the only faith in Christ and in his
explanation he gives this sense, because we who are by nature Jews cannot be
justified by the Law sed per solam fidem but by faith alone, it follows that
no mortal man can obtain righteousness by the works of the Law, sed sol^m
ex Jesus Christi fide, but only by the faith of Jesus Christ. Yea, Bellarmine
himself, De Sacrament lib. 2. cap. 3. in fine.
says, that to us the merits of Christ are applied by the Sacraments; Hebr^is
per solum fidem, to the Hebrews by faith alone. But the faithful among the
Hebrews were justified no otherwise than Abraham was justified. And as Abraham
Romans 4. 23, 24.
the Father of all the faithful Ambrose in Gal. 3. 18. qui sorma jus rei est.
who was the form, and samplar of this thing was justified, so are we. But
Abraham was justified by faith alone, therefore we also are justified by faith
only.

Neither is the justification by Sacraments repugnant to justification by faith
alone, the meaning of our assertion being this, that in us nothing concurreth
to the act of justification, as any cause thereof, but faith only. For being
justified by faith alone, as Abraham was, the Sacraments are added, as
circumcision was to him, as seals Romans 4. 11
of that righteousness which we have by faith. So that faith only justifies
before God as the hand of the receiver: but the Sacraments serve to justify
the faithful in the court of their Conscience by sealing and assuring unto
them their justification.

CHAP. X. Bellarmines arguments, that faith does not justify alone, first,
because it does not dispose alone to justification, there being seven
dispositions whereof faith is but one, and, namely, the first.
. I.

NOw let us see what arguments Bellarmine does Bellarmine disputes the
question three ways.
bring to prove, that we are not justified by faith alone. Which question, in
his opinion, may be De justis. l. 1. c. 12
disputed three ways, either with relation to the time going before
justification, or to the time of justification, or to the time following our
justification. In respect of the first, the question which he makes is,
whether faith does justify alone by way of disposing unto justification. In
respect of the second, whether faith be the only formal cause of our
justification. In respect of the third, whether for the retaining and
preserving of righteousness good works be not required, but faith only
suffices. The first he disputes De justif. l. 1. c. 12. and in the twelve
chapters following to the end of that book. The second, that faith is not the
only and entire formal cause of justification, he disputes in the second
book. The third he disputes in the fourth book, Chap. 18. and 19. where he
endeavors to prove that good works do justify. But in mine opinion he
should rather have disputed this question, whether faith does justify at all
or not. For whereas they make two justifications, the first habitual; whereby
of a sinner a man is made just: the second actual, whereby a man of just is
made more just; by their doctrine, faith does not justify as a part either of
the one, or the other: but is required as a necessary companion, and as it
were, causa sine qua non, which is no cause. For they make the formal cause of
their first justification, which they say truly is but one, to be charity; and
the meritorious cause of the second to be good works. Only, that charity, and
those good works, must not be without faith. All, which they ascribe to faith,
is, that they make it the beginning of justification and a disposition to it.
Neither do we deny, but that true faith is the beginning and the root of
sanctification, and of all inherent righteousness; insomuch that from it both
charity it self, 1 Timothy 1. 5. and all other both internal graces, and
external obedience do spring: but the act of justification, neither in the
first, nor second do they ascribe to faith. Only unto the first justification
they require it as a preparative disposition for the habit of grace to be
infused, which does not differ from Charity; and when it is infused, to be a
companion thereof. And to the second, as causa sine qua non, without which
works do not justify.

. II. But to come to Bellarmines large discourse: the greatest part Bellarmines
dispute impertinent.
thereof seems to be impertinent, and besides the purpose. But to make all
seem pertinent, he maliciously calumniateth us, as if we held all those
assertions, which he with such eagerness does confute. But if we do hold,
that faith does not justify by way of disposing, either alone, or at all: and
that it is not the formal cause of justification, either alone, as the entire
cause; or at all, as any part thereof: and that it is not a consequent of
justification at all, as works indeed are; to what end does all this dispute
serve? unless it be to make their seduced Catholics, who never are permitted
to read any of our writings, to believe, that he has doughtily confuted us.

. III. And that faith does not justify alone, by way of disposing, he That
faith does not justify alone by way of disposing, Bellarmines proves by five
sorts of arguments.
endeavors to prove by five sorts of arguments. The first, from those seven
dispositions required by the Council of Trent to justification, among which he
reckons faith for one. Whereunto in general I answer, that this whole
discourse, besides that it is impertinent, for we do not hold, as I have
said, that faith does justify by way of disposition, First, from the seven
dispositions, which discourse is idle and impertinent.
either alone or at all: it is also an idle speculation disagreeing from their
practicke theology, and that in two respects. First, to their speculative
justification, they require foregoing preparations and dispositions: but to the
obtaining of justification in deed and in practice, no such things are
required. For, the efficacy of justifying a sinner they ascribe to their
Sacraments, which they say do confer gratiam gratum facientem, that is,
justify, ex opere operato; requiring, as I conceive, no preceding preparation,
or disposition in the party to be justified, so he do not interpose the
obstacle of any mortal sin. For if foregoing dispositions were required
before the Sacraments; then they should not justify, as I have said before, ex
opere operato, but, ex opere operantis. Secondly, they do teach, that in their
first justification, Charity, and with it Faith and Hope are infused, whereby a
man that before was a sinner is made righteous. And that therefore a man is
first justified, when these are infused; and that these are first infused, when
a man is justified: and yet they tell us of a true Faith, true Hope, true Love
going before justification. Which by their doctrine, though they go together,
I mean Faith, Hope, and Charity, accompanied with other good dispositions, are
neither graces nor gifts of grace infused. For before, or without the Sacrament
there is no justification, which they have tied to the Sacrament, and before
justification, as themselves say, there is no grace. For if they were graces
indeed (as no doubt but they are where they are true and go together
accompanied with other good dispositions) then men might be justified before
the receipt of the Sacrament, as Abraham was; and then the Sacrament to men so
qualified, should not conserre grace, but seal it. Thus to mainetaine their
pernicious error concerning the efficacy of the Sacraments justifying ex
opere operato (whereby they have turned religion into an outward formality)
that Faith, that Hope, that Charity which go before the Sacrament, as namely
in Cornelius before his baptism, should be no true graces, because all true
justifying and saving grace is insused in the administration of the Sacrament:
and this infusion of grace is that, which they call justification. By their
doctrine therefore justifying faith is that which in the very act of
justification is infused, and being infused does justify, not by way of
disposing, but formally; it self being informed by Charity. And therefore
according to their own doctrine, that faith which disposes to justification,
is not justifying Faith. And consequently all this discourse concerning six
other preparative dispositions concurring with faith, to prove that we are not
justified by faith alone, is besides the purpose. For that faith, which they
make their first preparative disposition, is not justisying faith; neither does
justify otherwise by Bellarmines own confession, than its next companion,
viz, servile fear, does. But we, when we say, that faith alone does justify,
speak not of a bare and naked assent which is common to the wicked which
cannot justify, either alone, or at all; but of a true, lively, effectual
faith, which works by love: and therefore, I say again, this whole dispute
of the seven dispositions is merely impertinent.

. IV. But some will say, do you require no preparative dispositions
Preparative dispositions to justifying faith.
going before justification? I answer, that in adult is we do: but that no way
hinders the truth of our assertion concerning justification by faith alone:
we do confess, that to the begetting of justifying faith preparative
dispositions are ordinarily required in adultis, in those who be of years,
wrought partly by private education and use of other private means, as
reading, meditation, conference, etc. and partly, by the public ministry
both of the Law and of the Gospel, by which, first, our minds are illuminated
to know God and our selves, and what we shall be in Christ if we believe in
him. Secondly he mollifieth our hearts and humbles our souls ordinarily by
the ministry of the Law and extraordinarily by afflictions, either outward or
inward, which are the terrors of a distressed conscience, by which when the
Word will not serve, the Lord draws men, as it were, with a strong hand: that
being thus humbled we may become fit auditors of the Gospel, In which the
Lord to the humbled and prepared soul reveals his unspeakeable mercies in
Christ, stirs us up, by the ministers of reconciliation, to accept of his
mercy in Christ, entreating and persuading us in the name of God, and in
Christ's stead, that we would be reconciled unto God. The holy Ghost, having
thus knocked at the door of our hearts, at length in his good time he himself
opens our hearts to receive Christ by faith, working in our judgments a
lively assent to the doctrine of salvation by Christ, and by it both an earnest
desire in our hearts, to be made partakers of Christ (which is the desire of
application) and also in our wills a settled resolution to acknowledge him to be
our Savior, and to rest upon him alone for salvation, which is the will and
purpose of application. Having thus received and embraced Christ by a lively
assent or belief, and so having the condition of the promise, which is faith;
in the next place we proceed to actual application by special faith; which
is farther to be confirmed by the Sacraments, which are the seals of that
righteousness which is by faith; and by the practice of piety or leading of a
godly life; whereby we are to make, as our election, and calling, so also our
justification sure unto us.

. V. But come we to his argument drawn from the seven preparative The first
disposition. Faith.
dispositions. And first, for faith, he says, he shall not need to prove, that
it does justify, because we confess it; but that it does not justify alone.
Answ. That justifying says, which is a grace infused in our regeneration, we
deny to justify by way of disposing: that faith, which goes before
regeneration, and is not infused, we deny to justify at all. And such is that
faith whereof he speaks; and therefore he reckons without his host. From
our assertion he should rather have concluded thus. That, which is but a
preparative disposition to justification, does not justify at all: that faith
which goes before regeneration, is but a preparative disposition to
justification, as Bellarmine teaches: therefore that faith, which goes before
regeneration, does not justify at all. Or thus: a preparative disposition to
justification does not justify: but faith, as all confess, does justify:
therefore it is not a preparative disposition to justification. Bellarmines
argument, faith does but begin justification, and therefore does not justify
alone.


. VI. Yea but he will prove by authority of Scriptures, by testimonies of
Fathers, and by reason, that faith does not justify alone, because it is but
the beginning of justification: and therefore other things must accompany and
follow it to perfect our justification. Answ. That it is the beginning of
sanctification, and the root of all sanctifying graces, I have already
confessed. But the concurrence both of other inward graces, and of outward
obedience unto sanctification, does not hinder, but that faith does justify
alone. Neither does faith justify, as the beginning of justification only:
first, because there are no degrees of justification before God; for in the
first act it is perfect: and to that act continued throughout this life, faith,
as I showed before out of diverse of the Fathers suffices. I say, suffices to
justification: and therefore is not the beginning only, but also the
continuance and consummation thereof: for as in the first act it justifies, so
also in the continuance of justification, for by it we Rom 5. 2.
stand, and by it we live Hab. 2. 4. Gal. 2. 20.
, and so long as we have faith, it is imputed unto us for righteousness even
from faith to faith Romans 1. 17.
, as it was to Genesis 15 6.
Abraham, after he had long continued in the faith.

. VII. His first proof is Heb. 11. 6. He that comes to God, His first
testimony, Heb. 11. 6.
must believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek him.
Therefore faith is the first motion of coming to God, which we willingly
confess. But he should have done well, to have told us, what is meant by
coming unto God. For to come unto Christ is to believe in him, Ioh. 6. 35, 37,
44, 65. And if that be the meaning of the holy Ghost in this place, then to
come unto God is to believe in him by special faith, otherwise the Apostle
should enunciate idem per idem. And then the meaning is this, he that would
believe that God is his God, and that he will be gracious unto him, must first
believe that God is, and that he is a rewarder of them that seek him. Or thus,
would thou believe that Christ is thy Savior, then must thou first believe
that he is the Savior of all that truly believe in him. Or, it may be, that
the word come, in this place is to be expounded by the word seeking. He that
will come unto God, that is, he that will seek God, must believe that God is,
and that he is a rewarder of them that seek him. For these words, coming,
returning, seeking, which properly betoken the actions of the body, are by a
Metaphore Esa. 21. 12.
translated to the actions of the soul, whereby is meant, sometimes our
conversion and turning unto God, Deuteronomy. 4. 29. 30. 2 Chronicles. 15. 4. Esa. 9. 13.
Hos. 3. 5. and 5. 15. cum 6. 1. and 7. 10. And if that be the meaning of this
place, then nothing else can be gathered from it; but, that faith is the
beginning of our repentance and turning unto God. Sometimes the whole study of
piety, whereby we endeavor to know God, and to serve him. 1 Chro. 28. 9. If
thou seek him, that is, if thou endeavor to know and to serve him with an
upright heart and with a willing mind, 2 Chronicles. 14. 4. and 15. 12. and 17. 4.
Act. 17. 27. Psalm. 119. 2, 3. whereupon godly and religious men are said to be
seekers of the Lord, Psalm. 22. 26. and 24. 6. and 40. 16. Esa. 51. 1. And thus,
faith is the beginning of all piety and of the true worship of God. Sometimes
it signifies affiance in God, Psalm. 9. 10. Esa. 11. 10. compared with Romans 15.
12. Psalm. 69. 6 And so faith is the cause of affiance: for by faith we have
affiance, Ephesians. 3. 12. Sometimes it signifies invocation and calling upon the
name of God So David sought God, 2 Samuel 12. 16. that is besought him So Esa.
55. 6. Psalm. 34. 4. Matthew. 7. 7, 8. Ier. 29. 12, 13. Zach. 8. 21. 22. 2 Chronicles.
2. 3, 4. and thus faith is the cause of prayer: which if it be effectual, is
called the prayer of faith. Iam. 5. 16. And this is ^ignified in.

. VIII. The next place which Bellarmine alleges, viz. Romans 10. His second
testimony. Romans 10. 13. 14.
13. 14. whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. How
then shall they call upon him in whom they have not believed, and how shall
they believe in him of whom they have not heard, and how should they hear
without a preacher? and how shall they preach except they be sent? Where
Bellarmine observes this order of justification, (he should have said of
salvation.) First, sending of Preachers. Secondly, preaching. Thirdly, faith.
Fourthly, invocations. Fisthly, salvation, that is, says he, justification,
which is, as he says, the healing of the soul from the disease of sin. Of
these, says he, sending and preaching are without us, therefore the first
beginning of justification, within us, is faith, which invocation does follow,
and the rest in their order. I answer, first, that the Apostle sets down
in order the degrees, not of justification, but of salvation. Whereof the
first, after election, is vocation; unto which three of these degrees are
referred. First, sending of Preachers. Secondly, Preaching. Thirdly, hearing,
by which faith comes. The second is justification by faith. Thirdly,
sanctification, whereof one principal duty is mentioned, viz. invocation,
which seems to be put, as sometimes it is, Esa. 56. 7.
for the whole worship of God, or religion, Fourthly, salvation. Secondly, in
reckoning these degrees he omi^teth one, in favor of their implicit faith.
For where the Apostle says, how shall they callupon him, in whom they have not
believed, how shall they believe in him of whom they have not heard, and
consequently by hearing known, this degree he leaves out; which proves, that
men cannot believe in God, who have not heard of him, nor by hearing known
him. Thirdly, his inference is of no force at all, For by this place it is not
proved, that faith is the first beginning of justification: but this is proved,
that as the word begets faith, which does justify, or as the Apostle
speaks in other words, Romans 8. 30, whom the Lord does call, them he does
justify: so faith begets invocation and all other duties of
sanctification, for whom God does justify, he does sanctify. Now
sanctification is the beginning of glorification in this life: for by it the
Lord begins in us a spiritual and eternal life: and as glory is gratia
consummata, so grace is gloria inchoata. So that from this place compared with
Romans 8. 30. and 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13, 14. we may be bold to set dowue the degrees of
salvation in this order, Election, Vocation, Justification, Glorification, and
that either begun in this life, which is sanctification, or consummate in the
life to come, which is our eternal salvation.

. IX. His third testimony, is Ioh. 1. 12. So many as received him, to them he
gave power to be made the sons of God, to them which believe in his name.
Where, says he, Saint John plainly teaches, that these who receive Christ by
faith, are not yet the Sons of God, but may be made the Sons of God, if
they go on further, so that they begin also to hope and to love; for love
properly makes men the Sons of God. Answ. The words are (...) Where
Bellarmine by (...) which the vulgar Latin reads potestatem, understands
possibility, as if he had said, potentiam; and the Verb (...) which is the
aorist, he understands as if it were the future, as if the meaning were,
that those, who receive Christ by faith, are in a good possibility to become
hereafter the Sons of God, if to their faith they shall add hope and love:
for it is love properly, says he and not faith, that makes men Gods children.
But the word (...) never signifies possibility, but as in other places it is
translated power or authority; so here, as also, 1 Cor. 8. 9. and 9. 12. right,
or privilege, or as Iansenius Concord. Evang. cap^.
interprets, authoritatem, dignitat^m, jus. And the word (...) does signify,
not that they may be made hereafter, but that so soon as men believe they are
already the Sons of God: he gave them this right, or privilege, this
prerogative, dignity or pre-eminence, to be the Sons of God. And so
Iansenius; the word (...) may be rendered not only fieri to be made, but also
esse to be, that is now, says he, may be the sense, he gave them that
authority, right, and dignity, ut sint Dei filii: that they are the Sons of
God not only after, but when they do receive him, For of them that receive
Christ, even by the first degree of faith, it is said, that they are borne of
God, 1 Ioh. 5. 1. Whosoever believes, that Jesus is Christ, is borne of God:
he does not say, is in possibility to be hereafter; but he speaks in the
time past, (...) he is already borne of God: and in this very place Ioh. 1.
12, 13. they that believe in Christ (...) are borne of God. For indeed
regeneration in order of nature, though not in time, goes before faith, which
the Spirit, when he does regenerate us, works in us. Iansenius well
observes, that the parts of this text understood according to Bellarmines
sense, cannot well stand together: that those who are said to have received
Christ should have power given them whereby they may be made the Sons of God.
For if they have received him, they are already the Sons of God, and need not
to be made Sons of God. And on the contrary, if they are in possibility to
be made Sons then now they are not, and if they be not Sons, then they have
not yet received him. And further he observes, that of them, who are here said
to have power given them to be the Sons of God, in the next verse it is said,
that they are born of God. Besides, those who have not yet received Christ by
faith, are notwithstanding in possibility to be made the Sons of God, whiles
they are capable of faith, and are in possibility to believe. The place to
which he refers us, is 1 Ioh. 2. 19. Ye know, that he, who works
righteousness, is borne of God: from whence this may be gathered, that working
of righteousness is an evident sign or mark of him that is borne of God: not
that working righteousness is the cause to make a man Gods child, but an
evidence to declare that he is the child of God. For he that is borne of God
commits not sin 1 Ioh. 3. 9. as a servant of sin, Ioh. 8. 34. and hereby
we do know that we are passed from death to life, that is, that we are
justified, because we love the brethren, 1 Ioh. 3. 14. Hereby the sons of
God are manifest and the sons of the Devil; he that works not
righteousness is not of God, nor he that loves not his brother, verse. 10.
Hereby, says our Savior, shall men know you to be my disciples, if you love
one another Ioh. 13. 35. I conclude with Saint Paul, Gal. 3. 26. By faith in
Jesus Christ, (he does not say by love, but by faith;) ye are, (he does not
say, ye may be, but ye are) all, that believe, the Sons of God, upon which
words, as I noted before, Thomas Aquinas observes, Faith alone makes men the
adoptive Sons of God.

. X. To these places of Scripture Bellarmine adds the testimonies of the
Fathers; who, if they speak as Bellarmine cites them, they say nothing but
what we willingly confess; to wit, that faith is, as Clemens Alexandrinus
speaks, Strom. lib. 2.
(...) the first propension or inclination to salvation; that it is, as it
were, the eye of the soul, and the Lamp Catech. 1.
to find the way to salvation, as Cyrill of Jerusalem, that it is the light
of the soul, the door of life, the foundation of salvation, as Homil. 2. de
symb.
E^sebius Emissemus: that it is the beginning of righteousness inherent, as De
fide spe and charit.
Chrysostom, that it is the gate and the way unto life as Lib. 4. in Joan.
cap. 9.
Cyrill of Alexandria that it is the first grace in a Christian, as Ambrose De
sacramentis lib. 1,
that it is the beginning and original of as^iance and access to God, as In
Ephesians. 3.
Jerome, that we are made the sons of Wisdom, the faith August. in Gal. 3.
of the Mediator preparing and working it, that it is first given, De
praedestin. S. c. 7.
and by it the rest, that to a Christian the true beginning De bono persever. c
2.
is to believe in Christ, that by faith we obtain grace, De spiritu and
litera c. 30.
and by grace the health of the soul, that the house of God De verb. Apostoli
sermon. 2.
(whereby is meant the whole economy of our salvation in this life) is founded
on faith, raised by hope, and perfected by charity, as Augustine. That faith is
the foundation of righteousness, Prosper, de vita contempl. l. 3. c. 21.
which no good works precede, and from which all proceed, that it is the
foundation Respons. ad dub. 8. Genesis
of all virtues as Prosper. That if faith be not first begotten in the heart,
the rest cannot be good, as Moral. l. 2. c. 33
Gregory. All this and more we affirm concerning faith, But although many
other graces besides faith are required unto sanctification, as forerunners
fitting us unto salvation: yet none concur with it to the act of
justification. And although it be the beginning of sanctification and of all
other graces: yet it is not only the beginner, but the continuer also of
sanctification, purifying still the heart, and working by love; by which we
stand, by which we live, being by the power 1 Pet. 1. 5.
of God through faith, preserved unto salvation. And although it be termed by
some the beginning (as it is) of inherent righteousness; yet it alone, as I
showed before by diverse testimonies of the Fathers, suffices to justification.
And therefore by it we have not a partial or inchoated, but a perfect and
plenary justification.

. XI. To these testimonies says he, natural reason may be added; and
Bellarmines reasons.
well may he call it natural, for there is little art in it: and although it
be very simple, yet it is double containing two slender proofs. The former,
because faith is the foundation of hope and charity: but neither hope nor
charity is the foundation of faith. For a man may believe that which he
neither hops for, nor loves, but he cannot hope for, or love that, which
he does not believe. And what then? therefore faith is the beginning of other
graces. And what then? therefore it follows, that it does not sanctify
alone, for it is but one among many: but it does not follow, that therefore it
does not justify alone. And where he says that faith is the foundation of
hope, and that a man cannot hope for that which he does not believe; this
overthrows a maine Doctrine of the Church of Rome maintained by Bellarmine,
in other places, that a man may hope well for the remission of his fins, and
for his salvation, but without special revelation he may not believe it. His
second reason has no soundness in it. In bodily diseases, says he, the
beginning of health is, for a man to believe, that he is sick, and to believe
the Physician, that takes upon him to cure him, and yet not that faith alone
is entire health. Where Bellarmine compares justification to health recovered
from sickness to which not justification may be compared, but sanctification.
For the disease of the soul, as well as of the body, is not only a privation
or absence of health, but also an evil disposition or habit: which is cured by
the contrary disposition or habit: for as the whole body of sin is cured in
some measure by the grace of regeneration or sanctification: so the several
members thereof: as infidelity by faith, despair by hope, hatred by charity,
pride by humility, uncleanness by chastity, drunkenness by sobriety, etc.
Secondly, he compares the belief of a sick man believing that the Physician
will cure him, which is no health at all, nor means of health, but in conceit,
for many times it proves otherwise, (the promise of the Physician being
deceiveable and the event uncertain) to the faith of an humbled sinner
grounded on the infallible promises of God, which are always performed, to
them that believe.

CAP. XI. Of Fear, and Hope, being his second and third dispositions,
De iustif. l. 1. c. 13. secunda.
. I.

HIs second disposition is fear: which he proves to dispose unto
justification, and to concur thereuntn in the same manner almost as faith
does. But first this discourse is impertinent. For we deny, and our denial we
have made good, that just^ying faith does not justify by way of disposing. And
therefore if it be proved, that fear does dispose a man to justification: yet
that does not disprove justification by faith alone. For we have confessed,
that ordinarily in adultis there are preparative dispositions going before
faith and justification, whereof fear is one. But these preparatives do not
justify: and therefore, for all them, faith may, and indeed does justify
alone. Secondly, you are to understand, that this fear, which goes before
grace, is no grace: neither is it that sonne-like fear, which is the daughter
of faith and love, but the servile fear as he confesses: which is an effect
and fruit of the Law, working on those who are under the Law, and keeping them
in some order for fear of the whippe. Neither is it properly timor Dei the
fear of God, but metus supplicii; the object whereof or the thing feared is
not God, but punishment: or if it be of God, it is not to fear him, but to be
afraid of him. From which our Savior has redeemed those that believe, that
they may worship God in some measure (...), without this fear. Neither does it
per se, and in its own nature tend to justification, which is the exaltation
Luke 18. 14.
of a sinner, but rather to despair, which is the lowest dejection of a
sinner. Notwithstanding as the Law by working this fear is a Schoolmaster
unto Christ (for when (...) by the paedagogie of the Law have learned to know
their (...) damnable estate in themselves, for fear of damnation they are
forced to seek for salvation out of themselves:) so this fear which in it
self tends to despair, and in it own nature affrighteth men from God (as
we see in the example of our first parents, Genesis 3. 10.) is by God made a
means to draw them unto him. But to say that fear does concur unto
justification in the same manner as faith does, is against reason and against
common sense, unless he speaks only of the legal faith, which as it is
wrought by the Law, so it works fear. For fear drives to the humiliation,
faith tends to the exaltation of the humbled soul, and by it indeed the
soul is exalted. Therefore as humiliation goes before exaltation; so fear
before faith. Again, as fear goes before faith, so sin goes before fear.
For sin makes a man guilty, the Conscience being by the Law convicted of
guilt, terrifieth the soul; the soul terrified, either sinketh in despair,
being left to it self: or prevented by God according to the purpose of his
grace, by which it was elected in Christ, seeks to God, who is found of them
that sought him not. So that by this reason sin it self may be said to be
a necessary forerunner of justification, disposing a man to ^feare, more than
fear does to justification, for that is a cause, this but an occasion.
Bellarmines allegations impertinent.


. II. But as this discourse proving that fear is a disposition to
justification is impertinent; and affirming that fear concurreth to
justification in the same manner that faith does, is false: so are some of his
allegations also impertinent. Because they belong not to this servile fear
which goes before faith and and justification, but to the Sonnelike fear,
which is a fruit both of faith and love and a consequent of justification. As
namely, his first place i^ it were rightly alleged, Eccl. The first. Eccl. 1.
28.
1. 28. he that is without fear cannot be justified or reputed just. For the
fear of God, which the Son of Syrach in that chapter from the tenth verse to
the end does so highly extol, is not this servile fear, but the filial
fear: by which is meant true piety it self, which as he calls it there the
beginning, so also the Eccl. 1. 14. 16, 1^.
Crown and fullness of Wisdom. But the place is not rightly translated in
the Latin, which Bellarmine does follow. For the Greek text is, (...) the
wrathful man cannot be justified, or as some editions do read, (...) unjust
wrath cannot be justified, according to that of S. James, the wrath Iam. 1, 20,
of man does not work the righteousness of God. And that the former part of
the verse speaks of wrath, is proved by the latter, which is the reason of the
former, (...) for the sway of his wrath is his ruin, and by the words going
before: where the fear of the Lord is present, it turns away wrath and
represseth anger.

. III. So his second, Psalm. 111. 10. and third, Prove. 1. 7. where it is said,
that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wisdom, and by Wisdom says
Bellarmine is meant perfect justification, he should say sanctification or
godliness. For as the wicked man is Salomons fool: so the godly man is the
only wise man. And in this sense Moses prays, Psalm. 90. 12. Teach us O Lord
so to number our days that we may apply our hearts to Wisdom, that is, to
true godliness, and to the same purpose Job speaks, c. 28. 28. the fear of
the Lord it self, is Wisdom, and so Eccl. 1. 27. Now in these places the
Hebrew word Reshith which is translated (...) beginning, may fitly, as in many
other places, be translated the head, that is a chief or principal part, or
the top: and the meaning is, that the fear of God is a principal part of
godliness, and as you heard even now, Eccl. 2. 18. the Crown of Wisdom.
Otherwise I cannot conceive how fear, which is a fruit both of faith and of
love, should truly be said to be the beginning of godliness; which by
consent of all is the prerogative of faith. And yet faith it self does not
justify, as it is the beginning of inherent righteousness, and much less
fear which concurreth with it not to justification, but only to
sanctification. Now that servile fear is not meant in these places, it is
evident, not only because such commendations are given unto it, as belong not
to servile fear; but also because they that are endued with this fear are
pronounced blessed, Psalm. 112. 1. and 128. 1. Prove. 28. 14. whereas those who
have the greatest measure of servile fear are accursed; and contrariewise they
are happy who are most freed from it. The blessedness promised to Abraham and
all the faithful in his seed, is by Zachary expounded, Luke 1. 73, 74, 75. to
be this, that being redeemed from the hand of our enemies we should worship
the Lord without fear. And Saint John testifies that there is no fear in
love, but perfect love casts out fear, 1 John 4. 18.

Fourthly, the fear mentioned, Prove. 14. 27. where it is said, The fear of
the Lord is a wellspring of life to avoid the snares of death, is the
sonne-like fear of which Solomon speaks in the words next going before. In
the fear of the Lord Prove. 14. 26.
there is strong confidence. Fifthly, the fear of the Lord mentioned; Eccl. 1.
21. is the son-like fear, which in that Chapter from the tenth verse is highly
commended. Of this fear it is said among other things, that it is gladness,
and a crown of rejoicing, that it makes a merry heart, and gives joy and
gladness, verse 11, 12. which are things repugnant to servile fear.

. IV. But let us see how he proves his unlike likeness, that servile
Bellarmines proofs from Scripture.
fear does in a manner justify as faith does, viz. by Scriptures, by Fathers,
by Reason.

First, because as it is said of faith, Heb. 11. 6. so without fear we cannot
please God. Answ. This is true of the sonne-like fear, which is an unseparable
companion of justification: though Bellarmines allegation of Eccles. 1. 22.
proves it not, as I have showed. But of the servile fear it may be truly
said, that they who please God most, have the least of it. For the greater a
man's love is, the less is his fear, and perfect love expels this fear, 1
John 4. 18. But though without the true fear of God we cannot please him; yet
that does not prove that fear does justify. For the like may be said of the
obedience of the Law, of humility, of charity, of repentance, of perseverance,
Heb. 10. 38. and of the like. Neither does faith justify, because without it
no man can please God, but because by it alone we receive Christ, in whom God
is well pleased and reconciled unto us, that is, because by it alone we are
justified.

Secondly, because as faith is the beginning of justice, so sear is the
beginning of wisdom. Answ. of this comparison neither part is to be
understood of justification, but of sanctification or righteousness inherent.
For as faith is the mother of grace; of all both internal graces and also of
external obedience: so the true sonne-like fear of God is a principal part
of true piety. But what does this make for servile fear, which is found in
them who have no grace?

Thirdly, because as faith does justify by making us seek God and to come
unto him: so also fear. Answ. If by seeking of God be meant the worship of
God: then that which causes it, is the cause of sanctification. But servile
fear in it self serves rather to drive men from God: though in the gracious
dispensation of Gods providence it be made sometimes a means to draw them to
him. And this he proves by Psalm. 78. 34. when he he slew them they sought him;
and Psalm. 83. 16. fill their faces with shame, and they shall seek thy name,
and Ion. 3. 5. from the example of the Ninivit^s. The thing I consesse, that by
servile fear men are often times forced to seek God: how beit that which is
forced, many times is fained: as we see in the example of the Israelites, Psalm.
78. 36. who, though by the judgments of God were brought to make semblance of
repentance; yet they did but dissemble, for their heart was not upright with
God, neither were they steadfast in his covenant, verse. 37. But his proofs I
allow not. For the first place speaks of Gods judgments: the second, of
shame: the third, of the faith of the Ninivites, none of fear.

Fourthly, because as by faith Christ is formed in us, so by fear: the
protasis he proves, because Paul says Gal. 4. 19. my little children of whom
I travel in birth again, until Christ be formed in you. But Christ is not
formed in us by justification, but by regeneration, whereby we are renewed
according to his image: the ap^dosis, because Esaias says, C. 26. 18. according
to the Septuagint, from thy fear we have conceived, and have brought forth the
Spirit of Salvation. But why does he flee from the Latin translation, unto
which he is bound? which makes no mention of fear: but only says, we have
conceived, and have brought forth the Spirit of health as some editions read:
which last words are not read together in the Greek, nor in the true editions
of the Latin, but divided by a note of distinction: peperimus Spiritum:
salutes non fecimns. Thus Bellarmine for his own advantage eiteth the fomer
part out of the Septuagint, and the later out of the vulgar Latin, and that
corrupted, when neither of both agrees with the original. From which, if
Bellarmine would argue, he should make himself very ridiculous. The words are,
we have conceived, we have travailed, we have, as it were, brought forth wind
(so Pagninus, Vatablus, Tremellius, etc.) Salutes non fecimus in terra, no
salvations have we wrought on the earth: which words being a complaint, cannot
import that they had from the fear of God (which is not here mentioned)
brought forth the Spirit of salvation. So far is this place from proving that
Christ by fear is formed in us.

Fifthly, as faith does justify, because the just man shall live by his faith,
Hab. 2. 4. so of fear it is written, that the fear of the Lord is the
fountain of life, Prove. 14. 27. Answ. The former place speaks both of the
life of grace, which is our vivification, and the life of glory to which we
are entitled by faith. The latter, as I have showed, speaks of sonnelike
fear, which, as all other habits of grace, may be called fountains of living
well, which all arise from one common spring, which is faith, and are all not
causes and much less preparations, but fruits of faith and consequents of
justification.

Sixthly, as faith does justify by purging of sins, so fear. Answ. To the
proposition. Faith does justify by absolving from sins, Act. 13. 38. Romans 3.
25. and removing the guilt. And it purges also from the corruptions by
sanctifying and purifying the heart, Act. 15. 9. To the reddiction; that fear
which expels sin Eccles. 1. is as I have showed the fear of sons and
not of slaves: neither does it concur to justification, but to sanctification.

. V. To the testimonies of the Fathers affirming (some of them) His Testimonies
and Reason.
that fear serves to prepare and to dispose men to sanctification; and
likewise to his reason, that it is the nature osfeare to flee from evil, and
to seek remedies whereby evil may be avoided, I willingly subscribe. But
though fear be one means among many to dispose or prepare men for
sanctification, or yet for justification: yet neither it nor any of the rest
does justify, and therefore does not disprove justification by faith alone.
Legal faith working fear is a preparative to the Evangelicall justifying
faith: but is so far it self from justifying, that it pronounces accursed
those that are endued therewith.

. VI. His third disposition is Hope, which he says arises of faith His third
disposition, Hope.
no otherwise than fear does. But yet, by his leave, with this difference:
that servile fear is the fruit of a legal faith, applying the threatenings of
the Law to a man's self: but hope of salvation is the fruit of Evangelicall
faith apprehending the promises of the Gospel, and is therefore called the
hope of the Gospel, Col. 1. 23. Neither can there be any sound hope of
eternal life until a man does truly believe, that the promise of salvation
does belong unto him: and that he cannot believe until he have the condition
of the promise, which is justifying faith: and therefore of necessity
justifying goes before hope. As for that hope which goes before justifying
faith, it is evident that it does not justify; neither is it an habit of grace
infused, but a natural affection, such as is in all men who attempt any thing.
As the Apostle says, 1 Cor. 9. 10.
he that ploweth, ploweth in hope: and he that thresheth, thresheth in hope.
Although therefore this hope do dispose men to justification and
sanctification, as after a sort it does in animating of men to use the means
of grace and salvation, in hope that their labor shall not be in vain: yet
for all this hope which does not justify at all, faith does justify alone.

. VII. But let us examine his proofs, which are a few testimonies Testimonies
of Scripture: The three first.
of Scriptures and Fathers impertinent^y alleged. His first testimony is Prove.
28. 25. qui sperat in Domino sanabitur. The second, Psalm. 37. 40. Salvabit eos
quia speraverunt in eo. The third, Psalm. 91. 14. quoniam in me speravit
liberabo eum. Answ. None of these three places, do speak either of
justification or preparation thereunto: nor of hope otherwise than as it is
included in affiance; which as it has reference to the future time is all one
with hope; nor of hope or affiance as it goes before, but as it follows
justifying faith: what therefore could be more impertinently alleged? The
first Prove. 28. 25.
place according to the original is, but he that trusts in the Lord ((...),)
shall be made fat. The Latin in the next verse Verse. 26. Psalm. 37. 40.
translateth the same words thus, qui confidit, and the Septuagint, (...). The
second, Psalm. 37. 40. the word chasah is translated sometimes Psalm. 2. ult.
confidere, to trust; sometimes, and as I take it in that place only, sperare
to hope in the same sense of affiance: those that thus trust or hope in God he
delivers them from the wicked and saves them. But before they can either be
saved or trust in God, they must be justified by faith. And therefore this hope
or aff^ance is no forerunner of justification, but a follower thereof.

The third, Psalm. 91. 14. the Hebrew chashak, which by some is translated
sperare, by others valde or vehementer amare, amore in aliquem propendere; and
might better have been alleged for love, than for hope, both which are
consequents of justifying faith. The words then are, because he has set his
love upon me, therefore I will deliver him: he does not say, I will justify
him. But let us hear Bellarmines Bellarmine in Psalm. 90. 14.
commenting upon this place: the Hebrew word, says he, does signify to
adhere, to love, to please: therefore not every hope, but that affiance which
proceeds out of a good conscience, and out of Love, and filial adhering to
God, does deliver a man, etc.

. VIII. His fourth testimony, Matthew. 9. 2. confide fili, have a good heart
son (so the Rhemists translate) thy sins are forgiven thee. For our Lord
faith Bellarmine did not as some falsely teach justify the man who had the
palsy, before he said (...), be of good courage my son: but contrariwise as
the Council of Trent (very learnedly) signifies; first, he says be confident
my son: and when he saw him raised up in hope of health, he added, thy
sins remittuntur tibi are forgiven thee. Whereby Bellarmine would signify,
that by this hope or affiance the man was prepared for justification. Answ.
First, the party, and those that brought him had faith as all the three
Evangelists, note Matthew. 9. 2. Mark. 2. 5. Luke 5. 20. and therefore was
justified before God, for if they who brought him had faith, much more he, who
no doubt desired them to bring him, and had already his sins forgiven.
Secondly, the Verb is (...), in the time past, and ought to be translated, not
as Bellarm. reads, remittuntur, are now forgiven or in forgiving, but
remissasunt, they are already forgiven. And by that argument our Savior
puts him in comfort that he should be cured, because his sins which were
the meritorious cause of his sickness were forgiven. By which glad tidings he
would have him to be assured by special says of the remission of his sins,
and in that assurance to be confident. So that although the word (...), be
confident were uttered first; yet the words following contain the cause of
that confidence. And therefore not only remission of sins, but assurance
thereof by special revelation went before his confidence, which therefore
could be no preparative disposition thereunto. And this is usual in such
consolations: first, to bid the party to be confident, or not to fear, and
then to set down the cause thereof, as Genes. 15. 1. Fear not Abraham I am
thy shield and thy exceeding great reward. Esai. 43. 1. Fear not Israel, for I
have redeemed thee. In the same ninth of Matthew, verse 22. Daughter be of good
comfort, thy faith has made thee whole. Luke 1. 30. Fear not Mary, for thou
have found grace or favor with God. Luke 2. 10. Fear not, for behold, I bring
you good tidings of great joy; and so in other places. And these were his
testimonies of Scriptures, in which he has found no relief.

. IX. Let us see what help the Fathers will afford him. No man Testimonies of
Fathers.
says Ambros. de poenit. l. 1. c. 1.
Ambrose, can well repent him of his sins, who does not hope for pardon.
Answ. Hope of pardon is a motive to repentance, and to the use of other good
means, whereby we may through Gods grace attain both to justification and to
sanctification. Howbeit repentance belongs to sanctification, and not to
justification.

De catechiz. rudil. c. 4.
Augustine, whatsoever thou declarest, so declare it, that he to whom thou
speak by hearing may believe, by believing may hope, by hoping may love.
From whence nothing can be gathered, but that as faith, by which we are
justified, comes by the hearing of the word, as the Apostle also Romans 10. 14.
17.
teaches: so from faith proceeds hope, and from both, faith and hope, love.
So that here hope, which is a fruit of justifying faith, and a consequent of
justification, is made a disposition, not to justification, but to love.

De lapsis sermon. 5.
Cyprian, to those, who had fallen in time of persecution, gives this advice*
that they should acknowledge their grievous crime, neither despairing of the
Lords mercy, nor as yet challenging pardon, viz. until they had truly
repented thereof: which was indeed wholesome counsel. For no man can be
assured of the pardon of any crime, until he have truly repented of it: Upon
which words of Cyprian, Bell. larmine though he can gather nothing out of them
for his purpose, but that those who desire pardon must not despair of Gods
mercy: yet as a notable bragger he insulteth over us, as if he had us at some
advantage; when, God knows, he has scarce brought any thing worth the
answering. By which words, says he, our adversaries are plainly refuted, who
begin not to repent before they are fully assured that they are highly in Gods
favor, and are confident, that they are to be ranked with the Cherubin and
Seraphin: which is an impudent and yet a witless slander, as though we were
either so arrogant as the Papists who assume to themselves perfection, which we
do not; or so senseless, that we should teach, that men are tied to begin
their repentance when they have attained to perfection, and not till then. If
it be said, that we make repentance to be the fruit of faith, which we define
to be a full assurance of Gods favor, etc. I answer that that definition
agrees only to special faith. Not that all special faith is a full
assurance, but that every virtue is to be defined according to the perfection
of it, and as it is in it self considered in the abstract. Otherwise we
acknowledge degrees of assurance. And if any of our Divines have held the
special faith to be the only justifying faith, they are to be understood as
speaking of justification in the court of conscience, and as judging them only
to be justified and to have remission of sins, who are in their own
consciences persuaded, and in some measure assured thereof. But besides and
before the special faith, whereby we are justified in our own conscience
applying the promise of the Gospel to our selves, a formal degree of faith is
to be acknowledged being the condition of the Evangelicall promises, by which
we aprehend, receive, and embrace Christ, as has been showed, and by which we
are justified before God. This degree of faith in order of nature goes before
repentance, though in time repentance seems to go before faith, as being
sooner discerned. But in order of nature, as well as of time, repentance goes
before special faith. Because no man can be assured of Gods favor in
remitting his sins, who has not repented thereof.

desire to receive the Sacrament, the purpose of a new life.

does hope for a benefit from another, as namely justificacation from God, he
begins to love him from whom he does expect it. In which words there is
some show, that hope disposes to love; but that love does dispose to
justification, not so much as a show. But that some love goes before
justification, and disposes thereto, he endeavors to prove, which if he
could perform, were to little purpose: ^or so long as this love does not
justify, his assertion does not disprove justification by faith alone, but
indeed he proves it not, though to that purpose he produces, besides four
testimonies of Scripture, the authority of the Council of Aurenge. His first
testimony is a supposititious senrence of His first Testimony Eccles. 2. 10.
juxta lati. nameditionem.
an Apocryphal Book. For neither is the sentence in the original Greek, nor
the Book canonical; neither is the sentence it self to the purpose: Ye that
fear the Lord love him, and your hearts shall be (he does not say, justified,
but) enlightened; that is, as Iansenius expounds, comforted. For they that
fear God and love him are already justified by faith, from which both fear
and love do spring.

. II. His second testimony, Luke 7. 47. Many sins are forgiven her, because
she loved much, therefore love is the cause of forgiveness. I answer by
denying the consequence. For here in the Papists are many times grossly
mistaken: who think, that in every aetiologie, the reason which is rendered is
a cause, so properly called, when as indeed it may be any other argument or
reason, as well as the cause. For (...) the cause in a large sense, does not
only fignifie that which causes the effect, which properly is called the
cause of a thing or action, but also any reason, which proves the thing
propounded, which is a cause (...) not of the action or thing it self, but of
the reasoning or conclusion; or as we use to say, cons^quentiae, non
consequentis, of the consequence not of the consequent. Thus it is called the
fallacy (...) non causa pro causa, when that is brought for any argument which
it is not. So the word (...) which is translated redditio causae is the
rendering of any reason from any argument whatsoever. For in any syllogism, that
which is the medium, though it be the effect of the thing, is the cause of the
conclusion; because it is the reason which proves it, and in this sense 2 Timothy
1. 6. 12. (...) 13. Heb. 2, 11.
(...) for which cause, and wherefore, is all one. Thus the Papists prove
Christ's humiliation to have been the cause of his exaltation, as we heard
before, Lib. 1. Cap. 4.. 11.
because ^he Apostle says, therefore God exalted him etc thus they prove the
works of mercy to be the cause of salvation, because our Saiour says, for I
was hungry, etc: so here, that love is the cause of forgiveness, because it is
said, for she loved much: when indeed our Savior argues not from the cause to
the effect but from the effect to the cause, as is most evident. First, by the
parable of a creditour who having two debtors, whereof the one owed him five
hundred pence, the other fifty, and neither of them having any thing to pay,
he freely forgave them both their debt. Our Savior therefore demanding of the
Pharisee, who had invited him, which of these debtours would love the creditour
most; the Pharisee truly answered, I suppose he, to whom he forgave most:
which answer, approved by our Savior, plainly proves that love was not the
cause of forgiveness, but forgiveness of love, and the forgiveing of more the
cause of greater love, and the forgiveness of less the cause of less love:
and consequently, that the greater love was not the cause of greater
forgiveness, but the effect of it. This parable our Savior applying to the
Pharisee that invited him as the less debtour, and to the woman, which had
been a notorious sinner, as the greater debtor, to both which he had forgiven
their debts, they having nothing to pay, shows, that her grea^er love was an
evidence of her greater debt forgiven. Secondly, by the antithesis in the same
verse, but to whom little is forgiven, he loves but a little. It is therefore
plain that the forgiveness is the cause of love, and the forgiving of more,
of more love, and the forgiving of less, of less love. And as less love is a
token of the less debt forgiven, so greater love of more forgiven: he
speaks therefore of her love, not as the cause going before, but as the
effect following after justification.

. III. And such is Bellarmines argument out of 1 Ioh. 3. 14. we are 1 Ioh. 3.

translated from death to life, that is, we are justified because we love the
brethren, therefore the love of the brethren is the cause of justification. I
deny the consequence: the love of the brethren is not the cause, but the fruit
of our justification, whereby it may be known. And this appears manifestly
out of these words which Bellarmine has fraudulently omitted. Nos scimus quia
translati sumus, etc. we know that we are translated from death to life,
because we love the brethren. Our love then is not the cause of justification,
but a manifest sign and evidence whereby it is known, that we are already
justified: for so he says speaking in the time past, (...) that we are already
passed or translated from death to life. And to the like effect our Savior
speaks Luke 7. 47. as if he had said, hereby it appears, that many sins
are forgiven her because she loved much. But that it was not her love, that
justified her, but her faith, our Savior, who had so highly commended her love
does in express terms testify: thy faith has saved thee, go in peace, upon
which words of our Savior she, who was formerly justified before God by a
true justifying faith, which our Savior professes, and which she testified
by her love and by her repentance, departed home justified in the Court of her
own conscience by special faith, and being justified by faith, had peace with
God.

4. As for his allegation out of Gal. 5. 6, that faith works by love: it has
no color of proof that love disposes unto justification, but rather the
contrary. For he that is endued with faith working by love, is already
justified.

. IV. The Council of Aurenge he alleges against himself. Council.
Arausican. Ca^ult*
For if God do first inspire faith and love (it speaks of those who are
adult^) that we may faithfully require the sacrament of Baptism; then are we
first justified by faith, and afterward receive the sacrament, as Abraham did
circumcision, as the sac^ament and seal^ of justification by faith. And this is
generally to be understood of Sacraments received by them, who are come to
years of discretion; that they must be endued with justifying faith when they
come to receive the Sacraments; otherwise they receive no benefit by them. For
as touching Baptism, our Savior says, he that believes and is baptized
shall be saved; but he that believes not (whether he be baptized, or not
bapti^ed,) he shall be condemned. And as touching the Eucharist, it is
certain, that no man can receive Christ therein without faith: which is both
the hand of the soul to receive him: and as it were the mouth of the soul to
eat his body and to drink his blood. And further, Sacraments are seals
anne^ed to the letters patents of Gods promises in the Gospel, and therefore
confirm or assure nothing, but what is contained in the promise, and upon the
same conditions. The condition is faith.

Object. But you will say, if a man must be justified before he receive the
Sacrament, to what end does he then receive it? Answ. that he who is
justified before God by the former degree of faith, may by special faith,
confirmed by the Sacrament, be justified in his own conscience, that is, that
he may in some measure be assured thereof.

. V. Bellarmine, having produced his own arguments, he comes Bellarmines
answers to our arguments. The first, 1 Ioh. 4. 19.
now to answer such, as he says, are ours. The first, out of 1 Ioh. 4. 19. we
love God, because he first loved us. Now God loves no man actually whom he
does not justify, and reconcile unto himself in Christ; for until then we
are in the state of enemies. Neither does any that is not justified nor
reconciled to God in Christ, love him: or if he do then does he love God
before God loves him. Gods love therefore goes before our justification, and
our justification goes before our love of God. Neither is this only true,
that God loves us before we love him, but before we can love him aright, we
must be persuaded of his love toward us, which persuasion is faith, from
which love proceeds, 1 Timothy 1. 5. Bellarmine answers, that God indeed
loves men first, and by loving them makes them just but by little and little
and by certain means. For whom he loves, he first calls to faith, then
he inspireth into them hope and fear and love inchoated, lastly, he justifies
and infuseth perfect charity. Reply, First, that which he speaks of making
just by little and little may agree to sanctification, but to justification it
agrees not; for thereof there are no degrees. Secondly, It would be known,
whether this beginning of charity, which he says goes before justification,
be the same which in justification is infused, differing only in degree, If it
be not the same, how is it charitas inchoata and if it be not infused, as well
as that in the act of justification, why does he say it is inspired? If it be
the same, then gratia gratum faciens is inspired before regeneration, before
which we are nothing but flesh, and in our flesh there is no good thing. And
by this reason justification shall be nothing else but the perfecting of that
charity which before was begun: neither can a man be truly said to be
justified by charity, who is not endu^d with perfect charity, perfectly and
fully expelling all sin: which in this life is never perfect (much less in
incipients) nor ever does so expel sin, but that always whiles we are in
our mortal bodies sin remains in us. Wherefore the Papists do never
attain to that which they call justification, which indeed is not
justification, but the perfection of sanctification. Or if they say they do
attain unto it, and that they have no sin, they are liars, and there is no
truth in them.

. VI. Our second argument: no man can love God in any acceptable Our second
argument.
measure, unless he have the Spirit of God dwelling in him: for love is a
fruit of the Spirit, Gal. 5. 22. to this purpose he cites for us, Romans 5. 5.
which allegation he cannot answer, because he understands the place of our
love of God, which is shed abroad into our har^s by the holy Ghost. Now no men
have the Spirit of God, but they who are regenerated and justified: for the
Spirit of truth the world cannot receive. Ioh. 14. 27. Bellarmine says, this
is true of perfect love, but imperfect love and inchoated which even now out of
the Counsel of Aureng he confessed to be inspired of the holy Spirit, may be
had without the Spirit; but not without Gods special help. Which words
discover unto us one of the depthes of Satan in the mystery of iniquity. For
the Papists, as they do wonderfully extenuate original sin, so do they use
to magnify the strength of nature corrupted. They do not acknowledge that,
which the Scriptures plainly teach, that by nature Ephesians. 2. 1, 5. Joh. 5. 25.
Col. 2. 13. Romans 8. 6
we are dead in sin: only they say that we are diseased with sin, and
entangled and bound with the chains of sin, so that if we be not helped of
God, we are not able to do that which is good. But if God do afford u^ his
special help, then we can have faith, and fear, and hope, and love, and the
other preparations. And further the privative corruption which they cannot deny
to be in original sin, they confess by the halves, or not so much: for the
privation which is in original sin is not only of the act, which they do
not wholly confess but of the power and the habit it self. So that in us by
nature there is a mere impotencie to that which is spiritually good, in
respect whereof we have lost bonum possibilitatis as Augustine teaches.
Wherefore that we may be enabled to believe, to hope, to love, to fear God,
to purpose amendment of life, etc. it is necessary that we should be not
helped, or loosed, but renewed, regenerated, created a new, and raised from the
grave of sin.

. VII. And here I am to mention two things, both for the comfort Whether the
beginnings of grace be graces
of true though weak Christians, and also for the detestation of popery. These
beginnings of faith, of hope, of love, of amendment of life, the Papists do
not acknowledge to be graces infused, but the fruits of nature assisted with
Gods special help, by which, they being helped of God do prepare and dispose
themselves to the grace of justification, which is given to man according to
their own preparative dispositions. But forasmuch as these beginnings of faith
and other virtues are not the fruits of nature (for in our flesh there is no
good thing, and that which is borne of the flesh is flesh; the very disposition
of our nature being enmity against God) but of the regenerating spirit: the
weak Christians therefore; though the graces of God in them are weak and
small, even as a grain of Mustard Seed: yet if they be true and unfeigned,
they are to be persuaded, that the Lord, who in his children accepts the will
for the deed, will accept of them, as the fruits of his spirit; seeing he
professes, that he will not quench the Mat. 12. 20.
smoking flax, nor break the bruised reed. And surely, if the Spirit of God
be the author of no charity, but that which is perfect, then is he author of
none in this life, wherein we receive but the first Romans 8. 23.
fruits of the Spirit.

2. The Papists do not hold themselves to be justified until perfect charity
be infused into them, by infusion whereof all sin is expelled. So that in
any one of them being justified no sin remains. And therefore whiles sin
remains in them (as it does always even in the best, during this life) they
are not justified. No marvel then that Papists cannot be assured of their
justification, seeing they may be assured that they are never justified
because they never attain to perfect righteousness in this life, and because
sin does always remain in them.

. VIII. Our third argument I propound thus: Our third argument.


None that is a child of wrath and an enemy to God can love
God whiles he continues in that estate.
But until their reconciliation and justification all men are children of
wrath, and enemies to God.

Therefore before reconciliation and justification no man can love God.

Bellarmine answers that a man may love God, though God be angry with him:
which is in respect of Gods children, who are justified and reconciled unto
him; but the question is, whether those that are not yet reconciled and
justified, can love God: we know that Gods anger may stand with
reconciliation. For God is angry with his dearest Children when they sin
Esai. 64. 5. 2 Samuel 11. 27. c. 12. 10, 14.
against him, and in his anger he does also correct them, with whom
notwithstanding he is reconciled for he does correct them in love and for their
good. Gods children therefore may love God, where they know him to be justly
angry with them: but they that are enemies, as all are until they be
reconciled, do not love God: but the very disposition of their corrupt nature
is Romans 8. 7.
enmity against God.

. IX. His fifth disposition is Penitencie, which, as he says, is a sorrow His
fifth disposition, is Petencie.
for sin and a detestation of it: which I deny not, ordinarily to be a
disposition in the children of God to repentance. But this is to be understood
of the godly sorrow which some call contrition, which is not to be found in
natural men, which is a sorrow conceived, not so much for the punishment
deserved, as for the offense of God, whom they have displeased and dishonored
being so gracious a God unto them. This proceeds from faith and from love. Of
this it is said, 2 Cor. 7. 10. that (...) godly sorrow works repentance never
to be repented of. As for that sorrow, which is conceived not for the offense
of God, but for the shame and punishment which follow sin, which some call
attrition, it is of the same nature with servile fear^: which, though in it
own nature it rather drives from God than draws to him, as we see in Mat.
27. 3, 5.
Judas; yet God is pleased sometimes to use it as a means to draw his elect
unto him. But though contrition dispose men to repentance, and attrition be
used sometimes as a preparative to faith, because humiliation is the way to
exaltation: yet neither of both justify: and therefore, for all them, faith
alone does justify.

. X. But let us examine his proofs: wherein, though his premises Bellarmines
proofs.
be very weak, yet his conclusion (as always) is very confident. His proofs
are these, Act. 11. 18. Therefore God has given to the Gentiles penance unto
life. 2 Cor. 7. 10. The sorrow which is according unto God works penance to
salvation that is stable. Ezekiel. 18. 27. when a wicked man shall turn himself
from his wickedness, he shall quicken his soul. What can be more clear? if
penance be given of God unto life, that is, to obtain life, if sorrow for
sin undertaken for God work penance to salvation, if he which does penance
does quicken his own soul: how does faith alone justify, or how does penance
not justify? Answ. When I consider your arguments, I wonder at your
confidence. The word which in the vulgar latin is in the two first places
translated poenitentia, and by the Rhemists penance, in the original is (...),
which is not sorrow for sin, but repentance it self, which imports a change
of a man's mind and disposition, and is not a forerunner, but a consequent of
justification before God: which in the first place is called repentance unto
life, because though it be no cause, but a consequent of justification, yet it
is the way to life, and a necessary forerunner to glorification. The godly
sorrow in the second place is commended as an excellent disposition to the
renewing ofrepentance in the faithful not to be repented of. The third
Bellarmine reads thus: when a wicked man shall turn himself from his
wickedness, he shall make alive his soul, as if a wicked man could either
turn himself from his wickedness, or quicken his own soul, or as if a dead
man could restore himself to life. But then is the wicked turned, when God
does turn him: and then is his soul quickened, when God does quicken him. The
words are, when the wicked turns from his wickedness, he shall preserve his
soul from death; that is, as it is expounded in the next verse, he shall live.
Howsoever, this place speaks not of any foregoing disposition, but of
repentance it self, which in order of nature never goes before justification,
though many times it be discerned before it, as the cause many times is known
by the effect. But not whatsoever is necessary to salvation, does justify. All
the graces of sanctification, and namely repentance, have their necessary use:
But justification is ascribed only to faith, because it is the only
instrument ordained of God to receive Christ, who only is our righteousness.

. XI. His sixth disposition is a purpose and desire to receive the His sixth
disposition, a desire and purpose to receive the Sacrament.
Sacrament: by which, as he conceives, justification is conferd. Answ. If we
did hold with them (as we do not) that the Sacraments do confer grace ex
opere operato, and that without them no man could be justified, and therefore
also that they who would be justified* ought to desire and purpose to be made
pertakers of the Sacrament: yet what would this hinder the justification by
faith alone? which if Bellarmine disprove not, all that he says is
impertinent. How much more, if neither the Sacraments do confer grace
according to the Popish conceit, nor the desire of the Sacrament be a
disposition to justification. All that in this case can truly be said is, that
forasmuch as God in his great mercy has ordained the Sacraments, as effectual
means to confirm our faith, and to seal unto us our justification, that it
is a sign of a profane and unsanctified heart, to neglect or to despise such
holy ordinances of God.

. XII. His seventh disposition, is the purpose of a new life, and of His
seventh disposition a purpose of a new life.
observing all the commandments of God, without which we ought not to be made
pertakers of the Sacraments. Answ. This purpose of a new life, is that which
the Scriptures call (...) repentance; which is a fruit of justifying faith and
a consequent of justification. Seeing therefore those adulti, which come to the
Sacraments, ought to bring with them this purpose; it follows, that they
ought first to be justified before God by faith, as Abraham was, and then to
receive the Sacrament as a seal of that righteousness which is by faith. So
that this purpose; though it be necessary to salvation, yet neither does
justify, nor dispose to justification. The place, which he cites out of
Ezekiel. 18. 31. is an exhortation to both the parts of sanctification, viz.
mortification, in those words, cast from you all your transgressions:
vivification, in those, and make you a new heart and a new spirit. But of
justification he speaks not. Neither are we any where exhorted thereto, or to
the parts thereof, which are not our acts, but the actions of God himself, who
only remitteth our sins and accepts of us as righteous in Christ by
imputation of his righteousness. Thus much of his first principal argument
taken from the seven dispositions.

CHAP. XIII. Bellarmines second principal argument, that faith does not
justify alone, because being severed from Love, etc. it cannot justify.
De justis. lib. 1. cap. 14.
. I.

BELLARMIN^ second principal argument is this: Faith being alone does not
justify, ergo it does not justify alone.
If Faith be severed from Hope and Love and other virtues, without doubt it
cannot justify: therefore faith alone does not justify. Answ. If the meaning
of his consequent be this, therefore that faith which is alone does not
justify: I grant the whole: for though faith do justify alone, yet that,
which is alone, s^vered from Charity and other graces does not justify, as
heretofore has been showed. But though true justifying faith be never alone,
but is always accompanied with other graces, yet it justifies alone: though
it never be without other graces, yet it justifies without them, etc. his
consequence therefore I deny: which he labors to prove thus: If the whole
force of justifying were in faith alone, insomuch that other virtues though
present, confer nothing to justification: then faith might justify as well
in the absence, as in the presence of the rest: but that it cannot do:
therefore the force of justifying is not wholly in faith, but partly in it, and
partly in the rest. Answ. This consequence also I do deny, and do refer you
to the similitude of the eye heretofore propounded, which though it be not
alone, yet does see alone: and though whiles it lives it cannot be severed
from the other parts of the body, yet it sees without them against which
similitude Bellarmine might as well argue after this manner. If the whole force
of seeing were in the eye alone, insomuch that the rest of the members being
present, confer nothing to the act of sight: then the eye might see as well
in the absence as in the presence of the rest. But every body knows the
inconsequence of this proposition. For though to the act of seeing other
members do not concur with the eye, as any causes thereof; yet to the true
being of the eye their presence is necessary, for it cannot be a true living
organicall eye and instrument of sight, that has not union with the other
parts, and is not animated by the same soul. Even so I answer concerning
faith: that although to the act of justifying other graces do not concur
with faith, as any causes thereof: yet to the true being of faith their
presence is necessary. For it cannot be a true lively justifying faith, which
is severed from all other graces of Sanctification, and is not wrought and made
effectual by the Spirit of regeneration.

. II. Now he comes to prove the antecedent of his argument, viz. that
conditional proposition: if faith may be separated from hope and love and the
other virtues, witho^t doubt it cannot justify. But he unskilfully troubles
both himself and his reader with his conditional proposition, which as it is
not fitly made the antecedent of an Enthymeme: so is it not easily concluded.
An Enthymeme is an unperfect Syllogism, which is to be made up or perfected by
adding that part of the Syllogism which is wanting. In this Enthymeme, though
the antecedent be a conditional proposition; yet the proposition or Major of
the Syllogism, which also is conditional, is wanting, and ought thus to be
supplied:

If faith alone does justify, then it may justify being severed from hope and
love and other virtues.

But it cannot justify being severed from hope and love and other virtues:

Therefore faith does not justify alone:

In stead of this simple or categoricall assumption, he assumeth
hypothetically, if faith be severed from hope and love and other virtues then
without doubt it cannot justify.

This assumption he endeavors to prove by three arguments, but to no purpose.
For though w^e do constantly hold, that faith does justify alone: yet we
deny that faith being alone and severed from all other virtues, does justify
either alone or ^t all: and therefore to that faith, which is alone, we
attribute less than the Papists themselves. But he will needs prove it: first,
because faith according to our doctrine does justify relatively, and
consequently faith and justice are relatives: there fore where faith is, there
must needs b^ j^stice (he m^neth justice inherent) for one relative cannot be
witho^t the other. This, says he, o^r adversaries will admit willingly, who
teach that by every sin^ faith is lost.

. III. Answ. We do indeed teach that faith does not justify, Our answer.
as it is an habit or gift inherent in us, or in respect of its own
worthiness, but relatively, or in respect of the object which it does receive.
As the hand which receives the alms, releeveth the poor man in respect of
the alms, which it does receive. And yet I do not conceive that therefore the
hand and the alms be relatives. But we confess, that justifying faith is not
without his object: yet that object, by apprehen^ing whereof it (...) justify
rel^tively, is not righteousness inherent (as here Bellarmine against his own
conscience does suggest) but the righteousness of Christ by which we are
justified: between which, and faith there is such a relation; that as
justifying faith is called the faith of Christ, or faith in Christ, faith in
his blood: so the righteousness of Christ by which we are justified is called
the righteousness of faith. And further I confess, that whosoever is
justified by righteousness imputed, is also in some measure just by
righteousness inherent, though he be not justified before God thereby. But
whereas he says, that we will easily admit this argument, that where faith
is, there is also inherent justice, and consequently that justifying faith
cannot be severed from other virtues, because we teach, that by every sin
faith is lost: I do much marvel at his impudency: for though he and his
consorts do wickedly teach, that by every act of infidelity faith is lost: yet
we are so far from granting, that faith is lost by every sin, that we
confidently hold, that true justifying faith is never totally or finally lost,
by any sin whatsoever that is incident to the faithful and regenerate man.
Some indeed have taught that by heinous offenses, which do vastare
conscientiam, waste the conscience, faith is lost: yet that is far from
saying, it is lost by every sin.

Secondly, again, says he, if faith does justify relatively, then it cannot
be in a man's mind, but justice also must be there, and without love there is
no justice. Answ. Without love there is no justice inherent, but that is not it
to which faith when it justifies has relation, but that which faith having
justified us brings forth in us as a consequent of justification.

Thirdly, moreover, says he, if faith severed from all other virtues do
justify alone, then it may also justify being accompanied with those vices
which are contrary to those virtues. But this cannot be imagined, that a man
should be justified, and yet remain a wicked man. Answ. If by vices he
understand certain vicious dispositions, which though they do not reign in
the faithful, yet remain in them as their infirmities: I confess, that
justifying faith may and does stand with such. But if he mean the contrary
habits of sin, which reign in the hearts of the wicked and impenitent
sinners; I profess, that justifying faith cannot stand with such. For where
these do reign the man is wholly unregenerate: and where regeneration is not,
there faith, which by regeneration is wrought, cannot be. It is therefore
against the nature and being of a true justifying faith, to harbor in a soul
unregenerate.

. IV. To this argument he says we answer, that they assume that Bellarmines
proofs that faith may be alone.
which is impossible, viz. that faith may be alone: which I believe not to have
been the answer of any of our Doctors, for a man arguing (...), may suppose
that which is impossible, and yet the argument be of no less force. But our
assertion that faith cannot be alone, which before I have made good in the
second Chapter of this book, and defended against Bellarmines objections,
Chap. 3. he labors De iustif l. 1. c. 14 sed haec responsio.
here to take away by three reasons: first by cavilling with Luther, and
Calvin. First, In Gal. 2.
Luther says, that faith justifies both before and without Charity. I
rejoyne: it justifies before, because in order of nature it goes before:
without, because, though Charity be present with it, yet it justifies without
it: even as the eye, though the ear be with it, yet sees without it.
Secondly, Antidot. ad conc. trid. sess. 6. can. 28.
Calvin says, that the seed of faith remains in the greatest falls of the
faithful, and therefore without Charity. I rejoyne: Calvin says no more than
S. John does, 1 Ioh. ^ ^*
that the seed of God does always remain in those that are borne of God:
which seed of God is, as well the seed of Charity, as of Faith, and both the
one and the other remain in the greatest falls of Gods children; as we see in
Peter, in whom, though he fell most grievously, in denying and sorswearing his
Lord, yet the seeds, yea the habits of faith and love did remain, as I have
proved De persever. c. 10.. 7.
elsewhere.

Secondly, says he, because our argument assumeth, not that faith may be
alone: but that if faith did justify alone, it would do so though it were
alon^: this reason does not confute our assertion, that faith cannot be alone,
but takes away that answer which he falsely, I think, assigns to us. But
this consequence of his, I have denied and disproved.

His third reason, which is but the second to disprove our assertions, if it
be true, says he, that true faith is never alone, then it is because faith
begets those other graces, even as a good Tree brings forth good fruit.
And if this were so, then faith should go before love and other graces, if not
in time, yet in nature. But faith cannot be conceived to be in nature before
justification, or justice infused, or those graces wherein justification
consists, because these are relatives, as they say, God justifying and faith
receiving justification: for relatives are simulnatura, etc. Answ. The
relatives that we mean, are Christ's righteousness imputed of God, and faith
apprehending, or receiving it, which though they be simul natura in respect of
the one to the other, yet both of them are before the other graces in order of
nature. But if justifying faith be before charity, and there be no
righteousness without charity, then (says he) the same man may be just, and
not just at the same time. Answ. It follows not. For though in order of
nature faith be before love, 1 Timothy 1. 5. yet in time they go together.
Neither is that such an absurdity as he imagines, that the same man, at the
same time, should be a sinner in himself, and righteous in Christ: a sinner
according to the Law, because he has broken it; but righteous according to the
G^spell, because in Christ he has fulfilled the Law. Christ being the end of
the Law Romans 10. 4.
to every one that believes: Insomuch that every one that believes in Christ,
is reputed as if he had fulfilled the Law. Lastly because says he, it is false
which they hold, that faith cannot be severed from Charity and other virtues:
and this he takes upon him to prove in the next De justif. l. 1. cap. 15.
Chapter: unto which I have fully Lib. 6. cap. 2. and 3.
answered in the second question concerning the nature of faith.

CHAP. XIV. Bellarmines third principal argument, from the removal of those
causes which may be given, why faith does justify alone.
De iustif. l. ^. cap. 16.
. I.

HHis third principal argument is taken from the removal Three causes.
of those causes (he means reasons) which may be given why faith alone does
justify. All which, as he says, may be reduced to three heads. The first, is
the authority of Gods word. For if the Scriptures any where expressly say, that
faith alone does justify, it must he believed, though no other cause could be
rendered.

The second is the will of God justifying: namely because it has pleased God
to grant justification upon the only condition of faith.

The third is the nature of faith it self, because it is the proper^y of faith
alone to apprehend justification, and to apply it unto us and to make it ours.
Besides these I have rendered other causes; the chief and principal whereof is
this: because we are justified not by any righteousness inherent in our
selves, but only by the righteousness of Christ which being out of us in him
is imputed only to them that believe, and is received only by faith.

. II. But these three causes or reasons which he mentions, will not The first
cause authority of Scriptures.
easily be removed: the first the authority of the Scriptures, this being the
maine doctrine of the Gospel. Yea, (but says Bellarmine) it is no where said
in express terms that faith alone does justify when we, says he, have
express terms, that a man is justified by works, and not by faith only,
Iam. 2. 24. Answ. To the place in the Epistle of James, I shall answer fully
in his due Lib. 7. c. 8.
place. Only here I say thus much. That Saint Iame^ speaks not of the
justification of a sinner before God, by which he is made or constituted just,
(of which our question is:) but of that, whereby a just man already justified
before God, may be approved declared and known both to himself and others to
be just. And that the Apostle James speaks not, either of works as causes,
but as signs of justification; or of the habit of true faith: but of the
profession of faith, or faith professed only: and concludes, that a man is
justified, that is, known and approved to be just, not only by the profession
of the true faith, but by works also: a godly conversation being, as it were,
the life and soul of the profession, and without which it is dead. But though
in express terms it be not said in so many words and Syllables, that faith
does justify alone: yet this doctrine is by most necessary consequence deduced
from the Scriptures. And what may by necessary consequence be deducted out of
the Scriptures, that is contained in the scriptures, as all confess. Whereunto
may be added, that the Fathers so conceived of the doctrine of the scriptures,
who with one consent, as you have heard Supr. cap. 9.
have taught according to the scriptures, that by faith we are justified alone.
And the Papists must remember, that by oath they are bound to expound the
scriptures according to the consent of the fathers.

. III. Now that this doctrine is contained in the Scriptures, I Our first
argument.
have plentifully proved before, Supr. cap. 8.
and something here shall be added. There are but two righteousnesses only
mentioned in the Scriptures, by which we can be justified, either that which
is prescribed in the Law, which is a righteousness inherent in our selves, and
performed by our selves; or that which is taught in the Gospel, which is the
righteousness of Christ inherent in him and performed for us. The former is
the righteousness of the Law, or of works: the latter, is the righteousness
of faith. A third righteousness by which we should be justified cannot be
named. And between these two there is such an opposition made in the
Scriptures, that if we be justified by the one, we cannot by the other. If
therefore the Scriptures teach that we are justified, by faith and not by
works, it is all one, as if they said, that we are justified by faith alone.
If it be all one to say, by faith and not by the works of the Law, or by
faith alone: then says Bellarmine, I demand, whether Bellarm. object.
all works and every Law be excluded, or not. For if all works be excluded,
then faith it self, which Ioh. 6. 29. is the work of God, and if every Law,
then the Law of faith, and consequently faith it self; and so to be justified
by faith, shall be nothing else, but to be justified without faith. Answ. it is
plain, that by the Law is meant the Law of works, and by the works of the
Law all that obedience which is prescribed in the Law. Now in the Law, which is
the perfect rule of righteousness, all inherent righteousness is prescribed.
Then, says Bellarmine, faith it self and the act of faith is excluded from
the act of justification. I answer, first in this question the Apostle
opposes faith to works, To. 3. 28. and 4. 5
and therefore faith is not included under works. Secondly, faith, as it is
either an habit or an act, and so part of inherent righteousness, does not
justify, but, as has been said, relatively, in respect of the object, which
being received by faith does justify, as it was the br^sen serpent apprehended
by the eye which did heal, and not the eye properly.

. IV. Again the Scriptures teach, that we are justified, gratis gratia Out
second argument.
per sanguinem Christi per fidem. Gratis, that is, freely, without respect of
any good works done by us, no not by the works of righteousness which we
have done, Tit. 3. 5. but by his mere grace and favor when we had deserved
the contrary, through the blood and alone satisfaction of Christ, received
only by faith. To the word gratis, Bellarmine answers, that it excludes our
own merits, (which indeed can be none) but not the free gifts of God, as love,
and penitencie, and the like: for then faith also should be excluded. That
follows not; for when we are justified by faith only, we are justified
gratis: gratis says the Apostle, freely, by his grace through the merits of
Christ by faith bringing only faith to justification as the Fathers have
taught, and that not to be any essential cause of our justification, but
only to be the instrument and hand to receive Christ, who is our righteousness
and therefore it is the condition required on our part in the covenant of grace.
The rest, as love, and hope, and repentance, etc. being not the conditions of
the covenant, but the things by covenant promised to them that believe. Upon
the condition of faith (which is also the free gift of God) the Lord promises
remission of sins and justification, and to those who are redeemed and
justified by faith, he does by oath promise the graces L^. 1. 73, 74, 75. Heb
8. 10. Ier. 31. 33, 34.
of sanctification. So that faith only on our part is required to the act of
justification, besides which we bring nothing else thereunto: but love, and the
rest of the graces, as Augustine says of works, non precedunt justificandum,
sequuntur justificatum, and therefore we are justified by faith alone.

. V. And by this the second head is also proved: namely, that it is the The
second cause, the will of God.
good pleasure of God to grant justification upon the condition of faith alone.
If ye look into all the promises of the Gospel, ye shall find that they
interpose only the condition of faith. See Act. 8. 37. and 10. 43. and 13. 38,
39. To. 4. 5. Gal. 2. 16. and so every where. Before the incarnation of Christ,
it was the good pleasure of God, by faith only to justify the faithful, as
Bellarmine himself has confessed. And does he require any other condition of
us? are not we justified as they were? By his knowledge, that is, by faith in
him, Esa. 53. 11.
my righteous servant shall justify many.

Yea, but the Scriptures (says Bellarmine) much more plainly exact the
condition of Penance, and of the Sacraments to justification, than Bellarmines
objections, that other conditions are required.
of faith, as Ezekiel. 18. 27. The wicked if he repent of his sins shall live.
Luke 13. 4. unless ye repent, ye shall likewise perish. Ioh. 3. 5. unless a
man be borne anew of water and the holy Ghost, he shall not enter into the
Kingdom of God. Answ. Many things are required to salvation, which are not
required to justification: which as they be necessary forerunners of
glorification, so are they the fruits of faith and consequents of justification
viz. repentance and newness of life, which is the thing mentioned in these
places. Again happiness (which consists partly in justification or
remission of sins, which is beatitudo viae and partly in eternal life which
is beatitudo patri^) is oftentimes attributed to those things which are not the
causes of happiness, but the notes and marks of them that be happy. There is
but one happiness properly, and that is to be in Christ, who is eternal Ioh.
5. 12. 20. Ioh. 6. ^7.
life, whom whosoever has, has eternal life. Of this happiness Christ alone
is the foundation and the cause, and faith the instrument of our union and
communion with Christ. All other virtues and graces are but the fruits, and
consequently the signs and marks of faith, or of our being in Christ by
faith. And therefore are not so many beatitudes (though they are blessed that
have them) but so many notes of one and the same happiness. It is true, that
if we be sorry for our sins, because by them we have displeased him who has
been so gracious a God unto us, if we confess them, crave pardon for them, and
forsake them, all which are duties of repentance, the Lord has promised to
forgive them. And yet these are not causes of our justification before God, but
fruits of faith by which we come to be justified in our own conscience. By
faith we obtain remission of sins, and by these duties of repentance which
are the fruits of justifying faith we attain to the assurance of it. That
prayer which so much prevails with God, is the prayer of faith. Romans 10 14.
That repentance which is to life is caused by faith, without which it is
impossible to please God: and therefore the Disciples, when they understood
that the Gentiles were brought to believe in Christ, conclude, that God had
given them repentance unto life, Act. 11. 18. As for the Sacraments: the
justification which is assigned to them, does not hinder justification by faith
only, but serves to seal and to assure it.

. VI. The third cause or reason proving that faith does justify The third
cause because it is the property of faith only to receive Christ.
alone is, because it is the property of faith to apprehend and to apply the
promise of justification to our selves. For the clearing whereof I desire the
reader to call to mind what has been said concerning the two degrees of
justifying faith. For by the former we apprehend, receive and embrace Christ
who is our righteousness offered in the promises of the Gospel to our
justification before God. By the other we apply the promises of the Gospel to
our selves, that we may be justified in our own consciences. Both which
actions of receiving and applying the promises to our ^elves, cannot be
ascribed to any other grace, but are proper to faith only.

To this argument Bellarmine shapeth two answers, the former Bellarmines first
cavil.
whereof is a mere cavil at the word apprehension, which we make proper to
faith: as if by apprehending we did mean the first act of the understanding,
when it conceives the object. But this point I cleared before in the first
question concerning the nature of faith: where I showed, that this apprehension
whereof Bellarmine speaks, goes before all judgment of the mind. And that
the understanding having first conceived and apprehended the object, judges of
it either by withholding the assent, if it be doubtful, which is called
doubting; or by giving assent, either weakly, which is opinion; or firmly
which is knowledge: this firm assent or knowledge is grounded either upon the
evidence of the thing; which is either manifest in it self, and that is (...),
the clear intelligence; or manifested by discourse which is (...), or science:
or else the thing being not evident, either to sense or reason, upon the
infallible authority of God speaking in his word, which is Faith. By this
belief we receive Christ, not only in our judgments by assent; but also, if
this assent be lively and effectual, we receive, embrace and lay hold upon
him, as our Savior, with all our souls: acknowledging him, in our judgments,
in our hearts desiring to be made partakers of him, in our wills resolving to
profess him to be our Savior, and to obey him as our Lord, etc.

. VII. This is the apprehension whereof we speak, and which is What it is to
apprehend Christ.
peculiar to fai^, as it is evident. Be it, says Bellarmine, that
justification after a sort is apprehended by faith. Surely it is not so
apprehended, that indeed it is had, and does inhere: but only that it is in
the mind after the manner of an object apprehended by an action of the
understanding and will, and so says he, love and joy apprehend.

In these things Bellarmine shows himself to be a diviner rather than a
divine: we do not say that in our justification before God, justification is
apprehended by faith, but the righteousness of Christ unto justification. And
that this righteousness of Christ, though not inherent in us, is as truly and
really made ours by imputation; as our sins, though not inherent in him, were
made his, when he truly and really suffered for them. By this hand of faith we
receive Christ, Ioh. 1. 12. by it we receive and embrace the promises, Heb. 11.
16. by it we receive remission of sins, Act. 10. 43. and 26. 18. By this
mouth, as it were, Ioh. 6. 54.
of the soul we eat the body of Christ and drink his blood. That, which he
speaks of justification being in the mind after the manner of an object
apprehended by an action of the understanding and the will; may in some sort be
verified of the apprehension of special faith, applying justification to the
believer. But to say, that after this manner love and joy apprehend it, is
against sense. For faith apprehends it by a persuasion, yea, by a firm
persuasion, upon which follow, love and joy, not apprehending, but loving and
rejoicing at that, which faith does apprehend. But these two are not incident
unto a Papist, who renounceth special faith. For can thou love Christ, and
rejoice in him as thy Savior, if thou be not by special faith persuaded, that
thou shall be saved by him? Seeing then unto our justification before God we
are to receive Christ, as has been said, by a true and lively assent: and
unto justification in the court of our own conscience, by a plerophory or
assured persuasion we are to apply the promises to our selves; which are the
peculiar acts of faith, and cannot be attributed to any other grace: it
follows therefore from the proper nature of faith, that by it alone we are
justified.

. VIII. His second cavil is taken from the Sacraments, which by His second
cavil; from the Sacraments.
our confession, as he says, do apply the promises, and justification it
self to the receiver: therefore says he, faith does not justify alone, after
the manner of an instrument applying. In this argument he greatly pleases
himself, but without cause. For first, when we say, that faith alone does
justify, we mean, that in us nothing concurreth to the act of justification
with faith; but without us, we acknowledge many things to justify. Secondly,
faith justifies alone, ut manus accipientis; the Sacraments, ut manus dantis.
Thirdly, faith, does actually justify before God; the Sacraments do not
justify before God, but serve to seal our justification to our own
consciences, neither do they actually confer grace, but confirm it, as the
seals Romans 4: 11.
of that righteousness which is by faith. When as therefore the terms of
washing, cleansing, sanctifying, saving, are attributed to Sacraments, these
phrases are to be understood Sacramentally. And this is our answer: as for
those, which Bellarmine frames for us, he has good leave to make or to mar
them at his pleasure.

CHAP. XV. Bellarmines fourth principal argument, taken from the manner how
faith does justify: and the fifth from the formal cause of justification.
De iustif. l. 1. cap. 17.
. I IF Faith, says he, does justify, as a cause, as the beginning,
Bellarmines first reason; because faith is a cause.
as the merit of justification, then faith does not justify alone, for love
and penance and other good acts do the like: but the antecedent is true,
therefore the consequent. I deny first the consequence of the proposition and
the proof thereof. For neither love, or penance, nor other good acts, do
either cause, begin, or merit justification. And therefore though faith did
justify, as a cause, as the beginning, as the merit whereby justification is
obtained, it might, for all them, justify alone. This were sufficient to
overthrow his whole Dispute. But all his care is to prove the assumption, which
he endeavors in all the parts thereof. And first, that faith is a cause of
justificatition; which we do not deny: yea, we affirm, that nothing in us
does concur to the act of justification, as a cause thereof, but faith only.
But you will ask, what cause? We say the isntrumental only. If Bellarmine
mean any other cause, as no doubt but he does; he should have done well to
have named it, and to have proved it.

. II. He proves faith to be a cause by the prepositions ex and per, His first
reason that faith is a cause; because the prepositions ex and per are
attributed unto it.
by and through, attributed to faith: whereto I answer, that these particles
sometimes are used to signify the isntrumental cause. As namely, when we are
said to be justified or saved, through or by the word or the Sacraments, Romans
6. 4. Tit. 3. 5. Ioh. 17. 20. 1 Cor. 1. 21. and 15. 2. Faith comes by
hearing, Romans 10. 17. Preachers are Ministers by whom you do believe, 1 Cor.
3. 5. Ephesians. 3. 6. And first for those places wherein it is said, that we are
justified by faith or saved by faith, Romans 3. 28. 30. and 5. 1. Ephesians. 2. 8. In
these and the like places says he, the preposition by or through, does
signify a true cause. But he should have done well to have set down what
cause; for an isntrumental cause is also a true cause. The preposition per,
says De justif. l. 2. c. 3.. deinde praepositio.
B^llarmine in another place, is not fitly accommodated to the favor of God
(which is the efficient cause of justification) but either to the formal as per
gratiam, or meritorious, as permeritum filii, or isntrumental, cause as per
fidem and Sacramenta: where you see, by Bellarmines confession, per is
attributed to faith as to the isntrumental cause. It is also attributed to the
matter and merit, as Romans 5. 10, 19. When as therefore it is also attributed to
faith, it cannot be attributed in the same sense, as to the death and obedience
of Christ in propriety of speech; but of necessity it is to be understood by a
metonymy, faith being put for the object of faith, which is Christ's
righteousness. And this manifestly appears, when justification by the
preposition is attributed both to Christ and to faith, as Romans 3. 24. 25. we
are justified (...) by the redemption which is in Christ, (...) by faith in his
blood, by Christ we have access to God, (...) by faith in him, Ephesians. 3. 12. By
the name of Christ we have remission of sins, by faith in his name Act. 10.
43. and 26. 18. As it is said of the cure of the creeple, Act. 3. 16. that the
name of Christ, by faith in his name had healed him. Thus I have showed before,
that the same benefits of justification and salvation, which properly we
receive from the death and obedience of Christ are attributed to faith, not
properly, but relatively and metonymically. Not that faith it self works
them, but the object, which it, as the instrument, apprehends.

. III. But Bellarmine will prove, that in these, and such like places His first
instance from the contrary.
the prepositions by and through do signify a true cause, first by the
contrary. For when the Apostle, Romans 3. and. 4. Gal. 2. and 3. and elsewhere
does prove, that a man is not justified by works, nor by the Law: without
doubt he excludes the force and efficacy of works and of the Law in
justifying, and not a relative apprehension alone. For no man could doubt, but
that the Law and works did not justify by apprehending righteousness
relatively. And therefore the saying of the Apostle had been very foolish, if
his meaning had been, that justice is apprehended by faith, and not by the Law
or works. Even as a man should speak foolishly, who should say, that the
alms is received by the hand and not by the heel. Neither did they, whom the
Apostle confuteth, look to be justified by their works relatively, but by the
merit of them. And therefore that which the Apostle denies to works, he
ascribes to faith. Answ. This manifestly proves that the question of
justification by faith or by works, is thus to be understood, whether we are
justified by the righteousness of Christ alone apprehended by faith (which is
the righteousness of the Gospel, the righteousness of faith) or by a
righteousness inherent in our selves which is the righteousness of the Law,
or of works. For if the question should be understood of faith it self,
there would be no more opposition between faith and works, than is between
the first and second justification of the Papists which are so far from
opposition, that they are sub-alternall, the one proving the other. For if we
be justified by righteousness inherent, we must be justified both by
habitual and actual righteousness, neither of them alone sufficing in
adultis: and therefore if by the one, then by the other also.

Again, Faith being but one grace among many, cannot as it is an habit
inherent in us, by it own worthiness or merit justify or sanctify alone;
but there must be a concurrence of charity and of other graces, neither can the
habits of grace suffice to the sanctification of one come to years, unless
they bring forth the fruits of obedience: neither are the fruits of obedience
(called good works) of any account before God, unless they proceed from the
inward habits of faith and love. But faith considered relatively, as the
instrument apprehending Christ's righteousness, it self alone suffices to
justification, as the Fathers before have testified. This is the work Joh. 6.
29.
of God, which with God is in stead of all works, that we believe on his
Son. For he that truly believes is reputed as if he had fulfilled the
whole Law, Romans 10. 4.
Christ being the end of the Law for righteousness to every one that
believes, Romans 10. 4. Photius apud Oecumen. in Romans 10 4.
(...), he therefore, says the Apostle, that believes in Christ fulfilleth
the Law, because Christ has fulfilled it for him, Christ's obedience being
imputed to him, and accepted of God in his behalf, as if he had performed the
same in his own person.

. IV. Secondly Bellarmine, by other places where the preposition is used,
indevoureth to prove, that faith is deciphered as a true cause. For if, says
he, in all other places the preposition by or through does signify a cause,
why should it not betoken a cause, when a man is said to be justified by or
through faith? I answer, first, that the preposition is often used to signify
no cause at all, as where it is attributed to ways and means occasions and
times, ways: as (...) Mat. 2. 12. by another way, (...) Mat. 12. 1. through
the corn (...) through dry places verse. 43. so through windows, Genesis 26. 8. 2
Cor. 11. 33. doors, Mat. 7. 13. Ioh. 10. 1. walls as Act. 9. 25. tiles Luke 5.
19. Sea, 1 Cor. 10. 1. afflictions, Act. 14. 22. means, as (...) by word Act.
15. 27. 32. by parable Luke 8. 4. by vision, Act. 18. 9. through a glass 1
Cor. 13. 12. by Epistle, 2 Th^s. 2. 15. by faith and not by sight, 2 Cor. 5. 7.

Occasion, as our corruption by the Law works sin, Romans 7. 5, 13. for so it
is said, verse 8, 11. it took occasion by the Commandment, etc. infirmity
laid upon Lazarus, that by it the Son of God might be glorified. Ioh. 11. 4.

Time, whether all time, as (...). Act. 18. 10. and 2. 25.

Or set times, as three days, Mat. 26. 61. forty days, Act. 1. 3. by night,
Luke 5. 5. Mat. 5. 19.

Secondly, that the preposition is often used to signify the isntrumental
cause: as in that Hebrew phrase, by the hand of his servants, Genesis 32, 16. as
God commanded by the hand of Moses, Exodus 9. 35. and 35. 29. Levit. 8. 36. and
10. 11. and 26. 45. Numb. 4. 37, 45, etc. By the hand of Moses and Aaron. Psalm.
77. 20.

1 Samuel 16. 20. Iesse sent by the hand of his son David.

So God speaks by the hand of his Prophets, 1 Samuel 28. 15. 2 Samuel 12. 25. 2
Chr. 29. 25. By the mouth of his Prophets, Luke 1. 70. So by his Prophets, viz.
as his instruments. Mat. 1. 22. and 2. 15.

Thus God wrought miracles by the hands of Paul. Act. 19. 11. or as himself
speaks. (...) by his ministry, Act. 21. 19. Romans 15. 18. (...) by me.

Thirdly, that faith is no such cause of justification, as is usually meant by
the preposition, joined either with other causes of justification, or with
faith upon other occasions. And first to mention those which Bellarmine says
he will here omit, as that we are justified by Christ, by his blood, by his
death, by his obedience: it may not be thought, that when it is said that we
are justified by or through Christ, and by or through faith: or by or through
the blood, the death, the obedience of Christ and by or through faith: that
faith, though the same preposition be prefixed before it, should signify the
same kind of cause. When the Apostle says Romans 3. 24. that we are justified by
the grace of God; there Bellar. notes the formal cause of our justification,
confounding Gods grace and our charity: freely, that is, says he, by the
bounty of God, noting the efficient by the redemption wrought by Christ Jesus,
which notes the meritorious cause, by faith in his blood: we must needs
conceive that faith is a distinct cause from the rest. For neither is it the
formal, for there is but one, and that one is charity, as they teach; nor the
efficient (...), for that is Gods bounty and justice, nor the (...) or the
meritorious cause, for thath only is the merit of Christ. It remains then,
that it is the isntrumental, which is plainly signified, when it is said,
that we are justified through the redemption or satisfaction of Ghrist, by
faith, or when the preposition is attributed both to Christ and to faith, as I
noted before. 2.

. V. Bellarmine says. that in that place, Romans 3. 24. faith is there noted
What cause Bellarmine makes faith to be.
to be the dispositive cause, which I have already disproved. The truth is,
that for all this flourish which Bellarmine here makes, he makes faith to be
no cause at all of justification; but a remote disposition, which disposes to
justification, no otherwise th^n servile fear does which is far enough from
being a cause of justification. If it be said, that he makes it a part of the
formal cause of justification; I answer, that, according to the Council of
Trent, they constantly hold, Bellarm. de grati^ and lib. arb. l. 1. c. 6.
that there is but one formal cause of justification, and that is charity,
which being lost, justification is lost, though faith remains. The habit of
faith infused ^s indeed a chief part of our sanctification, as a mother grace
and root of the rest; but of justification it is no part, but an instrument.
For justification consists wholly upon imputation of Christ's righteousness
which faith, as the hand does receive.

. VI. For the better understanding the manner how faith does The difference of
the acts of faith justifying and sanctifying.
justify, we are to distinguish the acts of faith both in justifying and
sanctifying. The act of faith in justifying is the elicite and immediate act of
faith, which is credere and credendo Christum recipere and amplecti: to
believe, and by believing to receive and embrace Christ. The acts of faith in
sanctifying and producing moral duties, are immediate acts or imperati, which
faith produces by means of other virtues commanded by faith, such are
sperare, confidere, amare, timere, obedire, pati, etc Of justification the man
endued with faith is not the efficient, but the subject and the patient, who
receiving by faith (which is his only act) the righteousness of Christ, is
thereby justified, God imputing to the believer the righteousness of his
Son: and therefore though to believe be his own act, yet he is not said in
the active to justify himself by faith, but in the passive to be justified
by faith, Romans 3. 24. 28. and 5. 1.

But in the duties of sanctification and in all moral duties, the faithful
man is the efficient of them, and his faith (as it is said of arts and other
habits) is the principium agendi, the principle whereby he works and of them
faith under God is the prime cause, and as some call Arist. Physic. l. 2. c. 3.
that, which is principium agendi, (...) Such actions are the most of those
which Heb. 11. are so highly commended, which though they were the fruits of
justifying faith; yet were the acts of faith, not as it justifies, but as it
sanctifies, fortifieth, or otherwise qualifieth them who are endued with it,
and this efficiencie of faith, in Greek and Latin is oftener signified without
the prepositions, than with, (As Heb. 11.) though the sense be the same. Of
justification therefore faith is but the isntrumental cause, justifying
relatively, that is in respect of the object which it does receive; being the
only instrument to receive that object which alone does justify. But of the
duties of sanctification and other moral actions, such as for the most part
are mentioned, Heb. 11. whereof the faithful man is the efficient; justifying
faith, which purifieth the heart and works by love, and other virtues, as
affiance, etc. is the prime cause, working them not relatively, by apprehending
the object, but effectually producing them as principium agendi, whereby
Bellarmines dispute out of Heb. 11. is confuted. For there it is said, says
he, that by faith the Saints overcame Kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
obtained the promises, stopped the mouths of Lions, etc. Where the particle by
does not signify apprehension, but the true cause. For faith was the cause of
Abels religious offering, of Noah's preparing the Arc, of Abraham's obedience,
etc. All this I confess: but that which he would infer thereupon, that faith
therefore does not justify relatively by way of apprehending the object, I
have already answered, for that which he spoke before of apprehending
relatively, was idle and frivolus.

. VII. The second part of his assumption was, that says is the beginning His
second reason; because faith is the beginning of Justice.
of justice and consequently the inchoated formal cause of justification. So
that now belike the seven dispositions shall be the inchoated forms of
justification, the entire form being but one, viz. charity; and consequently,
the disposing faith, and the disposing fear, and so of the rest, shall be
inchoated charity, which is ridiculous. Bellarmine in this argument as
always, by justification understands sanctification; whereof and of all
inherent righteousness, we acknowledge faith to be the beginning, and
consequently the beginning of that righteousness, by which we are formally
just. But of justification, not the beginning only but the accomplishment and
perfection is to be attributed unto faith because no sooner do we by faith lay
hold upon the righteousness of Christ, which is most perfect, but we are
perfectly justified thereby. And therefore the Fathers, as you heard before, ^
acknowledge faith alone to suffice unto justification. So Origin in Romans 3.
lib. 3. Hierome and Sedulius in Romans 10. 10. and in Gal. 3. 6. Chrysostom. in
Gal. 3. 6. in Tit. 1. 13. Augustine. de tempore Sermon. 68. Chrys^log. ser^. 34.
Primasius in Gal. 2. Oecumen, in Col. 2. Theophylact in Gal. 3. Anselm. in Romans
4. If faith alone suffices unto justification, then does it not only begin,
but also perfect and accomplish it. For Romans 5. 1. Being justified by faith we
have peace with God. But Bellarmine endeavors to prove his assertion, by
authority of Scriptures, and testimonies of Fathers. His first testimony
Bellarmines first proof out of Romans 4. 5.
out of the Scriptures, is Romans 4. 5. to him that believes in him that
justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness: Where says
he, faith it self is counted righteousness: and consequently, faith does not
apprehend the righteousness of Christ, but faith in Christ is it self
justice. And if it be lively and perfected by Charity, it shall be perfect
justice: if not, it shall at the least be unperfect and inchoated justice.
Answ. If the question were concerning the approbation or justification of the
act of faith, or the habit, I would acknowledge that the Lord does accept the
same, though unperfect in it self, as righteous. As the zealous act of Psalm.
106. 30, 31.
Phinehas was counted unto him for righteousness throughout all generations.
But the Apostle speaks of the justification of the person, who cannot by one
habit, and much less by one act of faith be formally just. But forasmuch as by
faith in Christ the believer receives the perfect righteousness of Christ:
this faith, in respect of the object does fully justify the believer; and is
therefore counted to him for righteousness, not that it self is his
righteousness, nor that he is righteous in himself, (who still in himself
remains a sinner) but in Christ. And such was the faith of Abraham, and of
all the faithful, that, not in themselves, but in the promised seed, all that
believe in him should be blessed, that is, justified. The Greek word used
sometimes by the Septuagint, as Genesis 18. 18. and 28. 14. and retained by the
Apostle, Gal. 3. 8. is very significant, viz. (...), to signify, that not in
themselves, but in the promised seed they should be justified and blessed, for
so the Apostle, Romans 4. 5, 6, 7. uses these words promiscuously, as also Gal.
3. 8. The Scripture foreseeing, that God would justify the heathen through
faith, preached before the Gospel unto Abraham: saying, in thee (that is in
thy seed) shall all nations be blessed. This blessedness therefore, this
justification is obtained by faith: and therefore is faith counted
righteousness, because it receives it. As for faith it self, absolutely
considered without relation to its object, we, according to the Popish
doctrine, are justified by it neither in the act of justification, nor before.
Not before, for until it be, as they speak, formed with Charity it cannot
justify: nor in the act, for charity alone is the formal cause of
justification, and then only are we formally justified when Charity is infused;
or else there are more formal causes of justification than one: which
Bellarmine according to the doctrine of the Council of Trent, does utterly
deny.

. VIII. His second testimony, 1 Corinthians. 3. 11. another His second proof
out of 1 Cor. 3. 11.
foundation can no man lay, besides that which is laid, which is Christ Jesus.
By foundation, says he, Augustine and other interpreters understand faith in
CHRIST. But Paul himself (say I) in express terms says, that this
foundation is Christ himself; who most properly is called the foundation of
his Church. If therefore says be but the beginning and a part of
justification, because in Bellarmines conceit it is called the foundation; then
Christ himself the author and finisher of our faith, and our perfect Savior,
who most properly is the foundation, Esai 28. 16. Ephesians. 2. 20.
shall afford us but a beginning and a part of our justification. But be it
that faith is called the foundation: yet I would rather think, that it is
called the foundation relatively, because Christ, whom it apprehends, is the
foundation, than that Christ should be called the foundation, because faith
is. Sometimes faith is put for the object of it, and so is hope: and thus some
understand, Gal. 3. 23, 25. But that Christ should be put for faith, I suppose
is not usual. But whereof is it the foundation? it is the foundation, the
beginning, the root, the fountain of Sanctification, and of all inherent
righteousness: yet of justification it is not, but Christ only, who alone is
the foundation of all our happiness. Augustine indeed by foundation
understands De fide and operibus c. 16.
not only Christ himself, but faith also working by love; which as Bellarmine
said in the last argument, is not (as here he speaks) the beginning, but the
perfection of justice. Chrysostom and Theophylact, whom he quoteth speak not
of faith but of Christ only. Howbeit if faith must be held to be this
foundation, I doubt not, but that according to the Scriptures, Heb. 6. 1.
we are to understand the doctrine of faith concerning Christ, which often
times is called faith, which foundation the Apostle laid, when he preached the
Gospel, and whereupon other preachers are to build. This argument therefore
was far fetched, and cannot be brought to conclude the point. The foundation
is Christ, and not faith. Or if faith, then either the habit of faith working
by love, which is not the beginning or foundation of justification, but of
sanctification: or the doctrine of faith, of which the question is not
understood.

. IX. His third testimony is Act. 15. 9. purifying their hearts by faith: His
third testimony, Act. 15. 9.
which plainly speaks not of justification, but of sanctification. For we
having received Christ by faith, he dwells in our hearts by faith and by his
Spirit, applying unto us not only the merit of Christ his death and
resurrection to our justification; but also the virtue and efficacy of his
death to mortify sin in us, and of his resurrection to raise us to newness
of life.

The testimonies of the Fathers serve all to prove, that says is the
foundation and beginning of a godly life, which because we do freely confess
he might have forborne to prove.

. X. The third part of his assumption was, that faith does obtain His third
reason because faith does obtain, and after a sort merit justification.
remission of sins, and after a sort merit justification, and therefore
justifies not by receiving and apprehending the promise. Answ. In the
antecedent of this reason Bellarmine contradicts the Council of Sess. 6.
cap. 8.
Trent which has decreed, nihil eorum quae justificationem precedunt, sive
fides, sive opera ipsam justificationis gratiam promeretur. None of those
things which go before justification, whether faith, or works, do merit the
grace of justification. But here Bellarmine ought to have proved three things,
which because he could not prove, he takes for granted. The first is, that by
other things, besides faith, we do merit justification: which notwithstanding
God does grant us gratis, that is freely, and without merit. For if faith did
merit it, which nothing else in us can do, it would follow, that faith does
justify alon^. The second, that faith does not obtain remission of sins by
receiving and apprehending the object which is Christ. But the Scriptures say
plainly, Act. 10 43 Act. 13. 38, 39.
that by believing in Christ, that is by receiving of him, we receive remission
of sin. The third, that impetrare est quodammodo mereri, to impetrate, is
after a sort to merit: for then, what by faithful prayer we beg of God, we
should be said to merit: and in like manner the beggar, should by begging merit
his alms. But what says Bellarmine elsewhere? De bo^is open (...) (...) l. ^.
c. 9. sciendum.
Multum inte^esse inter meritum and impetrationem, that there is great
difference between merit and impetration: and 1. ^. 2. ae. q. 114. art. 9.
Thomas, Impetramus ea qu^ non meremur. Meritum nititur justitia Dei,
impetratio benignitate; we impetrate those things which we do not merit.
Merit relieth upon Gods justice; Impetration on his bounty. But let us examine
his proofs.

. XI. The first, out of Luke 7. 50. where our Savior tells the His first
proof Luke 7. 50.
Woman, to whom he had said, thy sins are forgiven thee, that her faith had
saved her: for says he, it could not well be said, that her faith had saved her
from her sins, that is, justified her, if it conduced no more to
justification, than only to receive the pardon. For who would say to a poor
man, who only put forth his hand to receive the alms, thine hand has
releeved thee: or to a sick man, who received a medicine with his hand, thy
hand has cured thee. Answ. Bellarmine before, Chap. 13. alleged this place to
prove, that the great love of this Woman toward Christ had procured the
remission of sins, which, if it had been true, would have proved, that not
her faith, but her love had saved her. Secondly, when our Savior says, thy
faith, namely in me, has saved thee; his meaning is, that himself being
received by faith had saved her. As for the similitude of the hand: I say thus,
that if relief by alms, or cure by Phy^cke were promised upon this condition
only, that whosoever would but put forth his hand to receive the alms, or the
Physic, should be releeved or cured; it might truly be said, that by the
hand, as the instrument, ^elatively, the party is releeved, or cured. For such
gracious promises has God made to us, that if we shall but put forth the hand
of faith to receive Christ, we shall be justified and saved from our sins.
And such is the account that he makes of this instrument by which only we
receive Christ, that for our comfort he may say unto any true believer, as he
did to the woman, thy faith has saved thee. For as when the people of Israel
Ioh. 3. i4, 15.
were bitten by the fiery Serpents, the Lord having promised safely to all that
should but li^t up their eyes to behold the brazen Serpent, which Moses had set
on high to that purpose: it might then have been said of those that were
saved, that their eye had cured them: So our Savior was lift up, upon the
cross, that whosoever does but look upon him with the eye of faith, shall be
saved. Not that the hand absolutely does releeve or cure, but relatively in
respect of the alms, or of the medicine, which it does receive. Nor that the
eye of the body did cure those who were stung, but the brazen Serpent which was
a figure of Christ, beheld with the eye: Nor the eye of the soul, which is
faith, does absolutely and by it self justify or save, but relatively in
respect of the object, which it does behold, that is to say, the Lord Jesus,
whom God has propounded to be a Savior to all that see Ioh. 6. 40. His second
proof out of Mat. 15. 28. Mark 7. 29.
him, and receive him by faith.

. XII. His second proof is from the speech of Christ to the woman of Canaan,
who had earnestly prayed unto him, and would take no repulse, Matthew. 15. 28. O
woman great is thy faith, and Mar. 7. 29. for this saying, go thy way, the
Devil is gone out of thy daughter, for here plainly, says he, the efficacy
of obtaining health is attributed to faith. Neither may it be answered, that it
is one thing to speak of justification, and another to speak of the cure of a
bodily disease. For our Lord in the very same words attributes to faith both
the one and the other. For as he said to the woman, which was a sinner, Luke
7. 50. thy faith has saved thee; so in like manner, to the woman, whom he
cured of a bloody issue. Matthew. 9. 2^. and to the blind man, whom he restored
to sight. Mark. 10. 52. Answer. Though the woman of Canaan, and the blind man
by prayer obtained their desires; yet it was the prayer of faith, as Saint
James calls it, which was effectual and prevailed with Christ, Iam. 5. 16.
and therefore to faith, I confess, the efficacy is to be ascribed. And
although it may well be thought, that our Savior, when he used the same
words, thy faith has saved thee, to the woman which had the issue of blood,
and to the blind man, which he used to the sinner, whose sins he had forgiven:
that he, being the Physician of the soul, used them in the same sense, to
assure them of a greater blessing, than the bodily cure: Matthew. 9. 2. yet I do
not deny, but that by faith and by the prayer of faith, the health both of the
body and soul is obtained, for as by believing, or apprehending by faith the
righteousness of Christ, which he had and performed for us, we are
justified: so by believing the divine power and goodness of Christ many were
cured of their bodily diseases. And yet as it was not their faith apprehending
the power and goodness of Christ, which did heal them, but the power and
goodness of Christ which by faith they apprehended, as it is said Act. 3. 16.
his Name, by faith in his name, has made this man strong: so is it not our
faith absolutely, whereby we apprehend the righteousness of Christ, which
does justify us, but the righteousness of Christ apprehended by faith. And
whereas Bellarmine will have the like efficacy to be ascribed in justifying
unto faith, as in obtaining bodily health, I take him at his word, for hereby
it is evidently proved, that faith alone does justify, for our Savior for the
obtaining of bodily health required faith only. Luke 8. 50. Mar. 5. 36. Be
not afraid, Only believe: and the like may be gathered out of Matthew. 9. 28,
29. Mark. 9. 23. John 11. 40.

. XIII. His third proof is from the example of Abraham; Romans His third proof
from the example of Abraham.
4. 20, 21, 22. In the promise also of God he staggered not by distrust, but
was strengthened in faith giving glory to God, most fully knowing, (...)
(or being fully persuaded) that whatsoever he promi^ed he also is able to
perform, therefore it was also reputed to him for righteousness. Here, says
Bellarmine, the Apostle renders the cause, why faith was reputed to Abraham
for righteousness, because by believing he gave glory to God. Therefore that
faith pleased God, by which he was glorified, and therefore by the m^rit of
that faith which notwithstanding was the gift and grace of God, he justified
Abraham. His reason may thus be framed.

Whatsoever pleases God meriteth justification.

Abraham's faith pleased God, because he was glorified thereby.

Therefore Abraham's faith merited justification.

The proposition is to be denied, for before men can please God, they must be
reconciled unto him and justified by faith, therefore our pleasing of God is
not a cause, but a fruit of our justification, and it is evident, that before
that promise was either made to him by God, or believed by him, Abraham was
justified, and therefore not by the merit of that belief. Again, where men or
their actions do please God, not in and for themselves, but in and for Christ
in whom alone he is well pleased, there mercy is to be ascribed unto God,
but not merit to them.

Yea, but the Apostle infers, therefore it was reputed to him for
righteousness. That argues Gods acceptance, not his merit. Howbeit that
place may be understood, as that Iam. 2. 23. that this was an evidence of the
true faith of Abraham which was imputed to him for righteousness, not that
Abraham did then first believe, or was then first justified, and much less
that he merited by that act of faith his justification, which he had long
before.

. XIV. His fourth proof is out of Romans 10. 13, 14. to which I answered His
fourth proof out of Romans 10. 1^, 14.
before Cap. 10.. 8.
the thing which here he would, but does not prove, though indeed it needs no
proof. is, that faith by invocation obtains justification. Howbeit the
Apostle does not there set down the order of our justification, but the series
and order of the degrees of salvation beginning at our vocation, unto which
three degrees are referred, viz. hearing of the word, which presupposes
preaching, and that sending, upon which follows faith and justification
thereby, faith brings forth the duties of ^anctification, and namely
invocation, which sometimes, and namely in that place of Joel Joel 2. 32.
is put for the whole worship of God, which is the forerunner of salvation, but
here is no snch thing, *either mentioned or meant, that by invocation faith
obtains justification, and therefore little reason had he from thence to
infer, that therefore faith does not justify relatively by receiving for
sooth justification offered, but by seeking, knocking, as^ing, and finally by
invocating and impe^rating it, does justify. but passing by the weakness of
his argument, I answer to that which he infers, that faith beggeth
justification, no otherwise, but with relation to Christ and his merits by it
received. For as God forgiveth no sins, for which Christ has not satisfied,
nor accepts any man to life, for whom Christ has not merited it: so are not
we to beg justification at the hands of God, but in the name and mediation of
Christ beseeching God for Christ his sake, that forasmuch as Christ has
satisfied the justice of God for the sins of all that believe in him, and
has merited salvation and all spiritual blessings in heavenly things for
them: that it would therefore please God to accept of Christ's satisfaction and
merits in our behalf, imputing unto us both his sufferings for the remission
of sins, and his obedience for the acceptance unto life, of us who receiving
him by faith, desire to be made partakers of his merits to our justification.
For as in our minds we receive Christ by a lively assent or belief, as has
been showed: so in our hearts we receive him by an earnest desire, expressed
in our prayers to be made partakers of him and his merits. Neither does it
follow, that if by faith we imp^trate or obtain remission of sins, that
therefore faith is the meritorious cause of justification, unless it be
understood relatively, in respect of Christ: who is the only meritorious
cause, both of our justification, and salvation, whom faith, as the instrument,
does apprehend.

. XV. His fifth and last reason is out of Heb. 11. Where the Apostle His fifth
proof out of Heb. 11.
by many examples teaches, that by faith men do please God: and consequently,
that faith is of great price and merit with God. Answ. That faith does please
God and is of high account with God, I mean a true lively justifying faith
(not the faith of Papists hypocrites and Devils) we freely acknowledge to the
honor of God the giver of it, and to the shame of the Papists, who, for all
their saire pretenses here, do much vilify it. Howbeit merit we ascribe none
to it, unless it be relatively, by apprehending Christ's merits to our
justification and salvation. That Abel, Henoch, and others mentioned Heb. 11.
did please God by faith, does not disprove our justification relatively, but
proves it. For God is pleased with none but in Christ, in whom he is well
pleased. He is pleased with none in Christ, but with them only, that by faith
receive him.

. XVI. To these places of Scripture, Bellarmine adds ten testimonies out of
Augustine, nine whereof do testify, that by faith Ten testimonies out of
Augustine.
righteousness is impetrated, that is, by request obtained: and the
righteousness which he speaks of, is not the righteousness of
justification, but of sanctification. Neither do they prove any thing in this
point but what we confess; that by faith, which purifieth the heart, and
works by love, we obtain (for that Augustine means by merits) both the
graces, that is, the habits and the fruits, that is the acts of sanctification,
which we call good works, The testimonies are these Retract. l. 1. c. 33

Fides and non potita conceditur, ut ei potenti alia concedantur. His tenth
testimony which in order is the second, Nec ipsa remissio peccatorum sine
aliquo merito est, si fides hanc impetrat. neither is the remission of sins
it self without any merit, if faith do obtain it. Neither is there no merit
of faith, by which faith he said, Luke 18. 13.
O God be merciful to me a sinner: and worthily did that faithful man being
humbled go home justified, because he that humbles himself shall be
exalted. Where Augustine abusively uses, as other Latin Fathers often do,
the word merit in the sense of obtaining and that by request: and that
appears by Bellar. deg^atia and lib. arbitr. lib. 1. cap. 14.. hanc esse
Solet Augustinus meritum appellare quemlibet actum bo* number, ratione cu ius
aliquid aliud accipimus.
Bellarmines own confession, that Augustine does use to call merit any good
work, in respect whereof we obtain some other thing: and by the place it
self. In which sense, he says, the Publican by his humble and faithful
prayer, having obtained remission of sins, went home justified. For if merit,
properly so called, did go before remission of siune, then men should merit
before they be in state of grace, which Bellarmine denies; then should we
not be justified, either gratis, that is, as all, even Bellarmine himself,
expound it, sine meritis, or by the grace, that is, the gracious and undeserved
favor of God, when we deserved the contrary. Again, before remission of
sins and justification all men be sinners and unjust. Now, as Augustine
says in the very next words going before, quid habere boni meriti possunt
peccatores? What good merit can sinners have? and a little before that, meritis
impii non grattam, sed poena debetur: To the merits of a wicked man not grace,
but punishment is due. Finally, the Papists themselves ordinarily confess,
that their first justification cannot be merited which is grace only, and not
reward. Though some of them sometimes do talk of merits of congruity, which
properly are no merits: or if they be, Pelagius his maine error must take
place, gratiam secundum merita dari, that grace is given according to merits.
Bellarmine here says that he has proved De poenit. l. 2. c. 12.
elsewhere, that faith, and contrition, and other dispositions do merit the
grace of justification: which the Council of Joss. 6. cap. 8.
Trent expressly denies.

. XVII. His fifth principal argument to prove that faith alone De justis. l.
^. cap. 18.
does not justify, consists of two arguments drawn from two principles,
which he will but point at now, but hereafter demonstrate. The one is from the
formal cause of justification: the other, from the necessity of good works
unto salvation. For if the formal cause of our justification be a
righteonsness^ infused, and really inherent in us, and not the righteousness
of Christ apprehended by faith; then faith alone does not justify: but the
former is true: therefore the latter.

The consequence of the proposition we grant, for unto sanctification faith
alone does not suffice: but there must be a concurrence, not only of other
habitual graces thereunto, but also of actual obedience. But justification is
not to be confounded with sanctification. Neither do we say, that the
righteousness of Christ is the formal cause of justification, but the matter,
by imputation whereof we are justified.

The assumption, namely, that we are justified by a righteousness infused, and
really inherent in us, he says, he will fully prove in the next book De
justif. l. 2.
But all his proofs I have already fully answered and confuted Lib. 4. and 5.
in the third and fourth controversies concerning the matter and form of
justification, and have by necessary arguments, both disproved the negative, to
wit, that we are not justified by any righteousness inherent in us, or
infused into us: and proved the affirmative, viz. that we are justified only
by the righteousness of Christ imputed unto us. From whence I have also
demonstrated the truth of this assertion, that we are justified by faith alone,
that is, by the righteousness of Christ alone, apprehended only by Faith.

A TREATISE OF JUSTIFICATION.
THE SEVENTH BOOK: Concerning good Works.
CAHP. I. To avoid Popish calumniations, it is showed, that we do hold the
necessity of good works, and do urge the same by better arguments, than the
Popish religion does afford.
. I.

AS touching his last argument, which he The first calumniation, that we deny
the necessity of good works.
brings to prove, that faith does not justify alone, drawn from the
necessity of good works, I am now to treat. For this is the sixth capital
Error of the Papists in the controversy of justification, in that they
stiffely hold, that good works are necessarily required unto justification, as
causes thereof and to salvation as the merit thereof. But before I dispute the
question, I am to meet with some calumniations of the Papists. The first, that
we by denying the necessity of good works as being neither causes of
justification, nor merits of Salvation, do dis^ourage the people from well.
doing; and by teaching that by says alone we are justified and saved, do
animate and encourage them, to the practice of all sin and iniquity.

I answer, that we do not deny the necessity of good works, and that w^ use
better arguments to deter the people from sin, and to encourage them to well
doing, than the Papists by their doctrine can do. For to teach men to do good
works with an opinion either of satisfaction, propitiation, or of merits, which
are the three chief arguments of the Papists, that they are satisfactory,
propitiatory and meritorious, is to teach men to mar good works rather than to
make them. Because a good work undertaken with an opinion, either of
satisfaction or justification by them, or of merit, though otherwise it were
good, becomes abominable unto God, as der^gating from ^he alone and
all-sufficient merit and satisfaction of Christ. Neither can they encourage men
to well doing by these arguments, that by their good works they are justified,
and for them shall be saved; whiles t^eir conscience must needs tell them, that
besides the guilt of their manifold sins, their good works are impure, and
that they can merit nothing at the hands of God, but punishment These therefore
who have just cause to doubt, or rather to despair of justification by their
works, and of salvation by their merits; cannot by these arguments receive
true encouragement to well doing, but rather discouragement there from. But
although we deny good works to be either causes of justification, or merits
of Salvation: yet we affirm them to be not only (...), good and Tit. 3. 8, 14.
profitable, but also (...), necessary. The which I will show to prevent both
the malicious slanders of the Papists, and also the profane abuse of carnal
Gospellers, who turn Jude 4.
the grace of God into wantonness. Good, I say, as being commended and
commanded of God, and therefore to be ensued, Phil. 4. 8. Romans 12. 17. Psalm.

only privative (if I may so speak) but also positive. Privative, because
without them the profession of faith is not only vain and unprofitable, but
also hurtful and pernicious: Vain, because such a ^aith is dead Jam. 2. 14.

necessity; and so of infallibility: first, in respect of Gods decree.
where is weeping and gnashing of teeth.

. III. They are necessary also by a positive necessity, and that manifold. As
first by the necessity of infallibility, in respect of Gods

Decree, Word, Oath.
In respect of of his decree. For whom God has predestined to salvation, he
has predestined unto Ephesians. 1. 4. 2 These. 2. 13.
sanctification; that they may be conformable to the Rom 8. 29.
image of his Son. And therefore whosoever does hope 1 John 3. 3.
to become like unto Christ in glory, he must endeavor, in some measure, to
resemble him in grace. We exhort therefore our hearers, that they do not abase
the doctrine of predestination, with those who were called predestinatiani, as
to think, that either because they suppose they are elected, they shall be
saved, howsoever they live: or because they think, that they are not elected,
they cannot be saved, though they should live never so godly: as if godliness,
if they be elect, were needless, or if not, bootlesse. But forbearing to prye
into Gods secret counsels, (which are to be adored and not searched into) to
have recourse to Gods word. For the Deuteronomy. 29. 29.
secret things belong unto the Lord our God; but the revealed things to us,
that we may do them. For there we shall find these two things: first, that
where God has ordained the end, he has also ordained the means. And
therefore as it is necessary, that the end should be accomplished, because
decreed by God: so it is as necessary in respect of the same decree, that the
end should be achieved by the same means which God has preordained. Now,
whom God has elected, them he calls Romans 8. 30.
, whom he calls (according to his purpose) them he justifies by faith, whom
he justifies by faith, them he sanctifies by his Spirit* whom he calls,
justifies, and sanctifies, them, and no other, he glorifieth. Therefore as it
is necessary in respect of Gods decree, that those who are elected shall be
saved: so it is as necess^ry in respect of the same decree, that they should
attain to salvation by these degrees: that is, first they must be called and
converted unto God, they must be justified by a true faith, they must in some
measure be sanctified by the holy Spirit. The second thing is, that in the word
the Lord reveals his purpose concerning those that live well or ill. Thou
think, because thou have a conceit that thou art elected, thou can not be
damned, though thou live never so wickedly. But be not deceived, for God has
revealed his purpose concerning impenitent sinners, who live and dye in sin
unrepented of 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10. Gal. 5. 21. Ephesians. 5. 5, 6.
, that there is no inheritance for them in the kingdom of God. As for example,
thou art a drunkard and wilt not be reclaimed from this sin, and yet
presumest that thou shall be saved, because thou have a conceit, that thou art
elected. But be not deceived; no drunkards shall inherit the kingdom of God.
On the other side, thou have a conceit, that because thou art not elected, thou
can not be saved, though thou should live never so godly. But the
Scripture is plain, that whosoever truly believes in Christ, whosoever
unfainedly repents him of his sins, whosoever walks uprightly before God
making Conscience of his ways, he shall be saved. Therefore whatsoever thy
conc^it may be, concerning thine election, or not election, if thou do
truly believe in Christ, and repenting of thy sins do endeavor to lead a
good life, as sure as God is true, thou shall be saved.

. IV. Secondly, in respect of Gods Word which is infallibly true. Secondly, in
respect of Gods Word.
Now the word plainly testifies, that whosoever is in Christ, 2 Cor. 5. 17.
is a new creature; that those who are in Christ, Romans 8. 1.
live not after the flesh but after the Spirit: that they who are Christ's, do
crucify Gal. 5. 24.
the flesh with ^he lusts thereof: that Christ was made unto us, not only
righteousness 1 Cor. ^. 30.
and redemption, but also sanctification: that Christ came not with water
alone, 1 Ioh. 5. 6. Ioh. 19. 34, 35.
or blood alone, but with water and blood: the blood of redemption to cleanse
us from the guilt of sin: and the water of ablution to purge us from the
pollution of sin: that in whom Christ dwells by faith, Ephesians. 3. 17.
he dwells in them by his Spirit, and that if any man have not the Spirit
Romans 8. 9.
of Christ, he is none of his: that faith being a fruit of the Spirit, and a
grace of regeneration, it cannot be where the Spirit of grace and regeneration
is not, and that unless men be regenerate and borne anew, Ioh 3. 3.
they cannot see the Kingdom of God.

. V. Thirdly, in respect of Gods Oath, in which it is impossible Thirdly, in
respect of Gods Oath.
Heb. 6. 18.
that he should lie. Now God has sworn, that whom he redeemeth from the hand
of their spiritual enemies, Luke 1. 73, 74, 75.
he will give them to worship him in holiness and righteousness before him
all the days of their life. For redemption is as well from the dominion of
sin, as from the guilt of it. As for those, who commit sin, Ioh. 8. 34.
that is, in whom sin reigns, they are the servants of sin, and therefore
not actually redeemed by Christ; for whom the Son freeth, verse. 36.
they are free indeed. Those that are freed from sin Romans 6. 18.
become the servants of righteousness. Those that are delivered from the hand,
that is, the power of their spiritual enemies, are ipso facto made the
servants of God 1 Cor. 6. 19. Servi quia servati.
whose service is true freedom. Thus much of the necessity of infallibility.

justification, whereby our faith is Jam. 2. 18.
to be demonstrated, whereby we are to make our calling, and our election 2
Pet. 1. 10.
sure. Our election can not be known a priori, by any foregoing things, but a
posteriori, and namely by the fruits of sanctification, which are also the
fruits of our election. For by a godly life our faith and justification is
manifested 1 Ioh. 3. 7. (^n respect whereof the faithful are said to be
justified by their works, Iam. 2. 21, 25.) being justified, Romans 8* 30.
it is certain, that they are called according to his purpose: and i^ so
called, then elected: are they elected? then undoubtedly they shall be saved.
They are the cognizances of them Psalm. 15. Psalm. 24. 3, 4.
that are to be saved; for by faith we receive the inheritance among them
that are Act. 26., 8. and 20. 32.
sanctified. They are the evidences, by which we shall be judged at the last
day: at which time God will judge men 1 Pet. 1. 17. Mat. 16. 27. Romans 2. 6.
Apoc. 22. 12.
according to their works. For we must all appear before the judgment seat
of Christ, that we may receive according to those things which we have done in
the body, 2 Cor. 5. 10.
whether it be good or evil. Those that have done good, Mat. 25. 46. Ioh. 5.
29.
shall go into everlasting life: and they that have done evil, into
everlasting punishment. For good works, though we are not justified by them,
nor saved for them: yet they are the evidence, according to which our Savior
will pronounce the sentence of salvation Matthew. 25. 34, 35. According to that
Psalm. 62. 12. And to thee Lord, mercy, for thou rewardest a man (meaning the
godly man) according to his works.

. IX. Lastly, they are necessary necessitate medij, and as that, which
Fourthly, necessitate medis.
though it be no cause, is called causa sine qua n^n. And thus they are
necessary, first, as the way, which leads to life eternal, via qua nos
perducturus est ad finem itsum quem promisit, Aug. in Psalm. 109.
the way by which he will bring us unto that end which he has promised, says
Augustine. For those that are justified, and by justification entitled to the
Kingdom of heaven, they are to go in the way of sanctification toward their
glorification, E^h. 2. 10. good works therefore though they be not the cause
of reigning yet they are the way to the Kingdom. And so says Bellarmin^
himsel^e, De gratia and lib. arbitr. lib. 2. cap. 13.
that although God in predestination has determined to give the Kingdom of
heaven to certain men whom he loved without any prevision of works:
notwithstanding he did withal ordain that in respect of the execution, the
way to come to his Kingdom, should be good works. I say then with the Prophet
Esaias, Esa. 30. 21.
this is the way let us walk in it. Secondly, as necessary fruits of our
election, for we are elected to that end that we should be holy, Ephesians. 1. 4.
as necessary fruits of faith, without which it is judged to be dead, ^am. 2.
26. as unseparable consequents of our redemption and justification, Luke 1. 74.
And as they are necessary consequents of our justification, so they are
necessary forerunners of salvation, by which we are fitted for Gods Kingdom,
because no unclean thing can enter into the Kingdom of heaven, Apoc. 21. 27.
and finally so necessary is a godly life, that without it no man shall see God.
Heb. 12. 14. I conclude with Bernard, De gratia and lib. arbitr in sine^
that good works are occulia predestinationis jndicia, futur^ f^licitatis
presagia, via regni, non ca^saregnandi, tokens of our secret predestination,
presages of our future happiness, the way to the Kingdom, but not the cause
of our obtaining that Kingdom. For howsoever good works are necessary in many
respects, as I have showed, necessitate presentiae; yet they are not necessary
necessitate efficientiae, as causes of our justification.

. X. Secondly, the Papists calumniate us, as if we taught that The second
calumniation.
good works are not necessary to sanctification, which slander, as all the
rest, arises from their wilful and pernicious error in consounding
justific^tion and sanctification. In the question of justification we hold,
according to the Scriptures, that if our own works or righteousness should
be obtruded unto the Lord as the matter or merit thereof, whereby we should
be both acquitted from our sins and so delivered from hell and also
entitled to the Kingdom of heaven, they are not only to be rejected, but
also detested as Esa. 64. 6.
menstruous clouts, as dung, Phil 3, 8, 9.
as loss. But in the question of sanctification, where they are considered,
both as fruits of faith and the Spirit, as consequents of justification,
whereby we testify our thankfulness to God, gather testimonies to our
selves of our justification, benefit and edify our brethren^ and also as
necessary forerunners of glorification, whereby we are fitted and prepared for
Gods Kingdom (unto which by justification we are entitled) and as the way
wherein we are to walk toward our heavenly country, and as the evidences
according to which our Savior will judge us at the last day, etc. we do
acknowledge they are highly to be esteemed of, as those things wherein our
sanctification does in good part consist. For we do teach, that our
sanctification is partly habitual, consisting in the habits of sanctifying
graces, faith, hope, charity, humility, the fear of God, etc. which is the
first justification of the Papists: and partly actual consisting in our new
obedience, or, which is all one, in good works; which is their second
justification. This then is that which we do hold, that although good works
do not concur with faith unto the act of justification, as any cause
thereof: yet of necessity they must concur in the subject, that is, the party
justified, as necessary fruits of faith, as necessary consequents of
justification, as necessary antecedents of salvation. And this is that, which
not only we, but Bellarmine himself often cites out of Augustine: Bona opera
accedunt justificato, non praecedunt justificandum: or thus, bona opera non
praecedunt justificandum sed sequantur justificatum, good works do not go
before, but follow after justification, which is a pregnant proof, that they
are no causes thereof.

CAP. II. That we are not justified by Works.
. I.

HAving thus avoided the calumniations of the In what sense we deny works to
justify.
Papists, we are now to dispute the question: which is to be understood, not
of justification before men, whereby we are declared or known to be just: but
of our justification before God, whereby he makes us just: nor of works, as
fruits and consequents, but as of causes of justification. For we do confess,
that men are justified declarative, that is declared and known to be just to
themselves or others by good works, as the proper fruits of faith, and
undoubted consequents of justification: but we deny that we are justified
before God by good works, as any causes thereof. And this our assertion we will
first prove by necessary arguments, and then defend the same against the
objections of the Papists. Proved, first from all the five articles before
handled.


. II. And first I prove it by all the arguments which I used before, to prove
the five several points already handled. For first, if justification is not to
be confounded with sanctification, as if it consisted in a righteousness
inherent in our selves, or performed by our selves; then are we not justified
before God by works, But the former has been clearly proved; therefore the
latter is to be confessed.

.2 If we be justified by the mere grace of God, and that freely, without
respect of any works done by us; then are we not justified before God by
works. For the holy Ghost makes such an opposition Romans 11. 6. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9.
between grace and works, that if we be justified by the one, we cannot be
justified by the other. But the antecedent has been formerly proved,
therefore the consequent cannot be denied.

3. If we be not justified before God by righteousness inherent in, or
performed by our selves, but only by the righteousness of Christ through
faith, then are we not justified by works. But the first I have demonstrated
by many undeniable arguments: therefore the second must be granted.

4. If we be justified by imputative righteousness, that is to say by the
righteousness of Christ imputed to them that believe, the Lord imputing
righteousness unto them Romans 4. 5, ^.
without works; then it is evident, that we are not justified by works, but
that is most true, as has plentifully been proved; therefore this.

5. If we be justified by faith alone, then not by works. But we are justified
by faith alone, as has been proved; therefore not by works. The arguments
reduced to these five heads, which were very many, and impregnable, might
satisfy any reasonable man, who is not wilfully addicted to his own erroneous
conceits, though I should add no more: but because we have to deal with men
unreasonable I will add some.

. III. And first out of Romans 4. 4, 5, 6. He that works not, is not Four
other reasons.
justified by works: he that believes, works not, as the Apostle there
shows. And again, to whom faith is impured unto righteousness without
works, they are not justified by works: to all the faithful faith is imputed
unto righteousness without works, therefore none of the faithful are
justified by works. The assumption is thus proved: If to Abraham his faith was
imputed for righteousness without works, then are all the faithful justified
without works: for Abraham is by the Apostle propounded as a pattern:
therefore as he was justified so are we, Romans 4. 22, 23. 24.

But to Abraham his faith was imputed for righteousness, as the Apo stle
teaches, Romans 4. 3, 4, 5. Therefore all the faithful are justified without
works.

2. The true doctrine of justification is taught in the Scriptures:
justification by works is not taught in the Scriptures: for the justification
taught in the Scriptures, is an action of God justifying a sinner, but this by
works, is neither an action of God, neither is it the justification of a
sinner, but the action of the justitiary himself, who by the exercise and
practice of good works increases his inherent justice, or fanctification:
which has no affinity with that justification, which is taught in the
Scriptures.

3. None that are justified by faith are justified by works; all the faithful
are justified by faith, therefore none of the faithful are justified by
works. The proposition is evidently proved by that opposition which the
Apostle constantly makes between faith and works in the question of
justification: asfirming that men though abounding with works of grace, are
justified by faith without works, and saved by faith and not by works, Romans
3. 28. and 4. 3, 4, 5. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. Tit. 3. 5.

4. If any be justified by works, then either the regenerate man or the
unregenerate: but neither the unregenerate, as the Papists confess: nor the
regenerate, for they are justified already. Neither do the Scriptures
acknowledge any sorts or degrees of justification before God.

. IV. 5. All that are justified by works, are justified by that obedience Our
sifth argument.
which they perform to the Law: But none are justified by the obedience which
they perform to the Law: therefore none are justified by works.

The proposition is manifest. Because the Law being a perfect rule of all
inherent righteousness, there neither are nor can be any good works, which are
not prescribed in the Law. Yea, whatsoever work is not conmable to the Law is
sin.

The assump^ion may be proved by many undeniable arguments. First, by all
those places, which plainly testify, that by the works of the Law, that is,
by obedience done to the Law, no man living shall be justified, Romans 3. 20, 28.
Gal. 2. 16. For by the works of the Law we understand all duties prescibed,
and all that obedience which is required in the Law.

2. Those that are accursed by the Law are not justified by their obedience of
it. For to be justified, is to be blessed, Romans 4. 6. and therefore to be
justified, and to be accursed, are things repugnant.

But all men whatsoever, even those which seek to be justified by their
obedience to the Law, are by the Law accursed. Therefore no man is justified by
his obedience performed to the Law. And this is the Apostles argument, Gal. 3.
10. as I have showed before Lib. 4.
. All transgressors of the Law, are by the Law accursed.

All men since the fall are transgressors of the Law, Christ only (...)
excepted; this assumption the Apostle omitteth, because he takes it for
granted, as being a truth received among the faithful in those times, though
in these days denied by the justitiaries of Rome, but elsewhere it is by the
Apostle expressed, as Romans 3. 23. all have sinned. Wherefore as God has
concluded all under sin, Romans 11. 32. Gal. 3. 22. so the Law has concluded
them under the curse.

3. All that are justified by their obedience to the Law do perfectly fulfill
it, by a total, perfect, and perpetual obedience: for he that does not so
fulfill it, by doing the things commanded, though he did nothing that is
forbidden; by doing all, though he did the most; by continuing in doing all,
and in that measure and degree, which the Law requires, though he sinned but
once in all his life, and that either by omission, or coming short of his
duty, is a transgressour of the Law, and therefore subject to the curse of the
Law, because he has not continued in all things which are written in the
book of the Law to do them. And he that offends in one is guilty of all,
Iam. 2. 10.

To whom the perfect fulfilling of the Law is impossible by reason of the
flesh, they cannot be justified by their obedience performed to it.

To all, even the most regenerate, the perfect fulfilling of the Law is
impossible by reason of the flesh, Romans 8. 3. Gal. 5. 17. as elsewhere I prove
at large. Therefore none though regenerate can be justified by their obedience
performed to the Law.

. V. Sixthly, That Doctrine which is repugnant to the Scriptures is false.

The Doctrine of justification by works, is repugnant to the Scriptures.

Therefore it is false.

The assumption is thus proved, because the Scriptures in all places where they
treat of justification before God, do from the act of justification exclude
works. The places of Scripture which we produce to this end, Bellarmine
recites (at least some of them) with purpose De justif. li. cap. 19
to answer them.

Romans 3. 27. Where is boasting then? It is excluded. By what Law? Rom 3. 27, 28.
Of works? No, but by the Law of faith.

Verse 28. Therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the
works of the Law; to which he might have added, verse 20. Therefore by the
deeds of the Law there shall no flesh be justified. Romans 9. 20.


Romans 4. 2. If Abraham were justified by works, he has whereof to glory, but
not before God. To which he might have added verse. 5. and 6. Romans 3. 2, 5, 6.
To him that works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly, his
faith is counted for righteousness: even as David also describes the
blessedness of the man, unto whom God imput^h righteousness without works.

Gal. 2. 16 Knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the Gal. 2. 16.
Law, but by the faith of Jesus Christ: to which add the words following in
the same verse, for by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified: add
also, Chap. 3. verse. 10. and 11. as many as are of the works Gal. 3. 10, 1^.
of the Law, that is, who seek justification by the works of the Law are
under the curse. For it is written cursed is every one that continues not in
all the things which are written in the Book of the Law to do them. But that
no man is just^fied by the Law in the sight of God, it is evident; for the just

. VI. Bellarmine, before he makes answer to these testimonies, Bellarmines
preamble to his answer, in which he notes three things: first, what is meant
by the Law of works and by the Law of faith.
notes three things. First, what the Apostle means, by the Law of works,
and by the Law of Faith. Secondly, what difference there is betwixt the justice
of the Law: and the justice in the Law. Thirdly, what the Apostle means by
works, when he says a man is justified without works. For the first: he
cavilleth with Calvin and Chemnitius and others, as though they understood
simply by the Law of works, that which requires works, and by the Law of
faith, which requires faith: as if the Law of faith did not also require
works, and the Law of works did not also require faith: whereas our writers
distinguish the two covenants of God, that is, the Law and the Gospel, whereof
one is the covenant of works, the other, the covenant of grace: do teach,
that the Law of works is that, which to justification requires works, as the
condition thereof: the Law of faith that, which to justification requires
faith, as the condition thereof. The former says, do this, and thou shall
live, Romans 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12. Mat. 19. 17. the latter, believe in Christ, and
thou shall be saved, John. 3. 16. Act. 16. 31. But the Papists, whiles they
teach that in the Gospel perfect righteousness is required in us to
justification and salvation as the condition thereof, as much or rather more
than in the Law: they do either confound the Law and the Gospel, making
either of them to be the Law of works; Gal. 1. 6, 8, 9.
or else as the Apostle speaks of the false teachers of the Galathians, they
teach another Gospel than that which Christ and his Apostles taught: which
whosoever does, though he were an Angel from heaven, he ought to be held
accursed. But you will say, is not obedience to the Law required in the
Gospel? I answer, it is not required unto justification and salvation as the
condition: but the ability of performing obedience is the grace of the New
Testament, which is promised Luke 1. 74. Jer. 31. 33. Heb. 8. 10.
to those that believe. And therefore our new obedience is required, as the
fruit of our redemption, and as the way wherein we being justified are to
walk toward our glorification, and as the cognizance of them that shall be
saved.

. VII. Bellarmine having rejected our exposition, sets down Bellarmines
exposition.
his own, the sum and effect whereof in plain terms is thus. That the Law
of works is the letter or the doctrine, whether of the Law or of the Gospel
prescribing what is to be done, but affording no help to perform the same.
And that the Law of faith is the Spirit, or the grace of the New testament
promised to those that believe, whereby they are enabled to perform that which
is commanded. Which distinction between the letter and the Spirit, as it is
propounded by Saint De spir. and lit.
Augustine, is true, but cannot be applied to this place, Romans 3. 27. where,
by Law on both parts is meant Doctrine, according to the proper signification
of the Hebrew word Thorah. The Law of works signifying the Moral Law, which
unto justification requires works: the Law of faith, signifying the Gospel,
which to justification requires faith only, and is therefore called the R^m.
10. 8.
word of faith, and the Law of faith. For although Bellarmine elsewhere De
jus^is. l. 4. cap. 2.
seems to make this to be a principal difference between the Law and the
Gospel: that the Law is the letter commanding: the Gospel is the Law of
faith, meaning thereby the grace of the New Testament, which is the Law written
in our hearts, whereby we are enabled to perform obedience to the Law: yet he
confesses, that the Gospel in the Scriptures does ever signify the doctrine
of the Gospel, and withal confesses, the doctrine of the Gospel, as it
commands any thing, to be a Law of works. So that lex fidei (the Law of
faith) according to this exposition, is as well opposed to the Gospel, as it
signifies the doctrine thereof, as to the Law. But the difference between the
Law of works, which is the moral Law, and the Law of faith which is the
Gospel, in the question of justification, whereof the Apostle treats, is to
be fetched from that righteousness, which either of them requires to
justification. For both of them require righteousness thereunto. The Law
requires the righteousness of works: the Gospel, in which without the Law
is revealed the righteousness of God (by which we are justified) teaches the
righteousness of faith, (...): In Romans 3 27. homil. 7.
says Chrysostom upon this place, (...) what is the Law of says? to be saved
by grace. And this explication fitly agrees to the scope of the Apostle,
teaching that by the doctrine, not of the Law but of the Gospel, all boasting
is excluded. As if the Apostle had thus argued: The true doctrine of
justification excludes all boasting. See Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. but the Law of
works, that is, that doctrine which teaches justification by works does not
exclude all boasting. See Romans 4. 2. which the Law of faith does, teaching that
we are justified by remission of sins, and saved by grace, therefore that
doctrine, which teaches justification by works, is not the true doctrine, but
that which teaches justification by faith without works.

. VIII. As touching the difference which he puts between Justice Of the
Law. In and by the law.
the justice of the Law, or that which is in it, or by it. I have spoken before
Lib. 4. cap. 8.. 2, 3, 4.
in the third question of this controversy: where I showed, that if it be
admitted, according to Augustines meaning, who was the Author of it, it makes
wholly against Bellarmine. For though a man could perform justitiam legis
considered in the abstract, (as it is described in the doctrine of the Law, and
as Bellarmine himself, De justif. lib. 1. cap. 1. does consider it,) would
justify him, because it is perfect: yet considered in the concrete for that
righteousness, which men attain unto in or by the Law, does not justify,
because it is unperfect. And therefore that righteousness which men have in or
by the Law, does not fulfill the righteousness of the Law, which the Apostle
calls (...). These two distinctions Bellarmine has devised to shift off
only two of the places cited, viz. Romans 3. 27. and Phil. 3. 8, 9. both which,
distinctions being rightly understood, make against himself, as I have showed.

. IX. Now he comes to the third thing, viz. what is meant by Thirdly, what is
meant by works.
works. For says he, our adversaries by works, which the Apostle excludes
from justification, understand all works, whether done before or after faith;
yea; faith it self considered as a work, which opinion to be most absurd, and
proceeding from the ignorance of the Scriptures, Augustine, says he,
teaches. De gratia and lib. arb. c. 7.
Men not understanding what the Apostle says, we make account that a man is
justified by faith without the works of the Law, have thought, that he had
said, that faith is sufficient to a man, though he live wickedly, and have no
good works, which, be it far from that Vessel of Election to think. And
far be it also from us so to think. But although faith alone does not
suffice unto the perfection of a Christian who is to be saved, yet it alone
suffices unto justification: wherein we have had the consent of many of the
Fathers. And although to the act of justifying nothing in us concurreth with
faith, but it alone suffices: yet in the party justified, there must concur
with faith, both inward graces and also outward works. But here the Papists are
divided among themselves. Some of them think that by the works of the Law,
are excluded, not the works of the moral but of the ceremonial Law: others,
that the works of the moral Law are also excluded; not all, but such as go
before faith, such as are done by the strength of nature without grace and
without faith. I answer first to both jointly, that not only the works of
the Law are expressly excluded, but all works whatsoever indefinitely, Romans
4. 2, 6. and 11. 6. Ephesians. 2. 9. and more specially, the works which we have
done in righteousness, Tit. 3. 5. the works which God has prepared for the
regenerate, that they should walk in them. Ephesians. 2. 9, 10. Again, in him
that is said not to work, works are not to be distinguished, but all are
understood to be excluded: but he that is justified by faith, is said not to
work, Romans 4. 4, 5. and to have righteousness imputed to him without works,
verse 6. Therefore his works are not to be distinguished but all are
understood to be excluded.

. X. To the former severally, I answer, first, that when the holy Some of the
Papists understand the ceremonial Law only.
Ghost names the Law indefinitely, he means either the whole Law which is
called Deuteronomy. 11. 1.
Mishmereth the observation of the Lord or his charge, containing three
branches, the moral; the ceremonial and the judicial Law, or the chief part,
which is the moral Law. And that the Apostle means it especially, because he
speaks of that Law, by which comes the knowledge of sin, and which was
common both to Jews and Gentiles, unto which the whole world was subject. Romans
3. 19, 20. whatsoever the Law says, it says to them who are under the Law,
that every mouth may be stopped, and all the world may become (...) obnoxious
to the judgment of God. Therefore by the deeds of the Law there shall no
flesh, that is, neither Jew nor Gentile be justified in his sight: for by the
Law comes the knowledge of sin. Romans 7. 7.
Moreover it is evident, that the Apostle in that place speaks of that Law,
which forbids moral offenses mentioned Romans 3. 10, etc.
from the tenth verse to the ninteenth, and by which all both Jews and
Gentiles are convicted to be under sin, ver. 9. and 19. Secondly, it is
unreasonable to be thought, that any man, who was a transgressour of the moral
Law, should look to be justified by the observation of the ceremonial Law
which was but a by-law, being but an appendice of the first table of the moral
Law, as the judicial was an appendice of the second table. And further, the
Apostle professes, that whosoever would be circumcised, was bound to the
performance of the whole Law. Therefore the observer of the ceremonial law,
could not be justified, without the observation of the moral law. Thirdly,
this answer which is given by some of the Pontificians, is rejected by
Bellarmine De justis. l. 1. cap. 19.
and the greater part of learned Papists, who with us following the
interpretation of Augustine and other of the ancient Fathers, do confess that
by the works of the law, which the Apostle excludes from justification, are
meant the Bellarmine and others understand also the works of the moral law,
but yet such only as go before (...).
works of the moral law, as well as of the rest.

. XI. But then say I, all good works whatsoever are excluded. For in the Law,
which is the perfect rule of all inherent righteousness, all good works are
prescribed: and therefore those which proceed from faith. For if charity, which
is the fulfilling of the law, proceeds from faith unfeigned, 1 Timothy 1. 5.
Esponc. in 1 Timothy 1. the end, that is, the fulfilling and consummation of the
Commandment, that is by (...) doche of the law, is love both of God and our
neighbor, out of a pure heart, that is purisied by faith. Salmero, the end,
that is, the complement or fulfilling of the precept, that is, of the law, is
the love of God and our neighbor proceeding from faith unfeigned, whereby a man
believes in Christ from his heart.
then do those good works which the law prescribes, proceed from faith also,
or else they are not such as the law requires. And therefore frivolous is the
distinction of Bellarmine and other Papists, who by the works of the law
excluded from justification, under^tand works done before or without faith by
the strength of nature, not works proceeding from faith, or works of grace.
The absurdity of which distinction being applied to the question in hand, may
further appear.

1. If works going before justification be excluded from being any cause
thereof; then much more those works which follow justification: for causes do
not use to follow after, but to go before their effects, at least, in order of
nature. 2. The question concerning justification by works, must of necessity
be understood of good works: for of those which are not good, no question
ought to be made. But works done before or without faith are not good. For
whatsoever is not of faith is sin: and without faith it is impossible to
please God. Neither can the fruit be good, whiles the Tree is bad. Neither can
it be imagined that a man should be justified by the works of the law going
before faith, unless it be presupposed, that a man without faith and before
grace, is able to fulfill the law. For he that does not fulfill the law
transgresses it, and he that transgresses it, is cursed, not justified by
it. 3. When the Apostle terms those works which he excludes from the act
of justification, the works of the Law, the word Law is added not by way of
extenuation, as if he spoke of such as are not good, or devised by men, but of
those good works which God himself has commanded, and to the perfect
performance whereof he has promised justification, Romans 2. 13. And life, Gal.
2. 12. Romans 10. 5. 4. The holy Ghost speaks generally of all men, whether
regenerate or unregenerate, and of all works, whether going before faith, or
follo^ing it, that a man, that is, every one, who is justified, is justified by
faith without the works of the law, Romans 3. 28. that a man is not justified
(that is, that no man is justified) by the works of the Law, Gal. 2. 16.
but by the faith of Jesus Christ, for by the works of the Law no flesh, that
is, as the Psalmist Psalm. 143. 2.
speaks, no man living shall be justified. Gal. 2. 16. For as in the first
act of justification we are justified by faith without respect of works; so
our justification is continued unto us without respect of our works. And this
appears most plainly in the examples of Abraham, of Job, of David, of Paul,
etc. as I showed before Lib. 4. c. 8.. 15.
who, though they abounded with good works which they wrought by faith, Heb.
11. 8, 9. ^7.
yet were not justified by them, but by faith only. For that which Chrysostom
says of Abraham, is also verified of all the godly: for, says he, that a man
having not works should be justified by faith, it is no unlikely thing: In
Romans 4. 1. hom. 8.
(...), but this, that a man flourishing in good works, should not thereby be
justified, but by faith, it was wonderful, and very much sets forth the
force of faith. 5. When the Apostle excludes works from justification, he
cannot be understood to exclude them from the first justification only of the
Papists, for that as themselves teach is merely habitual, consisting in the
habits of grace. Now it is a senseless thing to imagine, that the Apostle
would so seriously labor to prove, that habitual Justice is not actual, or
that good works are no part of habitual righteousness, nor do concur to
habitual justification.
. XII. Notwithstanding Bellarmine will prove that good works only going before
faith are excluded, first, out of Romans 4. 4. To him that works the reward is
not reckoned of grace, but of debt. N^w, says he, such only are those which
are wrought by the strength of free will: for to works done by grace, that
which is given is not simply merces, wages, but grace also, yea grace rather
than wages.

Answ. First, the meaning of the Apostle is this, to him that fulfilleth the
Law whether it be by strength of nature, or by help of grace, if any such
were, to him the reward of justification and salvation would be due by Gods
covenant, Do this, and live. But to him that fulfilleth not the Law (which was
the case of Abraham, and still is the case of the best) but believes in him
that justifies the ungodly (such as he does judge himself to be in himself)
he is justified gratis, or of grace, his faith being imputed unto him for
righteousness without works: this place therefore proves justification by
faith without works.

Secondly, this assertion of Bellarmine is confuted both by other Papists, and
by himself also in other places. For first there is no rewards due to him that
fulfilleth the condition of the covenant, that is, to him that fufilleth the
whole Law, for he that does not fulfill the Law does transgress it, and to him
that transgresses, not reward but punishment is due. But to hold that a man
before or without grace is able to fulfill the Law, is mere Pelagianismes.
Again, all men before or without grace are wicked sinners, and to such no
reward is due but punishment. M^ritis impii (says Augustine) non grati^, sed
poena debetur. Secondly, the Papists and namely Bellarmine himself teach, that
to works of grace proceeding from Charity the wages of eternal life is as
due, as the promised hire to the workman; and that by works of Charity men
do merit, and that condignely, not only ratione pacti by reason of the
covenant, sed etiam ipsius operis for the worth of the work it self: and yet
forsooth the wages of their merit must be counted grace when the very place
alleged does teach that the wages which is of debt is not of grace.

. XIII. Secondly, from the scope of the Epistles to the Romans and to the
Galatians, which was to persuade men, that without the faith of Christ neither
the Jews by the Law, nor the Gentiles by their Philosophy could be justified
or saved. Which is untrue. For the Apostle writes not to unbeleeving either
Jews or Gentiles, but to Christians, who were already persuaded of that truth.
Neither was there ever any believing Jew, who held, that they might be
justified by the works of the Law without faith, neither any believing
Gentiles, who thought that by their moral works they might be saved without
faith. That question therefore the Apostle does nowhere dispute. But whereas
many of the believing Jews being zealous of the Law, and many of the believing
Gentiles being misse-led by the Jews were persuaded, that they were to be
justified not only by faith in Christ, but also by the observation of the Law
that is to say by a righteousness inherent in themselves, and to be performed
by themselves: The Apostle therefore shows, that the righteousness, whereby
we are justified, is the righteousness of God, Romans 1. 16, 17. 3. 21.
and that neither Jews nor Gentiles are justified by inherent righteousness
which is prescribed in the Law, to which end he proves at large in the three
first chapters of the Epistle to the Romans, that both Jews and Gentiles were
sinners, and therefore were not to be justified by inherent righteousness,
which is the observation of the Law, but were to be justified freely by the
grace of God through the redemption which is in Christ, by or through faith
that is to say, by the righteousness of Christ both active and passive
apprehended by faith. This righteousness of Christ is that righteousness of
God by which we are justified which is revealed in the Romans 3. 21.
Gospel as being the principal argument thereof, Romans 1. 17. for so the
Apostle says, Romans 3. 24.
that we are justified through the redemption that is in Christ: that we are
justified by his blood, Romans 5. 5. reconciled to God by his death, verse. 10.
and constituted or made just by his obedience, Romans 5. 19. Of the scope of the
Epistle to the Galatians I am shortly to speak. But Bellarmine in his whole
disputation impudently perverteth the Apostles scope, as if the question, which
he disputes, were not this: Whether faith do justify without works, which
every where he affirmatively concludes; but whether works do justify
without faith, which the Apostle never mentioned nor meant; though Bellarmine
makes him to conclude it negatively, viz. that works without faith do not
justify. And to this scope he makes the whole discourse of the Apostle to
aim. By this Sophistical trick Bellarmine seeks to avoid the force of the
Apostles arguments, as if he concluded not against them, we conclude that a man
is justified by faith without works; but thus, we conclude that a man is not
justified by works without faith, neither the Jews by the works of the Law,
nor the Gentiles by their moral works without faith as if with faith they did
justify. And this he makes to be the Apostles meaning, that works done
before or without faith do not justify; but proceeding from faith, they do
justify: and so is not ashamed to make the Apostle to contradict himself. But
the Apostle does constantly teach, that a man is justified by faith without the
works of the Law; by faith, and not by works, and makes such an opposition
between faith and works in the question of justification, that if we be
justified by the one, we are not justified by the other Romans 4. 3, 4, 5. 16.
Romans 11. 6.
for if by faith, then of grace; and if of grace, then not by works; or if by
works, then not of grace. It is therefore a most shameless and Antichristian
perverting of the Apostles doctrine, to make him teach that works proceeding
from faith do justify, and that we are justified both by faith and by works:
when he plainly teaches the contrary.

CHAP. III. Bellarmines answers to the forenamed places of Scripture refuted.
. I.

FRom these three things thus premised, Bellarmine De iustif. l. 1. c. 19.. Ex
his.
says, it will be easy to answer all those places which were alleged. And
first to Romans 3. 27. he shapeth His answer to Romans 3. 27.
an answer, unto which I have sufficiently replied before; saving that here
he adds, that not all glorying is excluded, but only, that which arises
from such works as are only done by the strength of ^ man's own freewill. And
that he proves, because the Apostle says, Ubi est gloriatio tua, Where is
thy boasting? that is, that boasting whereby thou gloriest in thy self, and
not in the Lord. Whereunto I reply: that the word tua thine is not in the
original. And if it were, yet that glorying whereby thou do glory, though it
be in the Lord, though in the grace and favor of God, though in thy works
proceeding from grace, is thy glorying. As the Apostle says, this is our
glorying even the testimony of our conscience, etc. 2 Cor. 1. 12. and 1 Cor. 9.
15. it were better for m^ to dye, than that any man should make my glorying
void. 1 Cor. 15. 31. By our rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord.

. II. The second testimony recited by Bellarmin^, was from the His answer to
the second testimony, Romans 4. 2. from the example of Abraham.
example of Abraham, Romans 4. For if Abraham, who was a most excellent precedent
of faith and obedience, and is propounded as a pattern for the matter and
form of justification, was not justified by his works, which proceeded from
his faith; but notwithstanding that he abounded with works of grace, he was
justified by faith without works: then all the faithful in like manner,
though abounding with works of grace proceeding from faith, are not justified
by their works of grace, but are justified by faith without works: but the
antecedent is evident by the testimony of the Apostle, therefore the consequent
is a certain truth.

Bellarmine answers, that Abraham was justified by faith, not by works going
before faith, because they could not be truly just, unless it were in
respect of external righteousness: and therefore if he had been justified by
them (which he could not have been, unless they were truly just) he should
have had glory, but with men, not with God. But when we reply, that Abraham at
that time, whereof the Apostle speaks, that he was justified by faith and not
by works, and that righteousness was imputed unto him without works, was a
man regenerate excelling in the grace of faith and abounding in good works
which he wrought by faith: And therefore when he denies him to be justified
by works, he plainly teaches, that the faithful are not justified by works
proceeding from faith, but although they abound with works of grace proceeding
from their faith, yet they are justified by faith without works.

To this unanswerable argument taken from the example of Abraham, Bellarmine
frames two answers, but such as men use to make when they are brought to a
mere nonplus. First, he says, that Abraham indeed at that time, whereof the
Apostle speaks, was regenerate, and through faith wrought many good works:
Notwithstanding the Apostle, when he says that he was justified by faith and
not by works, does not reject his works wrought by faith; but affirms, that
they were not wrought without faith, because if they had been such, they would
not have justified him. Therefore he excludes the works which Abraham might
have wrought not by faith.

. III. Where Bellarmine first takes that for granted, which the Apostle
Bellarmines first answer refu^ed.
professedly disputes against, and concludes the contrary: namely that
Abraham was justified by works. As if the meaning of the Apostle, when he
argues, that Abraham was justified by faith without works, had been this;
that he was justified by works, but yet such, as were not without faith.

Secondly, he inverteth the question, and perverteth the disputation of the
Apostle for the mainetenance of his own error. As if the question were not,
whether faith do justify without works, which the Apostle affirmatively
concludes: but whether works do justify without faith: which question the
Apostle does not once mention, which I desire the readers to take notice of.
For if the question which the Apostle disputes, be not this, whether works do
justify without faith; but this, whethe^ faith does justify without works,
then are the Papists evidently confuted by the disputation of the Apostle.

3. He supposes that faithful Abraham endued with abundant grace, might do
good works without faith, and without grace: and that the Apostle excludes
such works, not which Abraham did, but such as the might have done, but did
not. For it is certain that the faithful, as when they sin through
infirmity, doing that evil, which they would not do, may say with the Apostle
Romans 7. 17. Not I, but sin that dwells in me: so when they perform any
good work they may say with the same Apostle, 1 Cor. 15. 10. Not I, but the
grace of God which is with me.

4. It is against sense to make the Apostle dispute that Abraham was not
justified by such works as he might have done, but did not: but more senseless
when he makes the Apostle to dispute that Abraham was not justified by his
sins. For how does he prove that they who have faith may work sometimes
without faith? by two instances, as namely, first, when they sin. As if the
Apostle had said, though Abraham were a faithful man, yet some works he might
do not of faith, as namely when he sinned (for sins are not of faith) and by
such works he was not justified. And the like is his second instance, when
they do works purely moral without relation to God, for such, if they be not
of faith, are sins. But these moral duties in the faithful, because they are
not works of the flesh, must needs be the fruits of the Spirit, Gal. 5. 19.
21. and although perhaps performed to men, yet are done in obedience to God.

5. Neither does the Apostle distinguish betwixt Abraham's works, as if he
were justified by some, and not by others; but in general denies him to have
been justified by any works at all. And that he proves because his faith
was imputed for righteousness. As if he had said: to whom faith is imputed
for righteousness, he is not justified by works: to Abraham faith was imputed
for righteousness, therefore Abraham was not justified by works. The
proposition is thus proved: to him that works, that is, to him that
fulfilleth the Law, righteousness is not imputed or reckoned of Grace, but of
debt. But to him that works not, that is, that does not fulfill the Law, but
believes on him that justifies a sinner (as all are and as he acknowledges
himself to be) who therefore can merit nothing but punishment, his faith is
counted or imputed for righteousness.

6. By this example of Abraham, Bellarmine is notably confounded in two other
respects.

. IV. For first, whereas justification before God is but one, wherein
Bellarmine confounded in two respects. The first.
the Lord by imputation of Christ's righteousness to a believing sinner, does
absolve him from his sins, and also accepts of him as righteous in Christ,
not only in the first moment of justification, wherein being a sinner in
himself he was first constituted righteous in Christ: but also in the
continuance of justification; wherein the believer, being still a sinner in
himself, is continued in the favor of God by the merits and intercession of
Christ: and though a sinner in himself, yet believing in him, that justifies
a sinner, is made the righteousness of God in Christ. Bellarmine
notwithstanding makes two justifications, the first, wherein a sinner is made
righteous by infusion of habitual righteousness: the second, when a just man
makes himself more just by the practice of actual righteousness, that is to
say, of good works (which two are degrees of sanctification, and not of
justification) and says, that the Apostle in the Epistle to the Romans
speaks only of the former, wherein works going before faith are excluded
from the act of justification. So that in Bellarmines conceit, when the Apostle
says, that a man is justified by faith without works, his meaning is, without
works going before justification. But what the Apostle speaks of other men,
he affirms of faithful Abraham, at what time he was a man regenerate, as
Bellarmine consesseth, and abounded with good works, which as the same Apostle
testifies, Heb. 11. 8. etc. he wrought by faith. And yet of him the Apostle
says, that he was justified by faith and not by works; that the Lord imputed
unto him righteousness without works; that his^ justification or blessedness
consisted in the remission of his sins, and imputation of righteousness: and
being a sinner in himself, as all mortal men are, he was in Christ the
promised seed made blessed through faith. By the example of Abraham therefore
we learn first, that that distinction of justification is forged. For Abraham,
as when he first believed was justified by faith without works: so
afterward, when he abounded with good works he was justified by faith and
not by works. And undoubtedly if ever any man attained to the second
justification which the Papists ascribe to works, Abraham had it then, when
the Apostle affirms that he was justified without works. Secondly, that
works are excluded from justification, not only those which go before faith,
but also those that follow, and are wrought by it.

. V. The second respect: when Bellarmine endeavors to reconcile The second
respect.
the seeming difference, between the Apostle Paul Romans 3. and 4. and Saint
James Chap. 2. he says, that Paul speaking of the first justification, says,
that a man is justified by faith without works, namely going before
justification: but Saint James speaking of the second justification, says,
that a man is justified by works and not by faith only.

But both the Apostle use the example of Abraham for the proof of their
assertion: Paul proving that a man is justified before God by faith without
works, demonstrateth his assertion by the example of Abraham; who, though he
were most fruitful of good works, yet he was justified by faith without
works. And as Abraham was justified, so are all the faithful. Saint James,
concluding that a man is justified, that is declared and known to be just by
works, and not by profession of faith only; proves also his assertion by the
example of Abraham, who demonstrated his faith by his works. By which though
he were declared and known to be a just man, as Saint James says; yet by them
he was not justified before God, but by faith only, as Saint Paul teaches.
This example therefore of Abraham does prove, that the Apostle Paul does not
speak of the first justification which is habitual, nor of works only going
before justification, for Abraham was a man long before regenerated and
justified, and his works were such as he wrought by faith. But that this is a
false and counterfeit distinction of justification it may further be proved.
For if this be true, that the Apostle excluding works from justification,
speaks of the first justification, which they say is merely habitual, then
the Apostle must be thought to^ have taken all these pains to prove, that to
habitual righteousness good works do not concur, or that habitual
righteousness is not actual, which needs no proof. And again if only
works going before grace be exculded from justification, then the Apostle must
be thought to have ^boured seriously to prove, that we are not justified by
such works, as are not good: which needs no proof, for how should a man be
justified by that which is not just? This example therefore of Abraham is as
Chrysostom speaks (...), abundant matter of much victory, wherein we may
truly and seriously triumph.

. VI. Bellarmine second answer is, that the Apostle speaks with condition;
Bellarmines second answer refuted.
if Abraham was justified by works not proceeding from the grace of faith, as
they thought who to their own strength attributed righteousness: then surely
he had glory, but not with God. And because it is evident enough, that Abraham
had glory even with God: thence he gathers, that he was not justified by
works without faith, but by faith from which good works truly proceed: he
should have said, by works which proceed from faith, if he meant to contradict
us: for we do confess, that he was justified by faith from which good works
did proceed; but withal we say, that he was justified by his faith and not by
his works.

But in this senseless answer of Bellarmine, there are many absurdities: for
first by incredible impudency he takes for granted, that which the Apostle
disputes against, namely that Abraham was justified by works, viz. such
works as proceeded from faith: secondly, he perverteth the question, as if
the Apostle disputed, that Abraham was not justified by works without faith,
or not proceeding from the grace of faith, as they forsooth thought, who to
their own strength attributed righteousness. As though either Abraham had any
good works which did not proceed from grace, or the Apostle would busy
himself to prove that he was not justified by such as he had not, or as if the
justitiaries among the Jews did attribute righteousness to their own
strength, when the Pharisee himself, Luke 18. 11. gave thanks to God for it,
or as if they thought that Abraham's righteousness proceeded from his natural
strength; when they knew, that God did choose Nehem. 9. 7.
Abraham, and by his preventing grace called him out of Ur of the Caldeans,
where Ios. 24. 2.
they served other gods. Thirdly, he does again contradict the Apostle, in
saying that Abraham had glory with God, which the Apostle plainly denies: the
word in the original is (...), which signifies not glory, but glorying or
boasting. If Abraham, says the Apostle, was justified by works, then had he
whereof to glory or to boast: but he had no cause to glory or to boast before
God. Fourthly, his contradicting of the Apostle makes against himself. For if
Abraham had been justified by works done without grace, he had more cause to
glory and that before God, than if his works proceeded from grace. For in that
case it might have been said to him: what have thou, which thou have not
received? And if 1 Cor. 4. 7.
thou have received it, why do thou glory or boast, as if thou had not
received it? whereas therefore the Apostle denies, that Abraham had whereof to
glory before God, he is to be understood, as speaking of his works proceeding
from grace; by which if Abraham had been justified, he had whereof to glory,
but not before God. But being justified by faith without works, all matter of
glorying was taken away. By what Law? of works? No, but by the Law of Faith,
Romans 3. 27. For by grace we are justified and saved, not by works, lest any
man should boast, Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. And that this contradiction makes against
himself, appears further by that which himself says. excludi.
in the same Chapter out of Romans 4. 4. But unto him that works the reward is
not imputed according to grace, but according to debt. Whence he proves, that
by works which the Apostle excludes from justification, he means such
works, whereto not grace is given but wages rendered. And such are only those,
says he, which are wrought by the only strength of free will. For to the
works which are wrought by grace, that which is rendered is not simply merces
wages, but it is also grace, yea grace rather than wages. If therefore Abraham
had been justified by works done by the power of his own free will, and not
by grace, he might have gloried, that he had made God a debtour unto him. But
to Abraham his faith was imputed unto righteousness, and therefore his reward
was of grace and not of debt. For to him that works, that is, fulfilleth the
Law of God, the wages is not reckoned of grace, but of debt, as being due
ratione pacti in respect of the covenant, Do this and thou shall live. But to
him that works not, that is, that fulfilleth not the Law, (which the Apostle
makes to have been Abraham's case) but believes on him that justifies the
ungodly, his faith is counted for righteousness, Romans 4. 4, 5.

. VII. And this also confuteth the doctrine of the Papists concerning Merit
confuted.
the merit of good works proceeding from grace: unto which Bellarmine here
says the reward is not rendered as of debt, but only to such as are wrought by
strength of nature. But he and his fellows, when they treat of merit, ascribe
to works of grace merit of condignity. In respect whereof the reward of
eternal life is due unto them in justice, not only in respect of Gods promise
or covenant, but even in respect of the works themselves. For every good work
proceeding from charity absolutely deserves, as they teach, eternal life:
insomuch that heaven is no less due to the good works of the faithful, than
hell to the sins of the wicked.

. VIII. As to the example of Abraham, so to these three places, Gal. 2. 16.
Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. Tit. 3. 5. wherein all works of all men are generally excluded
from the act of justification, Bellarmine answers that in them all those
works only are excluded, which are done before faith. But we will speak of
them severally.

And first to that Gal. 2. 16. Bellarmine says, that in that Epistle there are
two questions handled: the former special, whether the ceremonies of the Law
do belong to Christians, so that without them they cannot be saved. The other
general, whether by the Law and strength of Nature justification can happen to
any man without grace and without the faith of Jesus Christ. Unto both which
the Apostle answers negatively. And afterward he says, that the state of
the Question in that Epistle is, whether works do justify without faith.

Whereunto I reply, that no such question is mentioned in that Epistle, nor the
contrary concluded; as being altogether heterogeneous, and besides the purpose
of the Apostle, which was to reclaim the Galathians from their error: who
thought that besides faith the works of the Law must concur to
justification. For both the false teachers, Act. 15. 5.
who seduced them were Christians, who, lest they should suffer persecution for
the Cross of Christ, persuaded them to be circumcised, Gal. 6. 12. and the
Galathians themselves, who were seduced, did not cease to be Christians,
neither were they persuaded to renounce the faith of Christ, but were made to
believe, that unto their faith in Christ they were necessarily to join the
works of the Law, that by them both they might be justified. Against this
assertion the Apostle disputes directly, proving that a man is justified by
faith, and not by the works of the Law. But if he had disputed against the
other, that works without faith in Christ do justify, or that works done by
the knowledge of the Law only by the strength of nature do justify without
faith in Christ; his disputation had been to no purpose. For the Galathians
and their Teachers would in their own defense have answered, that they did not
from justification exclude faith in Christ, (God forbid!) but did add unto
faith the observation of the Law, desiring (as the Papists now do) to be
justified not by faith alone, but both by faith and works together. And
therefore as in the Epistle to the Romans, so here, the question is not,
whether we be justified by works without faith in Christ (which asser^ion
never any Christian held) but whether by faith without works, which the
Galathians and their teachers would have with faith to concur unto the act of
justification. To which purpose call to mind the words in the very place
alleged. We says the Apostle, speaking of himself and Saint Peter knowing
that a man is not justified by the works of the Law, but only See l. ib. 6.
c. 8.. 7. n. 2.
by the faith of Jesus Christ, even we have believed in Jesus Christ, that we
might be justified by the faith of Christ, and not by the works of the Law.
For by the works of the Law shall no flesh be justified. For if the faithful,
such as Peter and Paul, be justified by faith, and not by works: then are
they justified without works: Neither do the works of the faithful concur
unto their justification.

. IX. But for all this Bellarmine will prove, that in the Epistle to
B^llarmines argument from the consequences in the epistle to the Galatians.
the Galathians, the works only done without faith are excluded from
justification, by certain consequences, which the Apostle infers, which,
says he, are most strong against works done without faith but most weak
against works wrought by faith.

That they are strong against the works of nature, I do confess: but that
they be weak against justification by works of grace, they being equally
strong against all, I do deny. For the Apostle when in the question of
justification he excludes works, does not distinguish of works, whether
proceeding from nature, or from grace, as if by the one we were justified, and
not by the other; but generally excludes all even those, which are commanded
in the Law of God, thereby meaning all inherent righteousness whatsoever, even
charity it self which is the 1 Timothy 1. 5.
end of the Law, and proceeds from faith unfeigned. For the Law is a perfect
rule of all inherent righteousness, whencesoever it proceeds. Neither are
the Papists able to produce any one place of Scripture, wherein the Apostle,
either affirms, that we are justified by works proceeding from grace; or
propounds this question to be disputed, whether works do justify without
faith: but even whether faith does justify without works; always concluding
the affirmative, that we are justified by faith without works; thereby,
teaching, that works do justify before God, neither without faith, nor yet
with it,

. X. For the better understanding of this needful point worthy That the
consequences make against justification by works of grace.
to be insisted upon, and for the satisfying of Bellarmines objections, wherein
he pleases himself; we are to take notice, that there are two ways to life
eternal, which God has propounded to man: the one in the state of innocence:
the other, after his fall. The former, was the covenant of works, or of
inherent righteousness to be performed by himself; the Sacrament whereof was
the Tree of life. But when man had broken this covenant and was fallen from the
state of integrity, into the state of disobedience and corruption, it being now
not possible that he should be justified or saved by inherent righteousness,
according to the covenant of works: the Lord therefore in his infinite mercy
and love of mankind made with man, being now a sinner, the covenant of grace in
the promised seed; that whosoever truly believes in him (though in himself a
sinner, as since the fall all are) should be justified and saved by his
righteousness. The faith in this covenant concerning the justification of
sinners and salvation by Christ, was professed from the beginning after the
promise was once made, by all the Patriarchs and ancient believers, who had
testimony that they pleased God, Heb. 11.
and by faith in the Messiah wrought those things which were pleasing to God,
which without faith in Christ they could not have done. And it was represented
and figured in the sacrifices, which were types and figures of Christ's
sacrifice, even from the Genesis 4. 9.
beginning. And the same was afterward confirmed by Sacraments: viz.
Circumcision which was ordained to be a seal Romans 4. 11.
of that righteousness which is by faith: and the passover, which was a type
of Christ our passover, 1 Cor. 5. 8.
who is immolated for us; and prefigured by the propitiatory, which covered the
Arc, in which were the two tables of the Law; by the Scape-goate, which did
bear away the sins of the people, by the high Priest, who was a type of
Christ in many respects; but most plainly by the brazen Ioh. 3. 14, 15.
Serpent, etc. But lest men should either through ignorance, or pride neglect
the benefit of the Messiah, and consequently their own salvation, which is the
common corruption of all natural men; it pleased the Lord to renew the
covenant of works, by publishing the Moral Law: not with purpose that any
should by the obedience thereof be justified or saved which Bellarmine himself
De justis. l. 4. c. 4 di^fer. 6. Lex Mosis non erat data, ut justificaret, sed
ut mo^ bum ostenderet, and ad qu^rendum medicum excita^et.
confesses: but partly that to natural and unregenerate men it should be a
Schoolmaster unto Christ, discovering unto them their own damnable estate in
themselves, both in respect of their sins, and of the curse belonging unto
them for the same, that so they might be forced to seek for salvation out of
themselves in Christ: and partly, that to men regenerated and justified it
should be a rule whereby to frame their lives, and as it were a counselor
and a guide to direct them in the way, which God has appointed them to walk
in toward our country in heaven.

. XI. Those therefore which looked to be justified by the observation All the
consequences alleged by Bellarmine are strong against justification by works
of grace.
of the Law, as the Galatians were taught by their false teachers, were in a
pernicious error: both because none can be justified by the obedience of the
Law, all men without exception being sinners, and subject to the curse: and
also because there is such an opposition between these two covenants in the
matter of justification, that to be justified according to the Covenant of
works by inherent righteousness, is a disanulling of the covenant of grace:
which cannot be disanulled in it self, though to him that seeks to be
justified by works, it is made void, as the Apostle proves, Gal. 3. and
therefore with him I say, Gal. 3. 17, 18.
that if justification be by the works of the Law whatsoever, then the covenant
of grace is disanulled and made void, then is the promise made of none effect,
then Christ died in vain, Gal. 2. 21. then is the inherent no more of promise,
Gal. 3. 18. but faith is made void, and the promise made of none effect, Romans
4. 14. then men are made debtours to the whole Law, and consequently Christ is
become of none effect to them. And finally, they that seek to be justified by
the Law are fallen from grace, Gal. 5. 2, 3, 4. according to all the
consequences alleged by Bellarmine. From when I argue thus.

To them that are debtours to the whole Law, Christ is become of none effect,
to them the covenant of grace is disanulled, and the promise made of none
effect, etc.

They that seek to be justified by the works of the Law, that is, by
righteousness inherent whatsoever, whether before or after grace are debtours
to the whole Law.

Therefore to them that seek to be justified by righteousness inherent,
Christ is become of none effect, etc.

The proposition is thus proved: Those that are debtors to the whole Law are
subject to a double yoke of most miserable bondage opposite to the liberty of
justification: the former, in that they are to be subject to the fearful
curse of the Law, if at any time they transgress it, though in the least
degree, as we do very often, and sometimes in an high degree: the other, to
be excluded from justification, if they do not ^otally perfectly and
perpetually fulfill it, which by reason of the flesh is utterly impossible to
us. Now Christ came to free us from this double bondage of the Law, himself
being made a curse for us, and performing all righteousness in our behalf,
that by the imputation of his sufferings and of his obedience, we might not
only be freed from the curse, but also be entitled to the Kingdom of
heaven. And therefore to him that remains under this double yoke of bondage,
Christ profits nothing. I come to the assumption: those that seek to be
justified by the works of the Law, that is, by righteousness inherent, are
debtours to the whole Law; for neither are they free from the curse, if they
break it, as all do. And therefore the Apostle concludes Gal. 3. 10.
them who are of works, that is, who seek justification by righteousness
inherent, are under the curse. Neither can they be justified, unless they
perfectly keep it. Therefore they, who seek to be justified by the works of
the Law, that is by inherent righteousness whatsoever, whether going before,
or following grace, to them Christ is become of none effect, to them he dyed in
vain, to them the covenant of grace is disanulled, to them the promise is of
none effect, etc. So that whether you conceive of works as going before, or
following grace, the consequences of the Apostle are one and the same.

. XII. Indeed if the popish doctrine were true, that Christ has Christ has
not merited for us that we should be justified by our own righteousness, or
saved by our own merits.
merited for us the infusion of that righteousness by which we are justied, as
he has done that by which we are sanctified, and that he has merited for
our works to make them meritorious of eternal life: then those consequences
would not be so strong against the works of grace, as of nature. But the
Scriptures teach us, that Christ does justify and save us, by his blood and by
his obedience, that is by his own personal righteousness and merits, and not
by any satisfaction of ours purchased by him, nor by any merit of ours by him
made meritorious. For if his satisfaction and merits for us be full and
perfect, what need we to patch to them the rags of our own satisfactions and
merits? But if that were the end why Christ died for us, that we by his merits
should obtain both inherent justice whereby we should be justified, and also
merits of our own whereby we should be saved, as the Papists teach: then,
either that righteousness and those works which we have by grace, are
sufficient to justify and to save us, or else Christ died in vain for us. But
neither is that inherent righteousness, which we have from Christ sufficient
to justify us, nor those good works of grace which we perform sufficient to
merit eternal life, as I have in this treatise abundantly proved; neither did
Christ dye in vain, for that to imagine were blasphemy. Therefore that was not
the end why Christ our Savior died for us. I say again, if Christ dyed to
this end, that he might merit grace for us, whereby we might in our own
persons satisfy the Law, and so be justified thereby; then he merited not
only that we should perfectly and perpetually without any omission or
intermission in all our life fulfill the Law, and be always and altogether
without sin, which by reason of our sinfulness is utterly impossible, we
having been sinners from the womb, yea in the womb: but also that we should
in our own person^ satisfy the penalty, which cannot be done but by
punishment eternal, or that which is equivalent, for where has been guilt of
sin, as in all has been, there the Law cannot be satisfied without the
punishment threatened in the Law. And therefore if this were the end of Christ's
death, it must be confessed, that he died in vain: but this consequent is
Blasphemous, and therefore the antecedent is Antichristian.

. XIII. To the fourth place which is Ephesians 2. 8, 9. Bellarmine His answer
to Ephesians. 2. 8, 9.
vouchsafes no several answer, but sleights it over with that common
answer, that it excludes only works done before faith.

But this place ought not so to be slighted. For it does ex professo teach,
that salvation and all the degrees thereof, as namely justification, are to be
ascribed wholly to the grace of God in Christ through faith, and not to any
works or deserts of ours whether going before or following justification. For
first, it may seem needless, that the Apostle should tell the Ephesians, whom
before in the same Chapter he had convicted to have been before their
conversion children of wrath as all are by nature, dead in sin, bondslaves of
Satan, living according to to the course of this world in all manner of sin,
until God in his abundant mercies in Christ (by whose grace they were saved)
quickened them together with Christ: that he I say should tell them, that they
were not justified by the works which they had wrought before their
conversion. Secondly, when the Apostle says, you are saved by grace and not by
works, will they say he excludes only works going before salvation? why
then he excludes all. And that distinction with which Bellarmine contenteth
himfelfe, as a sufficient answer, cannot be fitted to this place. If it be
said, that the Apostle by Salvation means justification. I confess that
among the degrees of Salvation he does specially mean justification, whereby
we receive the right to our inheritance Tit. 3. 7.
, and are entitled to the kingdom of heaven, and saved in hope. But from hence
it is inevitably proved, that by what we are justified, we are saved; and by
what we are saved we are justified. But we are saved, as the Apostle here
says, by the free grace of God through faith, not of any works of ours
whatsoever, or whenever performed: therefore in the like manner we are
justified. What then? will you say, if we be neither justified by good works
nor saved for them, are they therefore to be neglected? I answer in the third
place, that good works, though they be excluded from the act of justification,
or merit of salvation: yet they are not excluded from the conversation of the
faithful, but are therein required, as necessary fruits of our regeneration
and consequents of our justification, as also being the way, wherein we are to
walk toward our glorification. As the Apostle shows in the next words,
verse. 10. for we are, says he, Gods wo^kemanship created in Christ Jesus unto
good works, which God has preordained, not that we should be justified by
them, or saved for them, but that we should walk in them, as the way to
eternal life: where we are to observe that those words being a prevention of a
secret objection, viz. if we be not justified by good works nor saved for
them, are they therefore to be neglected? No, says the Apostle, they that are
justified are the workmanship of God created unto good works, which God has
prepared, that we being justified and regenerated should walk in them. And
therefore the Apostle speaks manifestly not of works going before grace, but
of such good works as are consequents of our justification and fruits of our
regeneration, wherein we being regenerated and justified are to walk, as in
the way, to our glorification.

. XIV. The next place, viz. Tit. 3. 5. which is like to the former, Bellarmine
shifteth off with the like common answer, that it speaks of works going
before faith. But he may not carry it so. For the Apostle having (as he had
done, Ephesians. 2.) signified, that all of us before our conversion lived in all
manner of sin: But after that the kindness and love of God our Savior to
man appeared: not by the works of righteousness which we have done, but
according to his mercy he saved us, etc. Where as in the former place he
uses the phrase of saving, unto which, as I said, Bellarmines distinction
cannot be fitted. And secondly, the works which he excludes, he does
expressly call the works of righteousness: which term cannot agree to the
works of such men as the Apostle describes verse. 3. and such are all men
unregenerate.

. XV. The sixth and last testimony whereunto Bellarmine answers His answer
to Phil. 3. 8, 9.
is, Phil. 3. 8, 9. Where the Apostle in the question of justification
renouncing his own inherent righteousness, which not only he had in his
Pharisaisme, but which then he had according to the Law, desires to be found
in Christ, having that righteousness, which is through the faith of Christ.
Bellarmine answers, according to his distinction formerly used, that by the
righteousness which is of the Law are meant works done through the knowledge
of the Law by the only strength of nature: which I have before confuted.
Neither would Paul make any question of his justification by his works done
before his conversion. For before his conversion, notwithstanding his
Pharisaicall pro^ession of righteousness, he does confess, that he was a
blasphemer and injurious, and of all sinners the chief 1 Timothy 1. 13, 15. And
whereas Chemnitius objecteth that Paul rejects, not only his works before
his conversion, which he si^nifieth speaking in the time past, ver. 7. (but
what things were gain unto me I counted loss for Christ but also the works
of his present condition, which he notes, speaking in the present tence, and
using particles of amplification (...), yea, doubtless, and ^ do count all
things but loss, etc. As if he should have said, nay, more than that, I even
now do count all things as loss, -- and I do count all but as dung etc.
Bellarmine answers, that as the Apostle in the beginning of his conversion
had counted them loss, so he did still. But if the Apostle had spoken of the
same works, whereof he spoke ver. 7. the amplification used verse. 8. would
have been but an idle repetition, and the exposition which we give, was long
since delivered by In locum.
Chrysostom. The Apostle, says he, having said, these things (...) I counted
loss for Christ, he says, (...) yea, that which is more I do count all
things loss, (...) he said all, both past long since and also present.

. XVI. But here Bellarmine thinks he has Chemnitius at a great advantage, as
if he had spoken blasphemy, for saying that the Apostle calls his works
done after his calling (which were the fruits of the Spirit, and for which he
expected a reward 2 Timothy 4. 7. even a Crown of righteousness, etc.) (...)
dung. Whereunto I reply: in the question of sanctification we do highly
esteem of good works: but in the question of justification, if they shall be
obtruded as the matter, by which we stand just before God, by which we are
both freed from hell and entitled to heaven: if affiance or trust be put in
them for our justification before God, then, seem they never so glorious, they
are to be esteemed as things of no worth, yea, as loss. And in the like
cause, as has been showed, the godly Esa. ^4. 6.
have compared their most righteous works to menst^uous clouts. And in this
sense Chemnitius Exam. council. Trid. part. 1. de jus^if. page 135.
speaks, that the Apostle quod attinet ad articulum justificationis did thus
speak of his works done after his renovation. Immo says he, si fiduc^
justitiae cor am Deo ad vitam aeternam illis operibus assua^ur, pronunciat ille
esse stercora and detrimenta, But if the word (...) translated by the vulgar
Latin stercora offend Bellarmine, he may translate it quisquilias, as Hierome
Advers. Pelag. l. 2. omnia pro Christ^ ducit quisquilias.
does meaning thereby things of no value, such things as use to be cast to
Dogs, or* Swine, according to the notation of the word. For as Suidas says
(...) or as others, (...) I. Scapula.
that which is cast to swine. And from hence is the verb (...) which
signifies Hesyc^ius.
to be rejected as a thing of no worth. Chrysostom and Theophylact upon the
place, by (...) understand (...) chafe. Photius, (...) straw or stubble. But
He^ychius expounds it by (...) dung. I conclude, as Bellarmine does against
Chemnitius; Eat nunc Bellarminus and queratur, etc. Let him complain that we
are enemies to good works, because in the question of justification, when men
trust to them to be justified before God by them, and so make Idols of them,
which the holy Ghost calls Deos stercoreos; Gill^lim. Deuteronomy. 29. 17. Ezekiel. 22.
3.
we esteem them not only as things of no ^alew but also as loss.

. XVII. To these testimonies I added others out of the same His answer to Romans
3. 24.
Chapters or Epistles, no less pregnant than these, unto which more might be
adjoined, as Romans 3. 24. being justified freely by his grace, which text
affords two arguments, from the words gratis and gratia, From the former I
argue thus:

Those that are justified freely ( gratis) are justified without works. All
the faithful are justified gratis, freely. Therefore all the faithful are
justified without works. The assumption is proved out of the text. The
proposition, because the word gratis is so expounded by all sor^s of Writers,
both old and new, both protestants and Papists, gratis, id est, si^e ^ueribus,
sine meritis, as I have showed heretofore Lib. 3 de gratia.
Gratis, says (...), quia nihil ^perantes, nec vicem reddentes, sola fide
justificati sunt d^ne Dei, by which words he excludes all works, as well
following after, as going before. Oecumenius (...). thou art saved freely
without any good works of thine, which words exclude all merits, as well from
salvation, as from justification. And so do those words of the Apostle, Ephesians.
2. 8, 9. Tit. 3. 5. To avoid this evident truth De justif. l. 1. cap. 21.
Bellarmine coyneth a twofold distinction. First, that the word gratis may be
understood, as opposed to merits of condignity, going before justification: and
so it excludes not the dispositions and preparations, which the Papists teach
go before justification which according to their doctrine, are but merits of
congruity. But it is evident, that not only merits of condignity, but all
merit whatsoever, yea and all respect of our own worthiness and well doing is
excluded: so that gratis is as much as without any cause in us, or any desert
of ours, or worthiness in our selves. And thus the council of Trent Sess. 6.
cap. 8.
it self expounds this word. We are therefore said to be justified gratis
freely, because none of those things which go before justification, whether
faith for works, deserve the grace of justification: for if it be grace, then
is it not of works: for i^ it were of works, then grace were not grace, as
the same Apostle says, Secondly, says he, it may be understood as opposed to
our own merits or good works done without grace, for those that proceed from
grace, are not opposed to grace, and therefore not excluded.

Whereunto I reply: we cannot have any good thing but by gift from God: and
what good thing we have from God, that is called ours, as our faith, our
Charity, our Hope, our good ^orkes: Neither can we without grace merit any
thing but punishment. It is therefore absurd to understand the Apostle as
excluding merits without grace, when as if we should do all that is commanded
(which cannot be done without grace) we must confess that we deserve not so
much as thanks, because we have done but what was our duty to do. Neither can
we be said to be justified gratis if there be any meritori^us cause of
justification in our selves, though received from God In regard of our selves
indeed we are justified gratis: but it is not gratis in nor without paying a
great price in respect of Christ. And therefore to those words justified freely
by his grace, is added, through the redemption which is in or by Christ. By the
word gratis therefore the Apostle signifies tha^ in us there is no material
cause, no merit of justification, but only in Christ. And where he says that
grace cannot be opposed to grace: I say it may, as in that opposition which is
of relatives, as of the cause and the effect. For the effect cannot be the
cause of its own cause, and therefore works which are the fruits and effects of
justification cannot be the causes thereof.

The other argument is from the word grace. For if our justification be of
grace, then not of works, as the Apostle teaches, Romans 11. 6. and if of
works then not of grace. So Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. you are saved by grace not of
works. For to him that works, the reward, that is, justification or
salvation is not imputed of grace, but it is rendered as of debt, but to him
that works not, but only believes in him that justifies the ungodly, his
faith is imputed, namely of grace, to righteousness, Romans 4. 4, 5. Even as
David also describes the blessedness of the man, unto whom God imputes
righteousness without works, verse 6.

CHAP. IV. Bellarmines arguments proving the necessity of good works: and
first, from the difference between the Law and the Gospel: Secondly, from the
Doctrine of Christian liberty. Bellarm. de iu^tif. l. 4.

. I.

NOW I come to Bellarmines arguments concerning Bellarmines Method.
good works: which, when he should prove they concur to justification as
causes thereof; he proves them to be consequents thereof, rather than causes.
And having little to say to the question it self, he intermingleth many
impertinent discourses. Impertinent I say to the question, though not to his
purpose: which was to calumniate us, as though we held all those assertions,
which he labors to confute.

In his fourth book therefore, which is de justitia operum, he propounds two
maine questions to be disputed, unto which diverse others are coincident. The
former, concerning the necessity of good works; the other, concerning the
truth of them. As if we, either denied that good works are necessary or that
they are truly good. To the former, he refers three questions: the first,
whether the faithful are bound to keep the Law of God: as though we taught,
they were not: the second concerning the difference between the Law and the
Gospel, as if we taught that the difference stands in this, that by the Law
good works are necessary, by the Gospel not. The third concerning Christian
liberty: as though we taught, that the faithful in their conscience and before
God, are subject to no Law.

Concerning the truth of the righ^eousnesse of good works, after he has
disputed the question, whether the Law be possible, whether the works of the
righteous be sins: he comes at length to handle the controversy it self,
whether good works do justify or not. Concerning the former questions, it
shall suffice to show, what our tenet is in every of them; and to defend our
assertions against his cavils, ^o far as concerns this present controversy
of justification by works, passing by the rest as impertinent. As touching
therefore the first principal question which concerns the necessity of good
works: the Reader will bear me witness by that which before I have delivered,
that we hold good works necessary in many respects, and that we urge the
necessity of them by better arguments than the Romish doctrine does afford: we
confess, that they are necessary, necessitate presentiae for persons come to
years, that are already justified, and are to be saved: as necessary
consequents of justification, and as necessary forerunners of Salvation only
we deny them to be necessary necessitate efficientiae, as causes either of
justification or Salvation.

. II. That good works are necessary to Salvation (which we deny He proves
works necessa^y, not to iusti^ication, but to salv^tion.
not) Bellarmine greatly busied himself to prove: but that they are necessary
to justification, as causes thereof, (which is the question between us) for
ought that I can discern, he goes not about to prove in his whole discourse of
the necessity of good works, wherein he spends nine Chapters. For after he
had in the first Chapter calumniated us, as if we denied good works to be
necessary to Salvation: in the Chapters following he proves they be
necessary, because as he propounds his proofs in the Argument of his book,
we are bound to keep the Law of God. And that he proves by discussing the
other two questions concerning the difference betwixt the Law and the Gospel,
and concerning Christian liberty. But by these arguments Bellarmine neither
proves his own assertion, nor disproveth ours. His assertion is, that good
works do concur unto justification as a cause thereof, which we deny. He
argues they be causes: why? because they are necessary. As if every thing that
is necessary were a cause. But whereto are they necessary? to salvation, says
Bellarmine. Why, but the question is of justification. Now many things are
required to salvation, which do not concur to justification, as namely Romans
10. 10.
confession, Heb. 12. 14.
holiness of life, He^. 10. 36.
patience, Matthew. 10. 22. and 24. 13.
perseverance, etc. which, though they go before salvation; yet they follow
after justification; and therefore cannot be causes thereof. In all this
discourse therefore Bellarmine is far from concluding the point in question.

Notwithstanding it will not be unprofitable: if I shall make a short excursion
to follow him in his discourse, but not to answer every particular, which is
not worth the answering. That therefore he may confute our most pernicious
error as he calls it, De justif. l. 4. cap. 2.
he says he will prove three things: first, that in the Gospel is contained
the doctrine of works and diverse Laws, and that the promises thereof require
the condition of fulfilling the Law: Secondly, that the just are not free from
the observation of the Law of God: Thirdly, that good works are simply
necessary to Salvation.

. III. His intent in the first is to disprove that difference, which Of the
difference between the Law and the Gospel.
we make between the Law and the Gospel: from whence he had collected in the
former Chapter, that we deny the necessity of good works. The difference was
this: That the Law propounds justification and salvation upon the condition
of our fulfilling the whole Law. But the Gospel promises justification and
salvation upon the condition of faith only; excluding works as the causes, by
which we are justified, or for which we be saved: which difference if it be
true, as it is most true, plainly proves justification by faith only, and
disproveth justification by works.

For the better understanding whereof, we are to distinguish the The
acceptions of the words Law, and Gospel, either in a large or strict sense.
terms both of the Law and Gospel: which are used sometimes more largely,
sometimes more strictly and properly. More largely Thorah the Law signifies
the whole doctrine of the old Testament, whether written and contained in the
books of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms; or Preached. Written; thus it is
said to have been written in the Law, Ioh. 10. 34. which is written, Psalm.
82. 6. so Ioh. 12. 34. which is written Psalm, 110. 4. so Ioh. 15. 25. which is
written Psalm. 35. 19. The Law says those things, Romans 3. 19. which are cited
out of the Psalms, and out of the Prophet Esaias, verse. 10, 11, 12. Thus 1 Cor,
14. 21. out of Esai. 28. 11. thus Gal. 4. 21. out of Genesis 21. 10. And thus by
the Law in many places Psalm. 1. 2. and 19. 7. Psalm. 119. 18, 72, 142. Mic. 4.
2. Esai 2. 3.
is understood the whole doctrine of God contained in the Scriptures of the old
testament, and is often used in the same sense promiscuously g with Gods word;
insomuch that the Septuagints sometime translate Dabar Psalm. 119. 57, 104.
which signifies the word, by (...). Preached, as Esai. 30. 9, 10. Psalm. 78.
1. Ier. 18. 18. Prove. 28. 9. and 29. 18.

In this large sense the Evangelicall promises made in the old testament are
contained in the Law, though properly belonging to the Gospel, as De iustif. l
4. c. 2. probator quarto.
Bellarmine confesses: the promises of remission of sins though they be in
the Prophets, they do not belong to the Law, but to the Gospel. And so the
covenant of grace it self, which the Lord made with Genesis 22. 18.
Abraham, in making whereof he is said, Gal. 3. 8. to have preached before the
Gospel to Abraham. Of the Doctrine of the Gospel (which was to begin at
Jerusalem, Luke 24. 47.) it is said Esai. 2. 3. and Mic. 4. 2. out of Sion the
Law shall go forth. So more largely the Gospel is taken for the whole
Doctrine of the new Testament, whether written by the Apostles and Evangelists,
or preached Mark. 13. 10. Romans 10. 16. Gal. 2. 5, 14. Ephesians. 6. 19. Col. 1. 5.
Phil. 1. 27. 2 These. 1. 8. Thus the histories of the life and death of CHRIST
are called Gospels, Mark. 1. 1. Mat. 26. 13.

Preached, Romans 2. 16. and 16. 25. 1 Cor. 4. 15. and 9. 18. Gal. 2. 7. 1 These.
1. 5. and 2. 4. 2 These. 2. 14. 2 Timothy 2. 8. In respect of this large sense it
is truly said, that the Precepts, Promises, and Comminations of the Law are
contained in the Gospel.

of works, which is also called the Law of works, Romans 3. 27. which upon
condition of perfect and perpetual obedience promises justification and
salvation to the observers thereof, Romans 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12. Levit. 18. 5. Ezekiel.
20. 11. Act. 13. 38. Romans 3. 20, 28.

Likewise (...), the Gospel which imports Luke 2. 10. Romans 10. 15.
good tidings signifies more strictly and properly the Covenant of Grace,
which is also called the Law of faith, Romans 3. 27. and the word of faith, Romans
10. 8. which freely promises justification, and right of salvation to all that
believe in Christ, Ioh. 3. 15, 16, 36. and 6. 47. and 11. 25. and 20. 31. Act.
16. 31. Romans 3. 24. 10. 6, 9. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. Tit. 3. 5. 1 Ioh. 5, 13. This
doctrine of God concerning Salvation by Christ through faith, which properly is
the Gospel, Luke 4. 18. Matthew. 11. 5. Romans 1. 16, 17. Act. 15. 7. Gal. 1. 6.
and 3. 8. Act. 10. 36. is called the Gospel of grace, Act. 20. 24. the word of
reconciliation, 2 Cor. 5. 18. the Gospel of peace, Ephesians. 6. 15. the Gospel
of salvation, Ephesians. 1. 13. the Gospel of glory, 1 Timothy 1. 11. the Gospel of
the glory of Christ, that is the glorious Gospel of Christ, 2 Cor. 4. 4. the
Gospel of the Kingdom, Matthew. 4. 13. and 24. 13. This doctrine teaches us,
that our gracious God out of his mere grace having elected his children in
Christ before all times, did in the fullness of time send down his Son to
save us: and that the benefit of the Messiah might be applied unto us,
vouchsafes unto us the Gospel of grace, by which according to the purpose of
his grace given unto us in Christ before all secular times, 2 Timothy 19.
he calls us working in us the grace of faith: being endued with faith he
imputes unto us the righteousness and merits of Christ, making us partakers
of redemption, reconciliation, justification, and adoption, and so freeing us
from hell: and from all the enemies of our salvation, he entituleth us unto
the kingdom of heaven. And that we may be fitted and prepared for his
Kingdom into which no unholy thing may enter, Apoc. 21. 27. he has promised
to them that believe, that being redeemed, reconciled, justified, adopted, and
so entitled to the kingdom of heaven, he will give them grace to worship him
without fear in holiness and righteousness before him all the days of our
life, that is, in the voluntary, upright, and constant obedience of his Law.
Luke 1. 73, 74, 75.

It is true, that the things which God in this Covenant of grace has promised
to give, as namely faith and new obedience, are also required of us Deo dante
quod jubet, God giving to us what he requires of us: the one, as the
antecedent condition whereby we are entitled or have right to his kingdom,
being saved in hope: the other as the consequent and fruit Romans 6. 22.
of the former, whereby we being entitled to Gods kingdom, are prepared and
fitted for it: without which, though none who are adulti are saved, Heb. 12.
14. yet none are saved by it, or for it; it being the way to the kingdom, but
not the cause of it, nor the title that we have unto it: and therefore
necessary, as I have said necessitate presentiae, as causa sine qua non, but
not necessitate efficientiae as any true or proper cause thereof.

. V. These things thus premised, it will be easy to answer Bellarmines His
disproofe of the difference which we assign.
arguments taken from the difference between the Law and the Gospel to prove
the necessity of good works. And they are two: the former disproving the
supposed false difference, the other proving the pretended true. As touching
the former: having first propounded an idle distinction of the diverse
acceptions of the word Gospel, that it signifies either the doctrine which
Christ and his Apostles taught, or the grace of the new Testament, which is the
quickening Spirit, or the efficacy of the holy Ghost working in the hearts of
the elect, or the Law written in the heart, (which I therefore call idle,
because as soon as he has propounded it, he confesses, that the word Gospel
in the Scripture does never signify any other, but the Doctrine) he proves,
that in the Gospel is contained the Doctrine of good works, and diverse Lawe^,
diverse comminations and diverse promises made upon condition of good works.

All which we do confess to be true as the word Gospel is taken in the
larger sense. But as those promises and Doctrine of grace contained in the
Books of the old Testament, did not belong to the Law properly which is the
covenant of works, but to the Gospel which is the covenant of grace: so in the
books of the new Testament, diverse precepts, comminations and promises are
contained, which belong not properly to the Gospel, which is the covenant of
grace and Law of Faith, but to the Law of works. For even as the Preachers of
the Gospel at this day, do in their preaching intermingle many things
appertaining to the Law either for the preparing of their auditors, who are
not yet justified, by the terror of the Law; or for directing those that do
believe, to lead their life according to the rule of the Law: Even so our
Savior Christ, and his Apostles in their doctrine intermixed legal precepts,
legal promises and threatenings, as the necessity of their auditors required.
But upon all this being granted, what will he infer? he says in the title of
this Chapter (though in the Chapter it self he does not express it) that from
hence is proved the necessity of good works; which we deny not. So pertinent a
disputer is this great Master of controversies.

. VI. And forasmuch as the promise of eternal life, as of a reward, Whether
the promise of Salvation made to our obedience do prove the merit of good
works.
made to our obedience, is the principal ground, whereon the Papists build
their Antichristian doctrine of the efficiencie and merit of good works, I
will endeavor to clear this point. We are therefore to understand, that
eternal life is vouchsafed to the faithful in three respects. First, as the
free gift of God without respect of any worthiness in us. Secondly, as our
inheritance purchased by Christ. Thirdly, as a free reward promised and given
to our obedience. In the first respect, our salvation and all the degrees
thereof, is wholly to be ascribed to the gracious Eternal life three ways
promised* first, as a free g ft.
favor of God in Christ. In the second, to the mercy of God and merit of
Christ. In the third to the mercies of God redoubled and multiplied upon us,
and not to any desert of ours. For as touching the first, God before the
foundation of the world was laid, of his free grace Elected us in Christ,
Epbes. 1. 6.
graciously accepting of us in his beloved without respect of any goodness in
us; whom, when he foresaw fallen into the state of perdition, ex massa perdita
humani generis did choose us in Christ, in him, and by him to be justified and
saved. And as out of his undeserved love he did choose us; so by the same grace,
whom he has elected Romans 8. 30. 10. 13, 14. 2 These. 2. 13, 14.
, he has called; whom he has called, he has justified; whom he has
justified, he has sanctified; and whom he has called, justified, and
sanctified, he has glorified, according to the purpose of his grace 2 Timothy 1.
9.
given unto us in Christ before the world began. As therefore all the degrees of
salvation are wholly to be ascribed to the grace, that is, the gracious favor
of God in Christ, (for by his grace we were elected, called, justified,
regenerated and sanctified) so also by his grace we are saved Ephesians. 2. 8, 9.
and not of works. For although eternal death be the wages deserved by sin:
yet eternal life is (...) the free gift of God, through Jesus Christ our Lord,
no way deserved by us. Romans 6. 23. This his purpose of grace God revealed by
his gracious promise to our first parents, and after to Abraham and others,
viz. that in the promised seed Genesis 22. 18.
all the Nations of the Earth should be blessed.

. VII. Now that this his purpose of grace might be put in execution, 2. As our
inhe^itance.
and this his gracious promise concerning ^he promised ^eed might be performed
to the illustration of the glory, both of his mercy and also of his justice:
God in the fullness of time, out of his infinite goodness and love to mankind,
sent his own and his only begotten Son into the world, that he, taking our
nature upon him, might not only in the state of humiliation by his sufferings
redeem us from hell, and by his meritorious obedience purchase heaven for us:
but also that in the state of exaltation he having conquered all the enemies of
our salvation in and before his resurrection, might by his ascension take
possession for us of that kingdom, which he had by his merits procured for us,
and by his sitting at the right hand of his Father might make us to sit
together Ephesians 2. 6.
with him in heavenly places, and by his coming from thence again might put
us both in body and soul in possession o^ that heavenly inheritance, which he
had purchased for us. And to the end, that the benefit of our blessed redeemer
and Savior might be applied and communicated unto us, the lord according to
the purpose of his grace 2 Timothy 1. 9.
giv^n unto us in Christ before all secular times, does in his good time call
those whom he has elected, by mini^tery of the Gospel ma^e effectual by the
gracious operation of his h^ly Spirit working the grace of faith in us, whereby
we receiving Christ with all his merits are actually made partakers of
redemption, and are actually reconciled unto God justified and adopted, and by
our justification entitled to the Kingdom of heaven, and by our adoption made
heirs thereof and coheires with Christ; insomuch that being justified by
faith, we have thereby, not only remission of sins, Act. 26. 18. T^t. 3. 7.
but also the inheritance, or at least the right and title to it: in respect
whereof it is said in the Scriptures of so many as truly believe, that we are
saved, Ephesians. 3. 5, 8. that we are passed from death to life, and that we now
have eternal life, Ioh. 5. 24. and 6. 47. 1 Ioh. 5. 12, 13. And in this
respect, eternal life is our inheritance, which Christ has purchased ^or us.
And according to this tenure, Christ will put us in possession thereof at the
last Day; when he shall say unto us, Come ye blessed of my Father (...)*
inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the beginning of the world, Matthew.
25. 34. for you, I say, who before the beginning of the world were in Christ
elected to be heirs of this kingdom, which is not to he attained unto by any
purchase or merits of ours, but shall be given us as an inheritance intended
from the beginning, and prepared for the elect, for whom Christ by his merits
has purchased it.

. VIII. Now to those, who by Gods special grace do believe 3. As a reward.
in Christ, and by faith receive him, by whom so received they are justified
and adopted, and by their justification and adoption are in such ^ort entitled
to this kingdom as heirs apparent thereof, that they are already said to be
saved, and to be set in heavenly places with Christ: to these, I say, that they
might be fitted and prepared for this inheritance, unto which no unclean Ap^c.
21. 27
thing can come; h^e has in the covenant of grace freely, and out of his
undeserved mercy promised the grace of sanctification by his holy Spirit,
whereby we are enabled, according to the measure of grace received, Luke 1*
73, 74, 75. Ier. 3* 33, 34. Heb. 8. 10, 11, 12.
to worship him in holiness and righteousness before him.

And to the end that we might be moved to perform the duties of
sanctification, he does not only in his word seconded and made effectual by
his Spirit invite by exhortations and precepts to these duties; but also that
he might encourage us thereunto, in his redoubled and multiplied mercies he
has promised not only the blessings of this life unto us, but also eternal
life it self, as a gracious reward of our piety and obedience. Here therefore
in admiration of Gods bounty toward us we have just cause to exclaim with
Augustine De verbis Domini sermon. 3. O magna bonitas Dei: cui cum pro condition
reddere debeamus obsequia utpote servi Domino, famuli Deo subjecti potenti,
mancip^a Redemptori, amicitiarum nobis prae (...), ut nobi^ obsequi^ debita
servituti^ ext^rqueat, etc.
: O the great goodness of God, to whom when in respect of our condition we
ought to render unto him the duties of obedience, as servants to our Lord and
God, as subjects to the Almighty, as captives saved to our redeemer, he does
promise unto us the rewards of friendship, that he might draw from us the
duties of service which we do owe unto him. It was of Gods free grace, that
he elected any of us, that being elected he called us, that being called and
endued with faith he justifies and adoptet^ us, and thereby gives us right
to his kingdom; it was also of his free grace, that to them, whom he
redeemeth and justifies, he has promised to bestow his graces upon them,
whereby they are enabled to serve him in holiness and righteousness and are
fitted for his own kingdom. But this is a multiplication of his grace upon
us, that to encourage us to the Practice of Piety, whereby we are fitted for
the kingdom of heaven, he does promise to reward our good works with
everlasting happiness, and in the end does crown his own blessings with
blessedness, which, though he be pleased for our encouragement to call a
reward, yet is it not deserved by us, but freely bestowed by him, as his free
gift granted unto us in Christ before all times, as our inheritance purchased
by Christ: as his bountiful reward of his own gifts, which as he freely
promises, so in his good time he freely bestows, as his (...), that is free
gift.

. IX. To this purpose let us consider the Lords dealing with The example of
Gods dealing with Abraham.
Abraham, to whom the Lord at his first coming toward the Land of promise,
made diverse gracious promises, which afterward he often repeated. But when
upon that Commandment of trial to offer up his only son, Abraham had by
Gods special grace notably approved Genesis 22. 16, 18.
his faith and obedience; hereupon the Lord does swear, that he will bestow
upon him the things which before he had promised, as the reward of that his
obedience, for so he says, because thou have done this thing, and again,
because thou have obeyed my voice. Can any man hereupon infer that Abraham by
his obedience had deserved these promises which God long before had made unto
him, and oftentimes repeated? Nothing less, so God in his eternal Counsel
has to the Elect designed eternal life, as his free gift by Christ, Christ by
his merits has purchased it to be our inheritance, God has graciously
promised to bestow freely this inheritance on them that believe in Christ: when
as therefore God does promise to reward our piety with eternal life, we may
not think that by our piety it is deserved, which God long before had decreed
and promised, and Christ our Savior had purchased for us. But though it be a
reward, yet it is a most free, and undeserved reward.

. X. When the Papists therefore object, that if eternal life be the Objection,
if eternal life be the reward of our obedience, then our obedience does merit
it.
reward of our obedience, then our obedience does deserve it: I answer, first,
thou can deserve nothing at Gods hand, by that which he has freely given,
and much less that, which he freely bestows on thee: Secondly, if thou
should do all that is required of thee, thou could deserve nothing
thereby: for where is debt and duty, there is no Romans 6. 23.
merit, Luke 17. 10. Thirdly, we do not all that is commanded but come short
of our duty, and that which we do is unperfect, and defective in respect of
manner and measure; and therefore in justice deserves punishment, rather than
reward: and consequently the reward, when it is given, is to be ascribed to
Gods undeserved Psalm 62. 12. Ephesians. 2. 7.
mercy and not to our merit. Fourthly, Sanctification, and the duties thereof
are not causes of Salvation, and therefore in serie causarum, in the chain of
the causes of Salvation, Romans 8. 30. they are left out: and where they are
mentioned, they are inserted, not as a cause of Salvation, but either as the
way unto it, Ephesians. 2. 10. or as the marks and cognizances of them that shall
be saved, or as the evidences according to which God will judge. As marks, I
say for they are occulta praedestinationis indicia futurae faelicitatis
praesagia, as De gratia and lib. arbitr.
Bernard speaks. Our Savior setting down the end of the ministry of the
Gospel says, that a man being thereby called, may by faith obtain remission
of sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified, Act. 26. 18. so also
Act. 20. 32.

. XI. And thus are we to expound many Testimonies of Scripture, Places which
the papists understand of causes, to be understood of notes.
as speaking of notes, which the Papists expound, as speaking of causes. Thus
Romans 8. 16, 17. The Spirit it self bears witness with our Spirit, that we
are the Children of God, and if Children, Heirs of God, and coheires with
Christ, who shall be glorified with Christ, if he has given us grace not
only to believe Phil. 1. 29.
, but also to suffer with him and for him, he does not say that our suffering
does make us sons and heirs of God who shall be glorified with him: but the
Spirit bears witness, that if we suffer with him, we are the sons and
heirs of God, who shall be glorified with him. So 2 Timothy 2. 11, 12. If we
suffer, we shall reign with him; if we patiently suffer, it is (not a cause,
but) a sign that we shall reign with him, Romans 8. 1. There is no condemnation
to them that are in Christ Jesus. But how shall we know, who they are that
shall be saved by Christ? that walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit:
where walking after the Spirit, is not the cause of salvation, but a sign of
their being in Christ, which is the cause. Christ is the foundation and cause
of all our happiness; and faith is the only instrument whereby we receiving
Christ are united unto him: all other graces and duties unto which happiness
any where is ascribed, as it is to many, Matthew. 5. 3. etc. Psalm. 112. 1. etc.
are but notes of our being in Christ by faith, and presages of our future
happiness. Thus in the same chapter, Romans 8. 13. If by the Spirit ye do
mortify the deeds of the body, that is, of the flesh, as the vulgar Latin
renders it, and as Paul speaks 1 Cor. 9. 27. Ye shall live. So Romans 10. 13.
Whosoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved: that is whosoever
has this grace given him unto him truly to worship God, it is an evident sign
and assurance unto him that he shall be saved, and so of the like: Ambrose In
Romans 8.
, this is the sign of justification in a man, that by that which dwells in
him he that is justified may appear to be the Son of God.

. XII. As evidences, according to which the Lord will judge. Or of evidences.
For so it is often said, that God will judge men acccording to their works.
Thus Matthew. 25. 34, 35. Come ye blessed of my Father, inherit the kingdom
prepared for you from the foundation of the world, for when I was hungry you
gave me meat, etc. this rational particle for, though it be called causall,
and the sentence, where it is used is called (...), the rendering of the cause,
does not imply a cause properly so called, but any argument or reason, as I
have showed heretofore: as here it implies an argument from the fruits, as
signs and evidences of their bleessednesse in Christ by faith. The causes of
this sentence of salvation are set down, verse. 34. First, because they are
blessed of God, that is, justified. Secondly, because elected, for whom God in
his eternal purpose has provided this kingdom. Thirdly, in that it is called
the inheritance purchased for them that truly believe in Christ, who as soon
as they believe are by justification blessed, as being entitled or having right
to this Heavenly inheritance: and this is employed in the Verb (...), inherit,
showing that they come to that kingdom by right of inheritance. Salvation
therefore is given, as a fre^ gift of God depending upon election and
justification, and as an inheritance purchased by Christ for all true
believers: and therefore not merited by them that are saved. But because God
has promised salvation to all that have true faith in Christ, which is a
secret and inward grace, and many men deceive themselves with a vain opinion
and profession of it therefore the Lord will judge of men according to the
fruits thereof: when as men therefore professing the true faith, do
demou^trate their faith by good works, and namely by the works of charity and
mercy, they give good proof of their election, whereby this kingdom was
prepared for them, and of their redemption by which Christ purchased this
inheritance for them, and of their justification, whereby, they are entitled
to this kingdom, and so are blessed of God. And therefore according to these
fruits Christ pronounces the sentence of salvation. Three other answers to
the foresaid objection.


. XIII. Wherefore to proceed in my answers to the before said objection for by
that which has been said, it appears. Fifthly, that eternal life is not
deserved by our obedience, because it is the free gift of God depending upon
Gods free election. Sixthly, because we come to it, as to an inheritance
purchased by Christ's merits, and not by ours. Seventhly, though it be a reward,
yet it presupposes no merit of ours, because it is a free and undeserved
reward, whereby the Lord out of his mere bounty does crown his own gifts. Ea
enim est Dei bonitas says learned Casaubon Ad annal. eccles. Baronii exercit.
15. n. 17.
ut beneficia gratuito in suos collata, ali^ beneficiis coronet, atque hoc
mercedem appellet. such is the goodness of God, that such benefits as he has
freely bestowed upon his children, he crowns with other benefits, and this
he calls reward, nihil tamen, says Calvin, g In Genesis 22.
quasi debitum solvens, sed mercedis titulum imponens suis beneficiis, not as
rendering any debt, but imposing the name of reward on his own benefits.

. XIV. Now let us examine the testimonies which Bellar. alleges Bellarmines
allegations de justis. l. 4. c. 2.. Ve niamu^. first, Mat. 5. 20.
wherein upon condition of obedience eternal life is promised. The first is
Matthew. 5. 20. unless your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the
Scribes and Pharisees ye shall not enter into the Kingdom of heaven: which
words contain directly a threatening and not a promise, for he does not say,
if your righteousness do exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and
Pharisees (which was but external and in outward show) ye shall enter into
the Kingdom of heaven: but if it do not, which argues that internal
righteousness is necessary to salvation necessitate (...), as causa sine qua
non, but does not prove it to be so necessitate efficientiae. And so do other
threatenings, Heb. 12. 14. Luke 13. 3. Matthew. 25. 42. 1 Cor. 6. 9. Gal. 5. 21.

. XV. The second testimony is Mat. 19. 17. If thou will enter into His second
testimony.
life, keep the commandments. Where a rich man being a justitiray, as many of
the Jews Romans 9. 32.
were, ( quia Au^tor operis imper^ecti in Matthew. hom. 33.
omnis spes sal^tis apud Iudaeos in Mat. 19 17.
operibus erat non in fide) taking it for granted, that by his works he must
be saved, but not satisfied (as justitiaries never are, but ever remain
doubtful and uncertain of their justification, as we see in the Papists) I
say, not satisfied with all that obedience which he had performed from his
Verse. 20.
youth up; but finding, that something still was lacking, he comes to our
Savior to know, what good Stapleton in promptuar. cathol. Dominica 1^. post
pentecost* quaerebat, quid sac^endo, id est pe^ qu^ (...) opera it maeternam
(...).
works those were, by doing whereof he might be saved. Good Master, says he,
what good thing shall I do, that I may inherit eternal life. To him our
Savior fitteth his answer, and first to confute his error, and to let him
understand, that no man living, who is but a mere man, can be justified by
inherent righteousness: he tells him, that no man is good, that is purely
and perfectly just: and therefore reproves him, for that he, thinking our
Savior to be but a mere man, as others were, did call him good. But in the
second place, to answer his question, he tells him, that if by his own
works he did hope to be saved, he must do those works which God himself
had commanded; and so refers him to the Commandments of the Law, of which
God himself had said, do this and thou shall live, which is the legal
promise, Levit. 18. 5. Romans 10. 5. Gal. 3. 12. Thus our Savior fi^teth
according to the Law his answer to the disposition of the party, who was a
justitiary. But ot^erwise, when our Savior and his Apostles were a ked the
like q^estion, they made answer according to he doctrine of the Go^pell. For
our ^aviour being asked, Ioh. 6. 28. what shall we do that we may do the
works of God; answered verse. 29. This is the work of God, that which he
esteems in stead of all works, that ye belee^e in him whom he has sent:
for he that believes has fulfilled the Law, Christ being the and of the Law
to every one that believes, Romans 10. 4. And the Apostle Paul, being demanded
of the Iaylour, what must I do to be saved? answers, believe on the Lord
Jesus Christ, and thou shall be saved, Act. 16. 30, 31.

. XVI. In the third place he alleges testimonies, out of the doctrine His
other testimonies answered.
of the Apostles, viz. Romans 8. 13, 17. 2 Timothy 2. 11, 12. Iam. 2. 8. 2 Pet. 1.
11. 1 Ioh. 1. 9. Apoc. 3 21. Answ. The place cited out of S. James is no
promise, but a commendation: if you fulfill the royal law, ye do well. Of
Romans 8. 13, 17 and 2 Timothy 2. 11, 12. I spoke before. Supra.. ^.
But concerning them and all others that are or may be alleged, there is a
distinction of conditions to be held: that either they import the cause of the
thing promised, which is sal^ation or happiness, or the proper marks and
cognizances of such as shall be saved or are happy, which do not show propter
quid (...) sunt, vel servandi* sed qual^s beats sunt, quales servandi. Christ
our alone Savior is the only cause of salvation, and the only foundation of
our happiness He is eternal life, 1 Ioh. 5. 11, 12, 20.
and whosoever has him has life eternal. Faith is the only instrument,
whereby we receive Christ: and therefore to it also is salvation ascribed, in
respect of the object, which it does receive As when it is said thy faith has
saved thee, it is to be understood, as if it were said, Christ received by
faith has saved thee. A condition therefore of receiving Christ by faith or of
Christ received by faith betokens Heb. 5. 9.
the cause: but all other conditions, either of graces, or of works, do not
signify the cause of salvation, but the proper marks and cognizances of those
which shall be saved. And therefore prove, that the marks a^e, or may be
necessary by the necessity of pres^nce, but not by necessity of efficiencie.

. XVII. And this also may se^ve to answer his fou^th and fifth arguments. His
argument from Ezekiel. 18. 2^.
His fourth is fetched from the Doctrine of the Prophets. Ezekiel. ^8. 21 If the
wicked shall turn from all his sins, that he has committed, and shall keep
all my statutes and do that which is lawful and right, he shall surely live.
That is, if he shall turn from the wrong way into the right, and go on
therein (as sin is an aberration, and the error Iam. 5. 20.
of his way) he shall come to the end of his way, which is salvation. So that
this condition is not the cause, but the way. Yea, but says Bellarmine, in the
same place to turn from righteousness and to break the Commandments of God
is a condition, upon which depends the commination of death, for if a
righteous man turn from his righteousness and commit iniquity he shall surely
die. Therefore, as the turning from righteousness unto sin is the cause of
death: ^o the turning from sin to righteousness is the cause of life. I
answer, that there is not par ratio. there is no equality be tweene the sin
of the wicked, and the righteousness of the godly. Death is the due Romans 6. 23.
wages of sin, and sin is the meritorious cause of death. But eternal life
is the free gift of God, and not merited by our righteousness. Sin is of
infinite demerit, and so deserves death eternal. But not the obedience of any
man, but only of Christ, if it did merit at all, ^s, or can be of infinite
merit to deserve eternal life. The sins of ^he wicked are purely and
perfectly evil: but the righteousness of the re^enerate is not purely and
perfectly good. The sins of the wicked are their own works wholly
proceeding from themselves, and to themselves the wages thereof is wholly and
properly to be ascribed and imputed: the good works of the regenerate proceed
from Gods free grace: and therefore when they are rewarded, God crowns his
own graces in them, and not their merits.

That which he babbleth concerning promises absolute and conditional, as if we
held all the promises of the Gospel to be absolute, is a shamlesse and
senseless cavil. We are so far from saying, that they be all a^solute (as
if indifferently and without condition they promised salvation to all,) that we
rather say they are all conditional. But we distinguish of conditions, that
some are from the cause, as where the condition of faith is interposed, and
such conditions, we do hold to be necessary necessitate efficientiae: some
from other arguments, and such are necessary only necessitate presentiae.

. XVIII. His fifth argument is taken from the condition of His fifth argument
from the condition of faith.
faith, which we do not deny to be contained in the Evangelicall promise. Now
says he by what words the Scripture requires the condition of faith, by the
same, or more clear, it teaches the condition of fulfilling the Law to be
required. Answ. The condition of fulfilling the Law is required no where but in
legal promises; and is a condition by reason of the flesh impossible. But in
all these promises which he cites, excepting that Matthew. 19. 17. not the
condition of fulfilling the whole Law is required, but of some special duties,
between which and the condition of faith is great odds. For faith, relatively
understood, that is, Christ received by faith, saves alone, it alone
entituleth us and gives us right to salvation. Ask of any particular duty to
which salvation is promised: will invoc^tion Romans 10. 13? will suffering, Romans
8. 17? will any other duty or grace save a man, or entitle him to salvation? No
one part of righteousness, though it may be a proper mark of them that shall
be saved can save a man. But faith, that is, Christ received by faith saves
alone. Thus much may suffice to have answered his former Argument, in defense
of that difference, which we make according to the Scriptures, between the
Law and the Gospel, in respect of justification.

. XIX. His other argument to prove the necessity of good works Bellarmines
proof from his pretended true differences.
(which we deny not) is taken from his true pretended differences betwixt the
Law and the Gospel: whereof he sets down two principal, and six secondary
differences arising from the principal. All of De justif. l. 4. cap. 3.
them impertinent to the matter in hand, excepting the first, and also the
last, which serves to confute the first is, that such is the difference
between the Law and the Gospel, as between a doctrine begun and perfected
for as in respect of the mysteryes to believed and the promises to be hoped
for, the Gospel excels the Law ((...) should have said the new Testament
excels the old, for of the the two Testaments that is, of the Law and the
Gospel largely and not strictly taken, this difference is to be understood) so
also in respect of the precepts, which are to be done. For to omit the
ceremonial and judicial Laws, which he impertinently mentions, he says,
that the Law and the Gospel have in a manner the same moral precepts, but with
this difference, that in the Gospel some more heavy or weighty things are
imposed upon Christians, tha^ were in the Law exacted of the Jews, as in the
matter of polygamy and bills of divorce (which not withstanding by the moral
Law were as much forbidbed to them, as now to us) Secondly, that Christ did
perfect the moral Law, prescribing a more perfect righteousness, than the Law
required. Thirdly, that to the precepts he has added Counselles tending to
perfection? Answ. This difference is suitable to the rest of their wicked and
Antichristian doctrine, which in this whole treatise I confute, whereby as they
confound justification and sanctification; so also the Law and the Gospel:
saving that in the Gospel they say greater perfection is required of inherent
righteousness to justification, than the Law prefcribeth: and so make it a Law
of works as much or rather more, than the Law it self.

. XX. This is confuted by the eigth or last difference, wherein The first
diffe^ence confuted by the last.
he truly says that the Law of Mose; was most heavy and unportable: but the
Gospel of Christ is an easy yoke, Mat. 11. 29.
and a light burden. If Petor therefore exclaimed against those, which sought
to impose the Law of Moses upon Christians Act. 15. 10. what shall we think
of our Popish Rabbis that impose an heavier yoke, than the Law it self. For
whereas Bellarmine says, the Gospel is the easier, because of the grace of
the new Testament accompanying it: yet the difference is to be understood in
respect of the doctrine it self, and the letter, which if it req^ire more
perfect obedience, is in it self the heavier burden.

II. This difference, by confounding the Law and the Gospel, does make void
the covenant of grace, which God made with Abraham, and performed in Christ:
which was concerning Justification by faith, which as it could not be
disannulled Gal. 3. 17.
by the Covenant of works: so much less was it repealed, but renewed and
ratified in the Gospel. But if in the Gospel were taught justification by
works and not by Christ's righteousness apperhended by faith, the Covenant of
grace made with Abraham should in the Gospel be repealed, rather than renewed.
For the covenant of works promises justification and life upon condition of
perfect and perpetual obedience: the covenant of grace, upon condition of
faith. And these two, in the Article of justification are (...) incompatible.
If therefore the Gospel do teach justification by works, it makes void the
covenant of grace, and thus the popish gospel overthrows the Gospel of Christ.

Thirdly, This difference overthrows a maine benefit, which we have by
Christ, and without which we can neither be justified nor saved, which is this:
that he has freed us from the rigor of the Law, which stands in an exaction
of perfect righteousness to be inherent in us, and perfect obedience to be
performed by us unto the acceptance either of our persons or actions, which by
reason of our corruption is impossible unto us. And therefore miserable is their
estcate, who are in bondage to the Law, either subjecting them to the curse, if
they offend in the least degree, when in many things we offend all: or
excluding them from justification and salvation, if they yield not perfect and
perpetual obedience, which by reason of the flesh is impossible. From this
curse Christ has freed us in being made Gal. 3. 13.
a curse for us, bearing the punishment due for our sins: and from this
exaction of perfect righteousness to be performed by our selves, he has
freed us in being made unto us of God 1 Cor. 1. 30.
righteousness, Ier. 23. 6.
even Jehovah our righteousness, performing perfect obedience to the Law for
us. But if the Gospel, which they call the new Law, require more perfect
obedience, than the old Law unto justification and salvation: then do we
continue in that miserable estate, neither does our blessed and most perfect
Savior avail us any thing. Neither will this free us from this bondage, that
with the new Law the grace of the new Testament, whereby we should be enabled
to obey the Law is conferred. For first, it is conferred only to those, who
are already justified: and secondly, to whom it is conferred, it is not given
in such perfection in this life, but that ever they are sinners in themselves,
sin always abiding in them. So that still, if we must be justified by no
righteousness but that which is inherent in us, we remain in that fearful
bondage: seeing we have nothing, either to free us from the curse in respect of
our former sins, or to entitle us to the kingdom of heaven; our best
righteousness being unperfect, and stained with the flesh.

Fourthly, the righteousness required in the new Law to justification, is either
the same with that, which was prescribed in the old Law, or more perfect. If
the same, how then are we not justified by the works of the Law? If more
perfect, then the Law of God was not perfect; which the Scriptures testify to
be so perfect, as nothing can be added thereto. Neither did our Savior Christ
perfect the Law by adding more perfection unto it, in respect either of the
precepts, or the counsels, which the Papists conceive to have bin added by
Christ to the precepts. For as touching the precepts: he did but more perfectly
explain them, freeing them from the depravations of the Scribes and Pharisees,
who rested in the outward letter, as if the Law were not spiritual, nor did
forbid any more, but the gross sins, which in the (...) of the Law are
expressed. And as for the Counsels; they are also moral duties for omission
whereof men may according to the sentence of the Law be condemned, as not to
love our enemies, not to forbear swearing in ordinary talk, not to give a
man's goods to the poor, and to follow Christ, when he is thereunto required.
Mat. 19. 23. Mar. 10. 23. These things are so manifest, that Bellarmine De
justif. l. 4. cap. 4.
in the end of the next Chapter does confess them viz, that our Savior does
not say, except your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the Law and
the Prophets, but of the Scribes and Pharisees, to signisie that his meaning
was not so much (he should say not at all) to add to the burden of the
precepts, as to take away the corruptions of the Scribes and Pharisees. And
again, those things, which seem to be most heavy in the new Law, are to be
found in the old, as the loving of our enemies, the restrayning of
concupiscence, and such like. For proof whereof he quotes Augustine lib. contr.
Adimant. cap. 3. and lib. 19. contr. Faustum c. 28. In the former place
Augustine says, Nulla in Evangelica atque Apostolica disciplina reperiuntur
quamvis ardua and divina precepta, and promissa, quae illis etiam libris
veterib. desint. In the latter, Vel omnia, vel pene omnia, quia monuit s^u
praecepit (Christus) ubi adjungebat, Ego a. dici vobis, inveniuntur and in
illis veterib. libris. And so much of the first difference.

. XXI. The second difference is, that the Law comes alone, but The second
difference.
the Gospel is accompanied with grace. Which is not a difference of the
doctrine and letter of the Gospel from the Law, but of the covenant of grace
from the covenant of works. For in the covenant of grace, as justification is
promised to them, that being called do believe: so sanctification to them,
that are justified. Which as it proves the concurrence of Good works with
faith in the party justified, as consequents thereof: so it excludes them from
being any causes of justification. But as touching this second difference two
popish errors are to be avoided. First, in respect of the covenant of works.
For though that covenant does not promise, nor afford the grace of
sanctification, whereby a man should be enabled to perform the covenant, which
grace is promised in the covenant of grace, and given to them that believe; yet
we are not so to conceive, that they who lived in the time of the law were
void of grace, nor all that live under the Gospel, are endued with grace. For
the covenant of grace has always been in force from the beginning: so that to
the faithful, who believed in the Messiah which was to come, the grace of
sanctification was given, according to the covenant of grace, so that in the
old Testament, even under the Law, there were as excellent examples of
holiness, as have been in the time of the new, under the Gospel. So also the
Law has its use, even among those that live under the Gospel, insomuch that
until men do believe, they are under the Law, and not under grace. Secondly,
in respect of the grace of the new Testament: that it is not promised in such
perfection in this life, where we receive but the first fruits Romans 8. 23.
of the Spirit, as that we may expect to be justified by it, or saved for it.
The other 6. differences.


. XXII. From these two difference the rest, as he says, arise, viz. from the
first arise the third, the fourth and the fifth. The third is this, that the
Law of Moses was given to one Nation; the Law of 3
Christ, to all Nations. The fourth, that the Law of Moses, for the most 4
part contained shadows and figures of things to come: the Gospel exhibiteth
the body and truth. The fifth, that the Law of Moses, because it was not
perfect, was to be changed by the Law of Christ: but the Law of Christ was 5
not to be changed by any succeeding Law.

These three differences of the Law do not agree to the Law Moral, which
belongs to all nations, which did not consist of shadows and figures, which
was not to be changed, no not by addition, because it was, and is, a perfect,
immutable, and perpetual rule of righteousness. The other three, viz. the
sixth, seventh, and eigth arise, as he says, from the second. The sixth, that
the Law of 6
Moses had no power to justify, neither was it given, that it might justify;
but that it might show the disease, and stir up men to seek the physician.
But the Law of Christ, that is, the Gospel has power to justify, and was
given to that end. For as he alleges out of Romans 1. 16. it is the power of
God to salvation to every one that believes, (he does not say that works.)
For therein is revealed the righteousness of God from faith to faith, as it is
written, the just man shall live by faith. This is a true difference of the Law
of faith from the Law of works: but agrees not to Bellarmines new Law, which
is a Law of works, as well as the old, containing the very same moral
precepts with the moral Law; in 7
the observation whereof not our justification but our sanctification
consists, prescribing also the same righteousness viz Charity, which is the
sum of the Law. The seventh, that the Law of Moses is a Law of
fearefullnesse, and bondage: but the Gospel, the Law of love, and of liberty,
which is true. For the obedience of men, who are under the Law, is forced by
the terror and coaction of the Law working servile fear in them. But the
obedience of men, who are under grace, that is of men justified, is voluntary
and cheerful proceeding from faith, and from some measure of assurance of Gods
love and favor to them in Christ. Therefore this voluntary obedience is no
cause, but a consequent of justification, not only before God, but also in the
court of our own conscience; that is, not only of justification it 8
self, but also of the assurance thereof in some measure. Of the eigth, which
confuteth the first, I have already spoken.

. XXIII. So much of the first thing which Bellarmine undertook Of Christian
liberty.
to demonstrate for the proof of the necessity of good works (which we hold
as well, and urge as much as he.) Now follows the second; which is to prove,
De justif. l. 4. ^ap. 5.
that the justare not free from the observation of the Law of God. For he
says that we place Christian liberty in this, that we are not subject in our
conscience and before God, to any Law, and that the decalogue it self does not
belong unto us. Which is a most devilish slander. We profess, that we (so
many as truly believe) are by Christ freed from the curse of the Law; from the
rigor and exaction of the Law requiring perfect righteousness in us unto
justification; from the terror and coaction of the Law; from the irritation of
the Law, as I have showed in my treatise of Christian liberty; but not from the
obedience of it. For freedom from obedience is the servitude of sin. But we
being freed from sin Romans 6. 18.
become the servants of righteousness. And we do freely profess, that by how
much we have received the greater favors from God in redeeming us, and
bringing us into the liberty of his children, in freeing us from sin, and
from the yoke of the Law: by so much the more are we bound to obedience; not
to be justified, or saved by it, but to testify our thankfulness, and to
glorify God, who has been so gracious unto us, etc. Much more might be said
concerning Christian liberty, but this is as much, as is pertinent to the
question in hand. If any desire to be better informed in this point, I refer
them to my treatise of Christian liberty, which I published many yea^es ago.

CAP. V. That good Works are not necessary by necessity of Efficacy.
De ius^if. l. 4. c. 7.
. I.

ALL this while Bellarmine, as we have seen, has wandered from the question;
but now, he says, he will come nearer unto it. For now he will prove the
necessity of good works, not only by way of presence, but by w^y of
efficacy. But to what will he prove them necessary? to justification? no such
matter. But yet that is the question, which he ought to prove if he will
disprove justification by faith alone; that good works do concur to
justification, as causes thereof. For though they were (as they are not) causes
of Salvation: yet it is manifest, that they are consequents, and therefore no
causes of justification. So that Bellarmine, though he be come nearer the
question, yet he is not come home to it. But perhaps it will be said, that
Bellarmine prevented this objection, when he first Deiustif. l. 1. c. 18..
Simile.
propounded this, as his fifth principal argument to prove, that faith does
not justify alone, because good works are necessary to Salvation. His
argument may thus be frarned. If faith did justify alone, then it would save
alone: but faith does not save alone without good works, which are necessary
to Salvation in those that are come to years. Therefore faith does not
justify alone without good works, which are so necessary to Salvation etiam
hominibus justificatis, even to them that are justified, that without them
faith alone does not save. Answ. The proposition is denied; first, by
Bellarmine himself: who teaches, though falsely, that not all who are
justified shall be saved; when notwithstanding the Apostle says, Romans 8. 30.
whom the Lord has justified, he also has glorified. And further he holds,
that they who are justified may utterly and finally lose their justification,
though they lose not their faith: and farther, that they may also lose their
faith (which as he absurdly teaches, is lost by any act of infidelity) and
consequently, both their justification and Salvation. Yea but says Bellarmine,
their justice cannot be lost, nor their Salvation, whiles they have faith, if
they be justified by faith only. But Bellarmine himself says (though
falsely) that the faith of them, who are justified, may be lost, and with it
their Salvation: and therefore by his doctrine a man be justified by faith,
and yet not be saved by it. Secondly, it is denied by some of the Fathers, who,
though they teach, that faith alone suffices to justification (as you have
heard:) yet deny that it alone suffices to Salvation, because some other
things, as namely good works are thereunto required. To the assumption, that
says alone does not save: If such a faith be meant, as is alone, severed from
Charity and void of works: I do confess, that it neither saves, nor yet
justifies, I do not say, alone, but not at all. But if he speak of a true
lively faith in Christ, which purifieth the heart and works by love, (of
which only we speak) and understand it relatively, as we do: then I
constantly affirm, that faith in Christ alone, that is, Christ alone received
by faith, is the only meritorious cause of our Salvation: and that neither
works, nor any other graces, are causes of salvation, unless he mean
caussas sine quibus non, which are no causes.

. II. But for the further proof of his consequences, Bellarmine Bellarmines
proof of his consequence.
says, that we cannot deny them, because Luther teaches, that a Christian man
cannot lose his salvation, unless he will not believe; and that the L^therans
affirm, that salvation, as well as justification, is to be ascribed to faith
alone. Answ. We can deny, what either Luther, or those that are called
Lutherans do affirm without warrant of Gods word: therefore this was but a
slender proof. Howbeit, we do not deny that assertion of Luther, nor the
like; which, though full of true comfort, yet are most maliciously calumniated
by the Papists, as if he taught men not to care what sins they commit, so
that they can say, they have faith. Whereas Luther delivers speeches of that
kind to comfort, the distressed consciences laboring under the burden of
sin; assuring them, that although their sins be many and great, yet they
ought not to despair, if they can find in their heart to believe in Christ.
Which is most true. For though our sins be many, the mercies of God are more;
though great, yet the merrits of Christ are greater. And though the Lutherans
do say, that salvation as well as justification is to be ascribed to faith
alone; yet that is no proof of Bellarmines consequence, but a flat denial of
his assumption, which it behooves him to prove. Upon these things thus
premised, Bellarmine infers, that all the testimonies, which afterward
(namely in his fourth Book) he was to allege out of Scriptures, and Fathers,
to prove, that good works are so necessary to salvation, even to men that are
justified, that without them faith alone does not save them: do also prove,
that faith alone does not justify, which is the thing says he, which we
have undertaken to prove: which notwithstanding we do constantly deny,
protesting against this inference of Bell^mine, and affirming, that although
good works be so necessary to salvation, as that that faith which is without
them does not save a man; yet that does not hinder our assertion, that faith
does justify alone, because they do not concur to the act of justification
at all, and much less as the causes thereof, for they follow justification,
though ordinarily they go before salvation; and howsoever that faith, which is
alone, severed from charity and destitute of good works does neither justify,
as I have showed heretofore, nor save: yet notwithstanding faith relatively
understood, that is, Christ received by faith does save alone.

. III. But (to return to his fourth Book) though Bellarmine still Bellarm.
proofs sor necessity of efficiency.
do wander yet I must be content to follow him. To prove therefore that good
works are necessary to salvation by necessity of efficiency, De Iustif. Lib.
^. Cap. 7.
as causes thereof, he uses three kinds of proofs: testimonies of
Scriptures, sentences of Fathers, and reason. Out of the Scriptures hoe
produces ten testimonies, besides some whole Epistles. The first testimony
Heb. 10. 30. For patience is necessary for you, that doing His first testimony.
Heb. 10. 36.
the will of God ye may receive the promise. Here first, says he, we have the
term necessary, and that unto salvation, contrary to the Lutherans, who deny
good works to be necessary to salvation; and again we have, that patience is
necessary not only in respect of presence, but also of relation to salvation,
that they may receive the promise. Answ. He has not here the term Necessary,
but in the vulgar translation: the phrase in the original is (...) opus
habetis, you have need of patience, which phrase is often used in the
Scriptures to signify things useful or needful, without any show or color
of signification implying the necessity of efficiency, as Matthew. 6. 8. Your
father knows whereof (...) you have need, the Lord (...) has need of the
Ass and her colt, Matthew. 21. 3. Buy those things (...) whereof we have need
against the feast, Ioh. 13. 29. etc. But we grant, that patience is a
necessary virtue, and that also to salvation; yea, but It is necessary, says
he, with relation to salvation, for so he says; that you may receive the
promise. Ridiculous: for how can it be necessary to salvation without some
relation to it? But every relation is not causall, or importing a cause, as in
those examples which he alleges. Meat is necessary, that we may be
nourished, etc. But many times the relation is of other arguments, as of means
and helps and such other things without which the thing desired cannot well be
had: as the Ass and her colt were needful for Christ going to Jerusalem.
Shoes or boots are needful for him that travaileth. And such is the relation
of the way to the journies end. He therefore that would go to heaven, had
need to go the way which leads to it, that is, the way of good works, which
God has prepared for us to walk in them. And that is the meaning of this
place: ye have need of patience, as of a necessary fruit of faith, that having
by faith run the race Heb. 12. 1.
that is set before you, viz. Of patience, you may come to the end of your
faith, which is the salvation of your souls. His second testimony. 1 Timothy 2.
14, 15.


. IV. His second testimony 1 Timothy 2. 14, 15. The woman being deceived was in
the transgression. But she shall be saved by bearing of children, if she
continue in faith, and love and sanctification with sobriety. Where, says he,
perseverance not only in faith, but in faith, love, sanctification and
sobriety is put as necessary to salvation, and as a certain condition without
which the woman cannot be saved. Answ. All this we grant: but Conditio, sine
qua non, is no cause, nor does import any efficiency. If he would have taken
hold of any thing in this Text, as implying efficiencie, he should rather have
urged the phrase (...) per filiorum generationem, by childe-bearing, (as it is
better translated than by bearing of children, to avoid ambiguity, because it
is said in the words following, if they shall continue, which is not to be
understood of the children, but of the woman, that is to say, the sex, which
being a word collective, signifying a multitude, is per synthesin joined to a
verb of the plural, as turbaruunt. As if childebearing were a cause, or had
some relation of efficiency to salvation, which notwithstanding is so far
from being in it self a cause of salvation, that it was inflicted upon that
sex, as a curse. Howbeit to the faithful the nature of it, as of all other
afflictions, which in themselves be evil, is changed and they sanctified to
them, as the strait way (or as the word Matthew. 7. 14.
(...) signifies a way of affliction) by which Act. 14. 22.
they are to come to heaven. In such places therefore, though the preposition
(...), which many times imports a cause, be used: yet not the cause, but
sometimes the way is signified, and sometimes the estate: The way, as Acts 14.
22. Paul and Barnabas confirming the souls of the Disciples, and exhorting
them to continue in the faith, affirmed (...) by or through many aflictions we
must enter into the Kingdom of God. Not that afflictions, or the patient
bearing of them is the cause of salvation, as the Papists would collect out of
some other places: but that afflictions patiently borne are the way to it. The
estate: as Romans 4. 11. Abraham the father of all that believe (...) being in
uncircumcision. So in this place, as Beza has well observed, where (...) is
put for (...). And him does Bellarmine follow. This is to be noted, says he,
De Sacrament. matrim. cap. 2.. and confirmatur.
that per by the bearing of children is put for in. For it was not the Apostles
meaning that procreation of children is a cause of salvation, but that a woman
in the state of marriage or in the state of childebearing shall be saved, if
she abide in the faith. etc.

. V. His third Testimony Phil. 2. 12. With fear and trembling His third
testimony. Phil. 2. 12.
work your salvation. Surely, says he, if good actions work salvation, they
are necessary, not only by way of presence, but also of efficiency. Answ. Very
true. But where does the Apostle say, that good actions do work salvation?
He exhorts indeed the Philippians, that they should work, or rather work
out their salvation, not that they are the Authors or Workers of it: for
salvation and every degree thereof is the work of God. We are his
workmanship, Ephesians. 2. 10.
even in respect of our spiritual life: Psalm. 100. 2.
He has made us and not we our selves: Esaias 26. 12.
He works all our works in us: 2 Cor. 3. 5.
we are not able to think a good thought, as of our selves: but as it
follows in the next words, Phil. 2. 13.
God works in us both to will and to do according to his good pleasure. And
we are to observe, that this exhortation is directed to the Phil. 1. 1, 6:
Saints at Philippi, in whom God had begun this good work. As therefore God
himself having begun this work, would as the Apostle says, finish it, Phil.
1. 6.
or bring it to perfection: so the Apostle exhorts them, who had entered into
the course of salvation, that they should go on in the same course cooperating
with God, and accomplishing their sanctification in the fear of God, as the
Apostle elsewhere 2 Cor. 7. 1.
speaks.

. VI. His fourth Testimony. 2 Cor. 7. 10. For the sorrow that His fourth
testimony, 2 Cor. 7. 10.
is according to God, works penance unto salvation that is stable. Here also
we see, says he, the respect of efficiency. For sorrow works penance,
penance works stable salvation. For sorrow does truly work in a man penance,
that is, detestation of sin, and a purpose to avoid sin. Therefore penance
also it self does truly work stable salvation, and is therefore necessary,
not one^ in regard of presence, but as a cause. Answ. It is true, that godly
sorrow, or the Spirit of God by it, works (...) repentance never to be
repented of, even repentance unto salvation. But it is not said, that either
godly sorrow or repentance does work salvation. But the Apostle says, that
godly sorrow works repentance, even such repentance as is a forerunner unto
salvation; or as the faithful speak, Act. 11. 18. That God had given the
Gentiles repentance unto life, and therefore such a repentance as was not to
be repented of. For the Apostle seems to have relation unto his own words,
verse 8. that he had repented, that he had made them sorry. But when he
understood that their sorrow had brought forth in them repentance, he did not
repent thereof. Repentance therefore which is unto salvation, is indeed a
necessary and undoubted forerunner of salvation, and salvation a certaice
consequent of repentance: necessary I say, because without it a sinner cannot
be saved, Luke 13. 3. Undoubted, because to whom God has given grace truly
to repent, it is an infallible token, that such an one shall be saved, Acts 11.
18. but a cause of salvation it is not, neither can be, unless he mean
Causa sine qua non.

. VII. His fifth Testimony. 2 Cor. 4. 17. For that our tribulation, His fifth
testimony, 2 Cor. 4. 17.
which presently is momentany and light works above measure exceedingly an
eternal weight of glory in us. What could be spoken more plainly? If
patience in tribulation does work a weight of eternal glory, who can deny,
but that there is some relation between patience and salvation? Unless
perhaps to work salvation be not to work something, or that upon the working,
there follows no relation. Answ. If the Apostle had said, that patience in
affliction does work an eternal weight of glory, he might from thence have
had some color, that patience has a relation of efficiency to salvation, and
yet but a color. But when the Apostle does not once mention patience, how
could he be so confident, as to ask, what could be spoken more plainly?
The Apostle speaks of affliction, both light and momentany, and says, that
it (...) works unto us an eternal weight of glory. Here then we are to
consider, in what sense affliction, which in it self is evil and miserable,
should work glory and happiness; being light, should work that which is most
ponderous; being momentany, should work that which is eternal, whether as a
cause, properly and in it own nature causing or working: or as an occasion,
which besides, or rather contrary to it own nature, which is evil, is to us
sanctified of God to be a means and occasion of our so great good. And to this
purpose let us consult with other places of holy Scripture: as Romans 5. 3, 4.
and Iam. 1. 12. In the former place, the Apostle says, we rejoice in
afflictions, knowing that affliction (...) works patience, and so Saint James
1. 3. Not that affliction in it self works patience, but rather the
contrary, as appears in men unregenerate, whom it makes to murmr, and
sometimes to blaspheme God, which the Devil by experience well knew, when he
moved God to ^fflict Job, Chap. 1. 11. and 2. 5. Do but touch all that he has
(says he) and again, touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse thee to
thy face. But afflictions are said to work patience in the faithful, because
the holy Ghost sanctifies their afflictions to them, and excercising them
thereby works in them patience: and what follows? Patience works (...)
probation, that is, as I have formerly expounded, it makes him that by
affliction is tried, (...). Not that patience makes him (...), but that by
patient bearing of affliction he is found and known to be (...), that is a
sound, approved, and upright Christian. For therefore God sends trials of all
sorts, that those who are 1 Cor. 11. 19.
(...) may be known. Now when men have been by patient bearing of
afflictions found to be (...), they are crowned with eternal life, as Saint
James says, Chap. 1. 12. Blessed is the man who patiently bears temptation,
that is, affliction: for when he shall be found to be (...), he shall
receive the Crown of life, which the Lord has promised to them that love him.
The meaning therefore of this place is, neither that affliction causes
patience, nor patience salvation: but that when the godly are afflicted, the
holy Ghost by affliction, where with they are exercised, works patience in
them, and patience works probation, because by patience, when they are tried,
they are known to be sound and approved, and probation works hope of
salvation. For when upon try all men are found to be approved, they shall
receive the Crown of life, which God has freely promised to give them. And it
is to be observed, that the word (...), which is translated to work, is given
not only to causes, but also to occasions. And therefore in such places (...)
does signify, it occasioneth, as when it it said, Romans 4. 15. the Law (...)
works anger.

. VIII. His sixth Testimony. Romans 8. 13. If by the Spirit ye mortify the
deeds of the flesh, you shall live: whence he would prove, That the
mortification of carnal conc^piscence is necessary to salvation, as a
condition and cause (and therefore has relation to salvation) from the
conditional particle If, and from the antithesis of the words going before, if
you live according to the flesh, you shall die. Answ. The conditional particle
used in conditional or connexive propositions always pretends a necessity
of consequence; insomuch that the connection, if it be not necessary, is not
absolutely true, but the necessity of efficiency it implies none. And as for
the necessity of consequence, that arises not only from causes, but from all
other arguments. And whereas from the Antithesis he would prove, that as to
live according to the flesh, causes death: so to mortify the deeds of the
flesh by the Spirit, causes life: I answer, that in both the parts the
connection or consequence is equally, that is, necessarily true: for if it were
not necessary, it were not absolutely true, but it is absolutely true because
of the authority of the Scriptures which are infallible; which is sufficient to
make good the Antithesis. But hence it follows not, that the condition of
either part should be taken from the same arguments; seeing it may be taken
from any other. This suffices for the Antithesis, that if by the Spirit ye
mortify the deeds of the flesh, it is an evident argument, that you shall
live: but if you live according to the flesh, it is an evident argument, that
you shall dye: therefore though the condition of the latter part be the cause
of the consequent: yet it is not so in the former, for sin is the meritorious
cause of damnation; but our obedience being a duty, and yet but unperfect,
cannot merit salvation. A servant not doing his duty, but the contrary, is
punished. A servant doing, or rather but endeavoring to do his duty, is
rewarded. In these two the arguments are not the same. A servant that does not
his duty deserves punishment, and his disobedience is the meritorious cause
of his punishment. But by doing his duty, especially if it be done
unperfectly (which is always our case) he does not deserve reward, and
therefore if he be rewarded, it is to be ascribed to his masters bounty, and
not to his desert. Such an Antithesis the Apostle makes between the reward of
sin, and of godliness, Romans 6. 23. Death is the due wages of sin, but
eternal life (which is the reward of godliness) is the free gift of God. And
further, as I said before, when I formerly answered this allegation: In this
and many other such conditional speeches, the antecedent is not the cause, but
a sign, token or presage of the consequent. If God have given you grace to
mortify the deeds of the flesh, it is an evident token, that you shall live.
If God has adorned you with his grace, it is to be presumed, that he will
crown his own grace with glory.

. IX. And such is his seventh testimony, p as before I have showed, His seventh
testimony, Romans 8. 17, 18. p Lib. 7. cap. 4.. 11.
Romans 8. 17, 18. The Spirit bears witness with our spirits that we are the
sons and heirs of God and coheires with Christ, if we suffer with him, that
we may also be glorified with him: where is no relation at all of efficiency,
betwixt our sufferings and glory. But Bellarmine will prove it, first, by the
conditional particle, (of which I spoke in answer to the last argument) which
does not, as he says, point out the cause, but the evidence by which the holy
Ghost does assure us, that we are the sons and heirs of God, and coheires
of Christ, who shall be glorified with him; namely, if we suffer with him.
Secondly, from the reason which is added concerning the excess of glory to our
sufferings which to my understanding does plainly confute it. For if the
sufferings of this life be not condign (as the Vulgar reads it) to the glory
that is to come; how should they merit it ex condigno, as they arrogantly
speak? But the scope of the Apostle in this place, is to encourage the
faithful to suffer for Christ; which he does by two arguments: the one from
the happy event, which is assurance of glorification, testified by the holy
Spirit; who testifies unto us, that if we have grace from God to suffer with
Christ, that we are the sons and heirs of God and coheires of Christ, who
shall be glorified with him. Not that ou^ sufferings do make us the sons
and heirs of God, etc. but that they are the signs and evidences by which the
holy Ghost does assure us, that we are so. The other from the disproportion
between our sufferings from him, and the glory which we shall have with him.
For the Apos^le having weighed both, resolves, for so he says, (...), that
all the sufferings of this life are not comparable to that glory, but of this
place more hereafter. Lib. 8. c. 2.. 18, etc.


. X. His eighth testimony: Romans 10. 10. with the heart we believe His eighth
testimony.
unto righteousness, and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation. We
see here, says he, that faith suffices not to salvation, because it is not
Romans 10. 0.
true and entire in the heart, unless thereto be added external confession.
And it seems that the Apostle alludeth to that speech of our Savior, Matthew.
12. 32, 33. Him that confesses me before men, will I confess before my
Father: and him that denies me before men, will I deny before my Father that
is in heaven.

Answ. All this we confess, that besides faith, confession, and many other
graces and duties are necessary to salvation, not as causes, but as causae sine
quibus non, as I have often said, which are no causes.

. XI. His ninth testimony: Matthew. 25. 34, 35. Come ye blessed His ninth
testimony, Mat. 25, 34, 35.
of my Father, possess the kingdom prepared for you before the beginning of
the world. For I was hungry and you gave me to eat, etc. Surely, says he,
the reason, which is rendered, does plainly show, that good works are aliquo
modo some way causes of salvation, and that for them the kingdom of heaven is
given. Answ. Of this place I have spoken before: Supr. Cap 4.. 12.
when I showed that the causes of salvation were noted, verse. 34. Come ye
blessed of my Father inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation
of the world. And the reason, which is rendered, is taken from good works, not
as the cause, for which salvation is given, but as the evidence according to
which our Savior judges.

. XII. His tenth testimony is out of the Epistle of Saint James, and His tenth
testimony, Iam. 1. 25. and 2. 14.
it is twofold, the former Iam. 1. 25. He that is not a forgetful hearer, but
a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed: the latter, Iam.
2. 14. what will it profit my brethren, if a man say that he has faith, and
have not works, will faith save him? But how, says he, out of the former, is
a man blessed in his deed, if his deeds have no relation to happin^sse, but
affo^diheir idle presence. Answ. We confess, that good works have relation to
happiness as they are necessary unto it, as the way, as the causa sine qua
non. Neither do I conceive how good works can be idle, where they are present,
though they do not merit that which infinitely exceeds their worth. And as
touching the other place Iam. 2. We confess also, that that faith which is in
profession only, and is void of good works, does not save a man, because it
is an idle and dead faith. This therefore proves good works to be necessary
necessitate praesentiae but for necessity efficioncie there is no show, nor
color.

. XIII. After those several testimonies he appealeth to the whole The Epistles
by him vouched.
Epistles of Peter, John, James, and Jude, whose chief intention was to prove,
that to justified men good works are necessary to salvation, and that faith
alone does not suffice as some in these times out of the Epistles of Paul, not
well understood, began to preach. I answer, that as the Apostles, whom he
names, urge the necessity of good works, so do all true preachers of the
Gospel at this day; yea Paul himself did urge it, Romans 6. Tit. 3. 8. 14. Heb.
1^ 14.
as much as any of them, if not more. But the necessity of efficiencie he may
as soon prove out of our sermons, as out of the writings of the Apostles.

. XIV. To the Scriptures he adds the testimonies of the Fathers, Testimonies
of Fathers. De justif. l. 4. c. 8.
who, as they censured for heretics those which denied works to be
necessary unto salvation: so themselves taught, that they be necessary. To
which both censure and doctrine of the Fathers, we do most willingly
subscribe. And we should greatly wonder, how this great Master of
Controversies, could be so idle, so impertinent, so frivolous a disputant; but
that, as I said before, these his discourses, proving the necessity of good
works, though they be impertinent to the maine Question, because they prove
not that which is in controversy betwixt us: yet are not impertinent to his
purpose, which was to calumniate us, and to bear the world in hand, that we
are such as deny the necessity of good works. But if the question were tried
by voices of the Fathers, innumerable testimonies might be produced out of
their writings; wherein they teach, that we are justified by faith and not by
works; yea in direct terms affirming, that which is the question between us,
that we are justified by faith See Lib. 6. c. 9.
alone. But that works are necessary, as causes, either to salvation, or
(which is the question) to justification; not any one pregnant testimony out of
the ancient Fathers, is, or as I suppose, can be produced. But to prove the
necessity of good works by way of presence, I shall not need to recite the
several testimonies, seeing I have my Lib. 7. cap. 1.
self delivered more to prove and to urge the necessity of good works, than
can be gathered out of all these testimonies put together.

. XV. In the third and last place, he brings a reason like to that His
reason. De justif. l 4 c. 9.
which he framed. l. 1. cap. 14. that faith alone does not justify. But does
he not dispute the same question here? did he not propound five De justif. l.
1. cap. 13.
principal arguments to prove, that faith does not justify alone; the fifth
and last whereof was from the necessity of good works; the handling whereof De
justif. l. 1. c. 18.
he put off to this place. Should he not then from the necessity of good
works prove, that faith does not justify alone. But in stead of proving that,
he endeavors to prove, that faith does not save alone. Thus craftily he
glydeth from one question to another for his own advantage: because he knew,
that more is required to salvation, than was required to justification. For
sanctification comes betwixt justification and salvation. And although we are
justified without works going before justification: yet we are not saved
without works going before salvation; they being the way, which God has
prepared for them that are justified to walk in toward their glorification. I
might therefore, according to the Laws of disputation, hold him to the
question, or refuse to give him answer. But he is so far from proving, that
faith does not justify alone, that he is not able to prove, that it does not
save alone, disputing in that sense, according to which we do hold, that faith
does justify alone. Now, for the understanding of our sense and meaning
certain distinctions heretofore propounded, must for avoiding of calumniations
be here repeated. First, that we do not mean that faith is the only grace
which does sanctify, as the Papists will needs misunderstand us: but that to
sanctification not only other graces do concur with faith, but good works
also. And consequently, that besides faith, the said graces and good works be
forerunners of our salvation. Secondly when we say, faith alone, we do not
mean that faith which is alone, being a solitary, an idle, a counterfeit and
dead faith severed from charity and other graces and destitute of goodworks;
but we mean a true and lively ^aith which purifieth the heart and works by
love, which cannot be severed from charity and other graces, as I have
heretofore proved. And therefore we hold, that although in respect of the act
of justifying or saving it alone: yet in respect of the being thereof, it never
is, nor (if it be a true justifying and savingfaith) can be alone. Thirdly,
when we do say, that faith alone justifies and saves, we speak with
relation to the object, or relatively, meaning, that the object, which faith
alone receives, does justify and save us, when we say therefore, that we are
justified or saved by faith alone, our meaning is, that we are justified only
by the righteousness of Christ which is apprehended by faith alone, and not by
our own righteousness: and that we are saved by the merits of Christ alone
received by faith, and not by our own works or merits: and consequently, that
Christ received by faith is the only meritorious cause of our salvation.

. XVI. Now let us hear Bellarmines dispute. Iffaith alone did Bellarmiues
reasons that faith does not, save alone.
save, and that works were not otherwise ^ecessary than in respect of presence
as the fruits and signs of faith: then it would follow, that faith could save,
though it wanted all manner of good works, and were joined with all manner of
vices and sins: but the consequent is false: therefore says he faith alone
does not save, and good works are necessary not only in regard of presence,
but also of some efficiencie. To the proposition I answer first, that it is
senseless, and implies a contradiction. For if good works must necessarily
be present with saving faith (which he confesses we do hold) how can it be
supposed without implying a contradiction, that it can save, being not only
destitute of all good works, but also accompanied with all manner of sin:
this is sufficient to overthrowe his whole dispute. Secondly, I deny the
consequence of his proposition. For justifieing and saving faith, though it
justify and save alone, yet it never is nor can be alone. Even as the eye in
respect of his being, cannot (if it be a true living eye) be alone, severed
from other parts of the body: yet in respect of the act of seeing, unto which
no other part does concur, it sees alone. Even so faith, which is the
spiritual eye of the soul, in respect of its being, cannot (if it be a true
lively faith) be alone, severed from the other graces, which are with it fellow
members of sanctification: but yet in respect of the Act of justifying and
saving, unto which no other graces concur with it as any causes thereof, it
justifyeth and saves alone; because it alone, and no other grace does receive
Christ unto justification and salvation. Thirdly, we do not say that the
presence of good works is necessary to salvation only as they are the fruits
and signs of faith: but also as necessary forerunners, as causa sine qua non,
as the way to salvation; and as the evidence, according to which the sentence
shall be pronounced. Which consideration disproveth the proof of his
consequence: which is, that according to our doctrine good works are required
to the act of saving only by accident, whose presence adds nothing to the
virtue of faith in justifying and saving, and so their absence detracteth
nothing from it, and therefore being taken away, faith never the less saves.

Answ. Things whose presence is necessary, cannot be said to be present by
accident. For such may be present or absent; but that which is necessary cannot
be otherwise, the thing being safe. But we hold the presence of works not to
be contingent, but necessary; both in respect of salvation, as the way to it,
and as Causa sine qua non; and of faith, as the unseparable fruits of it,
without which it is said to be dead. For what will it profit a man, says St.
James, Iam. 214.
if he shall say, that he has faith, and has not works, will that faith
save him? For as the body without the Spirit is dead, Iam. 2. 26.
so that faith, which is in profession only, and is without works is dead.

. XVII. But this reason of his he does illustrate by two unlike Bellarmine his
unlike likenesses.
similitudes. For, says he even as fire, because by its heat alone it
heateth, if from the fire were taken away all other qualityes, which are by
accident joined with heat, it would still without doubt heat. And as a father,
because by the only relation of paternity he has reference to his son, if
from him, who is a father, all other attributes were removed, as knowledgen,
^bility, power, health, beauty, and in stead os them there should succeed
ignorance, baseness, weakness, sickness, deformity; and among all these
attributes paternity should remain: yet still that father should have relation
to his son: Even so because a Christian apprehends salvation by faith
alone, and unto it is referred by our adversaryes; surely it follows, that
faith remaining, he may be saved, although he have no good works, and have
many ill.

Answ. In the former similitude he compares a Christian man to fire, faith to
heat, and other graces and good works to such other qualityes as in fire by
accident concur with heat. In which similitude nothing is like. For neither
does a Christian man justify or save others by faith, as fire by his heat does
heat other things, neither is he justified or saved by his faith, as it is a
quality inherent, but as it is the hand to receive Christ^ neither are other
graces or duetyes of sanctification which we call good works, to be compared
with, I know not what, accidental qualityes concurring with heat; but to those
unseparable qualityes of fire, viz, light and drynes. For even in the fire that
is inflamed, there do concur necessarily with heat dryness and light,
neither were it a true fire without them: and yet the act of heating is to be
ascribed to the heat of the fire properly, and not to the light or dryness of
the element: so in a true Christian that is justified, there does concur
necessarily with faith, both other sanctifying graces answerable to the
dryness of the fire, and also the light of a Christian conversation, without
which he is not to be held a true Christian, or truly justified; and yet the
act of justifying or saving is not to be ascribed, either to other graces, or
to good works, but only to faith receiving Christ, or rather to Christ only
received by faith. In the other similitude he compares the reference which
faith has to salvation, unto that relation with is between father and son.
But faith and salvation are no such relatives. Neither are the graces of the
sanctification or good works to be compared to those accidental adjuncts
attributed to a father, which may come and go, as being not necessary to the
being of a father; but rather to those properties of the humane nature, as
reason, will, understanding, wit etc. For although a man cannot become a father
without these: yet his being a father is not not to be ascribed to these.

. XVIII. And whereas he would seem to take away the answer of his
adversaties, (who allege, that his supposition is impossible,) both because in
his first book he had proved, that says may truly and indeed be severed from
charity and good works: and also because at least in conceit, it may be
severed from them; which he says is sufficient for the confirmation of an
hypotheticall pr^position: neither can his adversaries deny it, who teach thah
faith and works have that relation, which is between the cause and the
effect: Hereunto I reply First, that I have formerly not only answered his
arguments which he produced to this purpose; Lib. 6. Cap. 2. and 3.
but also proved by unanswereable arguments that true justifying faith cannot
be severed from charity and good works. Secondly, as I said even now, his
supposition implies a contradiction, and therefore is impossible. Impossible,
I say, that works being supposed to be present necessitate presentiae, should
in the same speech be truly supposed to be absent. Thirdly, If Bellarmine can
conceive, that true justifying and saving faith may be without charity and good
works, then he may also conceive, that that faith may save which is severed
from charity, and destitute of good works.

His assumption I grant: for we teach, according to the Scriptures, that that
faith, which is alone severed from charity and good works, does justify or
save, neither alone nor at all, and do ascribe less to such a faith, than the
Papists themselves do. But his conclusion is faulty, as containing more than
can be inferred upon the premises: that good works are necessary not only in
regard of presence, but also of some Efficiencie, which was not so much as
mentioned in the antecedent of the proposition, which the conclusion should
gainsay, and say no more. Thus much of the necessity of good works.

CHAP. VI. Of the verity of the justice of works, and of the possibility of
fulfilling the Law.
. I.

NOw Bellarmine will discourse of the truth of the justice of works, or of
actual righteousness. De justif. lib. 4. cap. 10.
And in this dispute he spends eigth Chapters. Of the truth of the justice of
good works, not denied by us.
But to what end? for, I fear, he wandreth still. He had in the first book
propounded five principal arguments to prove that faith does not justify
alone. The Fifth and last was, that good works also do justify, and
therefore not faith alone. This assertion he labors to prove by diverse
arguments. The first from the necessity of good works, which I have answered.
The second from the verity of the justice of works, namely that the good
works of the faithful and regenerate are truly good, which we do not deny,
we say indeed, that the seeming good works of men unregenerate are not truly
good: because an evil tree cannot bring forth good fruit. But the good works
of the regenerate, being the works of grace, and the fruits of the Spirit, we
acknowledge to be truly good. But will it hereupon follow, that therefore they
are, or may be justified by works? Nothing less. He must prove that the
works of the regenerate are not only truly good, but also purely and
perfectly good, and not only that, but that they are also perpetually and
universally good. For if they fail in any one particular (as in Iam. 3. 2.
many things we, says James the just, offend all) they cannot be justified by
their obedience. For he that offende^h in one is guilty Iam. 2. 10.
of the breach of the whole Law: and is so far from being justified by his
obedience, that by the sentence of the Law he is accursed: because he has not
continued in all the things which are written in the book of the Law to do
them. unless therefore he can prove, that not only some, but all the works of
the faithful are not only truly, but also purely and perfectly good (which
is impossible to be proved) he cannot possibly conclude, that they are
justified by them: will you then know, to what end serves this discourse? The
subtle Sophister, because he would seem to have the better end of the
staff, chooses rather to confute our pretended errors, than to defend his
own.

. II. But indeed this whole dispute is defensive: serving to answer
Bellarmines dispute is indeed defensive.
a piece of one of our arguments against justification by inherent
righteousness: because our obedience is neither total, nor perfect, nor
perpetual. Not total, because we neither do nor can fulfill the whole Law
of God. Not perfect, nor pure, because it is stained with the flesh. Not
perpetual, because interrupted, either by omission of duetyes or commission of
sins. To the two former Bellarmine answers, (the third being unanswerable)
and maintayneth the contrary assertions; setting down the state of the
question thus: Whether men justified may by the help of Gods grace so fulfill
the Law of God, that their works are not only not to be called sins, but
also deserve truly and properly to be called just. But this question comes
short of that which he ought to prove, in two respects. For first if the just,
meaning all the just, are justified by their works, he must prove that not
only some choice men may by the special help of Gods grace fulfill the Law,
but that all do; or else he must confess that they are not justified by
their obedience. Neither is it sufficient, that their works be not sins or
truly just, unless their works, not some, but all, be not only truly, but
also purely good. But of this question so propounded by him, he says that we
(whom he calls heretics) hold the negative; The Papists (who are no
heretics) hold the affirmative; whose assertion he sets down in three
articles.

First, that the Law of God to just men is absolutely possible, not indeed by
the only strength of nature, but by the help of divine grace. Secondly, That
the works of the righteous are simply, and absolutely just, and after their
manner prefect. Thirdly, That a man is truly justified by works. Thus you see
how, as it were by chance, he stumbleth upon the maine question (where unto
his whole dispute ought to be referred) bringing it in as a proof of the
verity of the justice of good works; where by it selfought to be either proved
or defended, otherwise all this discourse of the verity of good works is
impertinent. These three he says he will prove in order. And in all three I
must have the patience to follow him.
. III. And first of the possibility or impossibility of fulfilling the Law.
Concerning which, what we do hold, may appear by these distinctions, for
first, we do not hold, that it is absolutely impossible: Whether the
faithful do or can fulfill the Law.
for God, if it so please him, can enable man perfectly to fulfill the Law, as
he did in our first creation, and as he will do at our full redemption. But
in this estate, since the fall, to a man living in the flesh, it is not
possible. And thus De peccator. meritis and remiss. l. 2. c. 6. and 7.
Augustine, if the question be whether God be able to make a man to live
without sin, does freely confess it, but if the question be, whether God
ever enabled any man to be without sin, that he denies. The second
distinction is concerning the regenerate and the unregenerate. For unto the
unregenerate being fallen in Adam, the Law through their own fault is
impossible. But the regenerate may be said to keep the whole Law, and that in
three respects. First, in regard of their faith: for he ithat truly believes
in Christ has fulfilled the Law: Romans 10. 4.
for Christ is (...) the end and complement of the Law to every one that
believes, his obedience being imputed to them. Qui credit in Christum, says
in Romans 10.
Theodoret, scopum Legis adimplet: he that believes in Christ fulfilleth the
scope of the Law, and Apud Oecum. in Romans 10.
Photius, (...), the Apostle therefore says, that he which believes in
Christ fulfilleth the law. Ambrose likewise on those in Romans 2. 13.
words, not the hearers of the law, but the doers shall be justified: Hoc
dicit, says he, quia non hi justi sunt, qui audiunt legem, sed qui credunt in
Christum, quem tex promisit, and hoc est facere legem. This he says, because
not they are j^st who hear the Law, but they who believe in Christ, whom the
law promised: and this is to perform the law: and again, Qui credit in
Christum hic fecisse legem dicitur: whosoever believes in Christ he is said
to have performed the law. The like has Sedulius, that faith stands for the
perfection of the whole law, in Romans 10. 4. Secondly, in respect of our new
obedience. Thirdly, in respect of Gods acceptance, accepting of our sincere,
though weak endeavor, and pardoning our defectivenesse therein; which being
forgiven, our obedience is reputed, as if we had performed all. For as
Augustine says, Retract. Lib. i. cap. 13.
Omnia ergo mandata facta deputantur, quando quicquid non fit, ignoscitur. All
the Commandments are esteemed as done, when that which is not done, is
pardoned. But the question is properly understood of our new obedience, in
regard whereof another distinction is to be acknowledged, between the keeping
or observing of the law, and the fulfilling of it; which the Papists feeme to
confound. For all the faithful by their new obedience keep the law according
to the measure Ephesians. 4. 7.
of grace received; but none fulfill it. Their new obedience consisting In
studio pretatis and justitia, in the study of piety and righteousness, whereby
they are studious of good works. This study stands in a syneere desire, an
unfeigned purpose, an upright endeavor to walk in the obedience of all Gods
Commandments. And this study and practice of piety, though accompanied with
manifold (...), yea, with many slippes both of omission and commission,
happening contrary to their general desire and purpose through humane
infirmity; the Lord (who in his children accepts of the will k for the deed)
esteems so highly of, that those things which are done with an upright heart
and sincere endeavor, are said 2 Cor. 8. 12.
in the Scriptures to be done with the whole soul, and with a perfect heart,
which must be evangelically, and not legally understood: this perfection
standing not in the perfect performance, but in the uprightness of the heart,
striving toward perfection. Thus all the faithful keep the law, who have a
sincere desire, purpose and endeavor to obey it; but none do or can fulfill
it, unless they continue in all the things which are written in the Book of
the law to do them. Which never any since the fall (Christ only excepted)
were able to do: for the law is kept with the heart, Psalm. 119. 34. 69. 129.
but not fulfilled but by the Qui legem implet, observat totus, totam, per totam
vitam. That the Law is possible Bell larmine proves by (...). Matthew. 11. 30.
whole man, I say, the whole man, performing the whole law, always.

. IV. But that the law is possible to the faithful, Bellarmine endeavors to
prove, by Scriptures, Fathers, and Reason. Out of the Scriptures he produces
three sorts of testimonies: the first of these, Which testify that the law is
not only possible, but also easy: as first, Mat. 11. 30. For my yoke is
easy, and my burden light. Secondly, 1 Ioh. 5. 3. And his Commandments are
not grievous. To the former I answer; that by the yoke and burden of Christ
we are not to understand the yoke of the law exacting perfect obedience to be
performed by us unto justification, or for default thereof subjecting us to the
curse; for this was the chief yoke of bondage which neither we nor our fathers
were able to bear, Act. 15. 10. From which our Savior has Gal. 5. 1.
made us free: but by the yoke and burden of Christ we are to understand his
Law and Doctrine evangelicall, which may be reduced to two Heads, the Law and
Doctrine of faith, the Law and Doctrine of obedience, and that twofold, the
obedience of his precepts, which is called our new obedience, and Obedientia
crucis, which is the taking up and bearing our cross. The law of faith
resp^cteth our justification; the Doctrine of our new obedience, respects our
sanctification; the obedience of the Cross is Christian patience or Tolerantia
crucis. And these yokes or burdens Christ is it seems, would have men coming
unto him to take upon them, by learning of him (which argues, that by them
Christ's Doctrine or Discipline is meant) that they might be eased from those
yokes under which they labor, and those burdens under which they are wearied.
And these are of two sorts, the guilt of sin which is a most heavy yoke or
burden under which the guilty conscience labors: and the corruption of sin
wherewith men being overladen are wearyed. From the former men are freed in
their justification by the law of faith, which is easy and light, Christ
having taken our burden upon him. For even as the Israelites in the
wilderness, when they were bitten by the fiery serpents, had no greater burden
or task laid upon them than to lift up their eyes toward the Brazen Serpent,
and were cured: Ioh. 3. 4, 5.
Even so we, when we are stung by the old Serpent and labor under the guilt
of sin, and desire to be eased or cured thereof: this charge our Savior
lays upon us, to lift up the eye Ioh. 6. 40.
of faith to him that was figured by the brazen Serpent, and we shall find
rest unto our souls. From the second men are freed in their sanctification by
Christ's Law or doctrine of obedience both active and passive. The active is our
new obedience, whereof as of sanctification there are two parts: mortification,
whereby we dye to sin, and our vivification whereby we live to God, both which
the Doctrine of Christ does teach. Tit. 2. 11, 12. The grace of God which
brings salvation has appeared to all, teaching us, that we should renounce
all ungodliness and wordly lusts (there is mortification) and that we should
live soberly, and justly, and holily in this present world, there is our
vivification. So Ephesians. 4. 20, 21, 24. Those that have learned Christ have been
taught to be put off the old man and to put on the new.

. V. This yoke also is easy to the faithful, and this burden light. Christ's
yoke easy in respect of our new obedience.
First, because the faithful being freed from the terror and coaction of the
Law are enabled to obey God with willing minds, as not being under the Law, but
under grace. Secondly, because as the Lord promised in the Covenant of grace,
which is the doctrine of the Gospel, to give grace to the heirs of promise,
whereby they are enabled to serve him, with upright hearts and with willing and
constant minds: so does he assist them with his grace making them both able and
willing to worship him in holiness and righteousness.

Thirdly, because the new obedience required of us does not consist in the
perfect performance, which the Lord does not expect from such weakness as is
in the best of us, but in the sincere and upright desire, purpose, and
endeavor to walk in obedience, according to the measure of grace received.

Fourthly, because our unperfect obedience is accepted of God in Christ, and
the wants thereof pardoned by the intercession of Christ, who with the odours
Apoc. 8. 4.
of his own sacrifice perfumeth the incense of our prayers and of other duties
making them acceptable unto God. And this was figured by that ceremony of the
golden Exodus 28. ^6, 38.
plate as I have showed heretofore, which the high priest, who was a type of
Christ, was to wear in the foresront of the Miter with this inscription,
Holiness of the Lord, that is, of the Messiah, who is JEHOVAH our
righteousness, to the end that Christ figured by the high priest might bear
the iniquity of the holy things, which the children of Israel should hallow in
all their holy gifts, and it was always to be upon his forehead, that they
may be accepted before the Lord.

Fifthly, because if through humane frailty, the flesh prevailing against the
Spirit, the faithful do at any time offend, as in many things we all do: we
have an Advocate with the Father, Christ Jesus the righteous and he is the
propitiation for our sins, 1 Ioh. 2. 2. He sitting at the right hand of his
Father makes intercession for us, Romans 8. 34. Heb. 9. 24.

. VI. Against the fourth reason Bellarmine takes exception. For Bellarmines
dilemma.
whereas some of our Divines have taught, as he says, that therefore it is
called an easy yoke and light burden because of the remission of such
offenses as the faithful commit, he pusheth at them with this Dilemma. That
this remission or not imputation, either takes away the obligation of the Law,
so that the faithful though they do offend do in^urre no guilt: or else does
not take away this obligation, but that the faithful contract the guilt which
afterward is remitted. If the former, then, says he, it ceasseth to be a Law.
For it is no Law which does not bind. If the latter, then it is a hard y^ake
and a heavy burden which cannot be borne. To the former I answer, that
remission is of guilt contracted, and therefore it is absurdly surmised, that
there should be remission where was no guilt. To the latter: that according to
the Law of faith the guilt contracted is remitted to the faithful returning
unto God, confessing their sin, and craving pardon in the name and mediation
of Christ. Which proves the Law of works to be an hard yoke and heavy
burden: but the Law of faith to be easy and light. For by the Law of works
the guilt is contracted, and by the Law of faith it is remitted.

. VII. But the obedience of the Cross also serves to free us The obedience of
the cross, is also the yoke of Christ.
from the Corruption of sin. For he that has suffered in the flesh ceasseth
from sin. And therefore David pronounced the man blessed whom the Lord
chasteneth Psalm. 94 12.
and teaches out of his Law. For (...) quae nocent doc^nt. We learn
obedience Heb. 5. 8.
by that which we suffer. David therefore professes Psalm. 119. 71.
that it was good for him that he had been afflicted, that he might learn
the statutes of the Lord and confesses that before he was afflicted Verse. 67.
he went astray: but now, says he, I have kept thy word. This also is a
yoke; which Jeremy says it is good for a man to bear, even in, or from his
youth Lam. 3. 27. For to the Godly it is made an easy yoke, and light burden.
First, In comparison of that superexcellent 2 Cor. 4. 17.
eternal weight of glory wherewith the Lord does recompense our momentany and
light afflictions, which are Romans 8. 18.
no way comparable to the glory which shall be revealed.

Secondly, because affliction works patience, and patience probation, and
probation hope, and hope of eternal glory makethus to swallow all the
difficulties of this life, and with patience and comfort to bear afflictions,
yea to rejoice and to triumph in them, Romans 5. 3. and 8. 37. Looking unto JESUS
Heb. 12. 2:
the author and finisher of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him
endured the cross, despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of
the throne of God. Wherefore Saint Iam. 1. 2, 12.
James and Saint 1 Pet. 1. 8. 4. 13.
Peter in their Epistles, do teach it to be a matter of joy to the faithful
when they are afflicted.

Thirdly, because the nature of afflictions to the faithful is changed, being
not evil, not punishments to them, but rather blessings, as being either
fatherly chastisements, or trials for their good: which proceeding from Gods
love are so moderated by his mercy that they do not exceed their strength, 1
Cor. 10. 13. and are through Gods providence made to work for their good, Romans
8. 28. and profit, that they may be partakers of his holiness, Heb. 12. 10.
Affliction therefore to the faithful is (...), a commodious or easy yoke.

Fourthly, because Christ by his Spirit does minister such comfort Psalm. 94. 19^
to the faithful in their afflictions, that as their sufferings increase, so
their consolation abounds by Christ, 2 Cor. 1. 4, 5.

. VIII. So much of his first Testimony. In the second place, His second place.
1 Ioh. 5. 3.
1 Ioh. 5. 3. The Holy Ghost sets down two notes, whereby we may know that
we love God. For this, says he, is the Love of God: first, that we keep his
commandments: for this in other places also is made the proper note of his
Love, viz. to keep his Commandments, Exodus 20. 6. John 14. 15. the second,
that his Commandments are not grievous, for Genesis 29. 20.
nihil difficile amanti. Nothing is difficult to him that loves. And so Lib.
de perfectione justitiae.
Augustine answers the Pelagian urging this place, quis nesciat -- non esse
grave quod diligendo fit, non timendo. So that if we truly love God, we will
out of love, and not out of servile fear and constraint, yield willing
obedience to the Commandments of God. So that this is the meaning, to him that
loves God, the Commandments of God are not grievous, but he delights in
them according to the inner Man, yielding voluntary and cheerful obedience
thereto, not in perfection, but according to the measure of grace received. For
when the Love of God is shed Romans 5. 5.
abroad in our hearts by the Spirit of God assuring us in some measure of Gods
love toward us, then are our hearts enlarged to love God again: and being
enlarged Psalm. 119. 3^:
we do not only walk, but run also in the way of Gods commandments, that
is, willingly and cheerfully according to the measure of our faith and love,
we obey them. But though the faithful do willingly obey Gods commandments
so according to their ability, yet they cannot perfectly fulfill them.

. IX. His second sort of testimonies is of such as teach that the His second
rank of testimonies.
Law is kept by them that Love.

Of this sort he cites three testimonies, the first, concerning the Love of
God, Ioh. 14. 23. If a man love me, he will keep my word. The other 2.
concerning the love of our neighbor, Romans 13. 8. he that loves his neighbor
has fulfilled the Law, Gal. 5. 14. all the Law is fulfilled in one word, thou
shall love thy neighbor as thy self. From hence he argues thus: They that
are able to love God and their neighbor, are also able to fulfill the Law: the
faithful are able to love God and their neighbor, therefore they are able to
fulfill the Law. The proposition he proves by these three testimonies of
Scripture. The assumption, thus. If we cannot love God and our neighbor then
can we not be the disciples or friends of Christ, but it is absurd to say,
that none can be the disciples or friends of Christ: therefore we are able to
love God and our neighbor. The proposition of this prosyllogisme he proves
out of, Ioh. 15. 35. Hereby shall all men know that you are my disciples, if
you have love one to another, and John. 15. 14. you shall be my friends if you
do the things that I command you. Now the thing which he did command was, that
they should love one another. To this long discourse a short answer may
suffice: we do confess, that all they who love God and their neighbor do
keep Gods commandments according to the measure of their love: but we deny,
that any can fulfill the Law of God, who have not a full and perfect love, and
that to the perfection of love, such as the Law requires, none can attain in
this life. For our knowledge is but in part, therefore our love: our
regeneration is but in part (we being but partly spiritual and partly
carnal,) and therefore our love. The Law is impossible, by reason of the
flesh, therefore whiles the flesh remains in us, the Law is not possible unto
us.

. X. Bellarmine confesses that our charity in this life is unperfect because
Bellarmines reply.
it may be increased, and because it shall be greater in our country.
Notwithstanding he holds, that it is so perfect as may suffice for the
fulfilling of the Law. But David says, that the Law of God is Psalm. 19. 7.
perfect, and so perfect as nothing may be added thereto, and therefore
requires perfect righteousness not only in respect of the parts but also of
the degrees unto which nothing can be added. For if any thing can be added to
it, then something is wanting, which is required to perfection: and what is
wanting is a fault. Peccatum est, says De perfect. justif. ad 15.
Augustine, cum vel non est charitas qu^ esse debet, vel minor est quam debet.
It is a sin, either when there is not Charity which ought to be, or when it is
less than it ought to be. And no doubt but it is less than it ought to be,
when it is not so great as the Law requires, and it is not so great as the Law
requires, whiles it may be increased. For as Epist. 29.
Augustine says, quamdi^ augeri potest (charitas) profecto illud quod minus
est quam debet ex vitio est. Whiles Charity may be increased, assuredly that
which is less than it ought to be, is faulty, or vicious. By reason of which
vice: there is not a righteous man upon earth, that does good and sins not.
By reason of which vice no man living shall be justified before God. By reason
of which vice if we shall say that we have no sin, we deceive our selves, and
the truth is not in us. And for which though we be never so good proficients we
must of necessity say, forgive us our debts, etc. His second reply.


. XI. Secondly, he replyeth: that the Law which prescribes love, requires no
more but that we should love with our whole heart. But that this not only may
be done, but also should be done in the new Testament, the Scripture does
witness, Deu^. 30. 6. Answ. The Phrase of loving with the whole heart being
legally understood according to the perfection prescribed in the Law, does
signify as it sounds, neither can be performed by any mortal man, though
regenerate, because he is partly flesh and partly Spirit. Neither can more,
than the Law requires in this behalf, be performed in our Country. For as De
spiritu and litera, cap. 36.
August. says, in the life to come, our love shall be not only above that which
here we have, but also far above that which we either ask or think.
Notwithstanding it can be no more than (what the Law requires) with all our
heart, with all our soul and with all our mind. For there does not remain in
us any thing which may be added ad totum to that which is all; for if any thing
remain which might be added, then it is not totum all. But the phrase is many
times Evangelically understood, as in the place quoted, to signify not
absolute or legal perfection, but the integrity and uprightness of the heart,
which is the Evangelicall perfection, as I have showed elsewhere Covenant of
grace, c^ap. 10. His third reply.
, and shall again ere long declare.

. XII. Thirdly, he replyeth, that the Scriptures teach, that men may be
perfect in this life. And to this purpose alle^geth, Genesis 6. 9. and 17. 1.
Matthew. 5. 48. and 19. 17. Phil. 3. 15. 1 John 2. 5. The use of the word in
these and some other places is to be distinguished. For in the most of them it
is not opposed to imperfection (and so many places are impertinently alleged)
but either to hypocrisy, and so it signifies up. right and sincere, as Genesis
6. 9. and 17. 1. Or to partiality when we are good to some but not to others,
as Matthew. 5. 48. Be you perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect, doing good
to men of all sorts, both good and bad, both friends and foes: or to infancy
and childhood, and so it signifies adultus a grown man, and so it is used, 1
Cor. 14. 20. Heb. 5. 14. and so in the place cited, Phil. 3. 15. Where the
Apostle acknowledging that he had not attained to perfection but still
laboring to be a good proficient, exhorts so many as are perfect to be of
the same mind with him, that is to strive toward perfection, as having not
yet attained to i^. In 1 John 2. 5. the phrase is varied. In him that keeps
Gods word the love of God is perfected, that is perfectly known, hereby we
know that we are in him. And so is the word used, Iam. 2. 22. 2 Cor. 12. 9.
There remains only the answer of Christ to the justitiary, Matthew. 19. 17.
If thou will be perfect etc. Which as I have showed before our Savior fitteth
to the disposition of that justitiary whom having a great conceit of himself,
that he had kept all the commandments of God from his youth, he thought good
to discover and unmaske by a commandment of trial. If thou will, Verse. 21.
says he, be perfect, that is, If thou will approve thy self to be a
perfect observer of the Law, as thou pretendest, go and sell that thou have,
and give to the poor, and thou shall have treasure in heaven, and come and
follow me. For if thou refusest so to do, thou shall bewray thy self to be
a mere wordling, preferring the love of the world besore the love of God, and
desiring to retain thy earthly wealth, rather than to obtain the heavenly
treasure.

. XIII. His third sort of testimonies is of such as do testify, that some
have kept the Commandments of God, and namely those of loving with the whole
heart; and of not coveting. And to to this purpose he alleges the examples of
David, of Josiah, of Asa and his people, of Iosuah, and others whom he does
but name, of Zachary and Elizabeth, of the Apostles, and namely of Paul, and in
conclusion of Ezechias and of Abraham. Answ. All these were sincere and upright
keepers and observers of the Law: but none of them were perfect and perpetual
fulfillers of it; none of them were without sin.

David was a man according to Gods own heart, in respect of his uprightness
and integrity, 1 King. 3. 6. and for that, and not for any absolute perfection
he is commended in the places alleged, Psalm. 119. 10. 1 King. 14. 8. Act. 13.
22. 1 King. 15. 5. And yet for all this David was a sinner, and in many of his
Psalms Psalm. 25. 7. 11. 38. 4, 18.
bewayleth his manifold sins, Psalm. 51. 5, 119. 17^.
desiring the Lord not to enter Psalm. 143. 2. and 130. 3, 4.
into judgment with him, for if he should, neither he nor any other could be
just in his sight; placing his justification in the remission Psalm. 32. 1. Romans
4. 6.
of his sins, and in Gods acceptance of him imputing unto him righteousness
without works.

2 King. 23. 25.
Josias, also was a godly and upright king, but yet not without fault; in that
he harkened not unto the Words of Necho from the mouth of God, but
presumptuously fought against him, 2 Chronicles. 35. 22.

Of the people under Asa, no more can be gathered, 2 Chro. 15. 15.
but that with upright hearts and willing minds they entered into a covenant to
seek the Lord in sincerity and truth. Of Asa himself, the Scripture indeed
does testify, 2 Chro. 15. 17.
that his heart was perfect, that is, upright, before the Lord all his days.
Notwithstanding in the same place it is said, that the high places were not
taken away: and in the next Chapter three sins of his are recorded: 2 Chro.
16. 7, 10, 12.
that he had relied on the King of Syria and not on the Lord: that being
reproved therefore by the Prophet Hanani, he committed the Prophet to prison:
that in his sickness he sought not to the Lord but to the Physicians.

That which is said of Josh. 11. 14, 15.
(...) does not concern the observation of the Moral Law, but those politic
precepts, which the Lord had given to Moses, and Moses to Iosu^h, concerning
the utter destruction of the Deuteronomy. 7. 2.
Canaanites, whom the Lord had delivered into his hands.

Of Luke 1, 6.
Zachary and Elizabeth it is said, first, that they were just before God, that
is, upright: and secondly, that they walked in all the commandments and
ordinances of the Lord blameless, which latter they might do, and yet be
far from that perfection which the Law requires. For Paul professes of
himself, that even before his conversion he was, touching the righteousness,
which is in the Law blameless, Phil. 3. 6. They were blameless before men,
but not faultles before God. For Zacharias did use to sacrifice for his own
sins, as well as for others, as Augustine says in his answer to this
argument alleged by the Pelagians. And who knows not, that for the sin of
incredulity he was both deaf Luke 1. ^0. 62.
and dumb for a time.

As touching the Apostles before the resurrection of Christ; though our Savior
call them his friends, and gives them this testimony that z Luke 12. 4.
they had kept his word: yet who can be ignorant how far they were Ioh. 15.
15.
Joh. 17. 6.
at that time from perfection, and with how great imperfections they kept his
word.

But it is strange, that he should allege the example of S. Paul. Romans 7. as
one that had kept the Commandment forbidding concupiscence: when in that
chapter he does not only confess, that by that Commandment Romans 7. 7, 8.
he was convicted to be a sinner, in that he had concupiscence: but also
that that habitual concupiscence might appear exceedingly sinful, it did
take occasion by the Law to work in him all manner of actual concupiscence.

. XIV. But Bellarmines conceit is, that concupiscence in the Apostle Whether
concupiscence in the Apostle were a sin.
was no sin, because he did not consent to it. Whereto I answer, first, that
as he was carnal Romans 7. ^4. 25.
he did consent unto it, but not as he was spiritual, for so he says: I
delight in the Law of God after the inward man; Romans 7. 23.
but I see another Law in my members warring against the Law of my mind, and
bringing me into captivity to the Law of sin which is in my members. Whereupon
he cries out, v. 24. O wretched man that I am, who shall deliver me from the
body of this death? meaning thereby the flesh, or the body of sin. Secondly,
though the Apostle had not consented to concupiscence, yet both the habitual
concupiscence it self remainning in him after his regeneration, and the actual
concupiscences going before consent* arising from thence, were sins. The
habitual is often called by the Apostle a sin, and is noted to be the sinning
sin, which taking occasion by the Law to send forth evil concupiscences
(namely which the Law forbids) was exceedingly sinful. As for those (...)
or first motions of sin in the thought or affections going before consent,
and arising from our own concupiscence: they are those very sins which are
directly forbidden in the tenth Commandment, for those which are joined Mat.
5. 28.
with consent, are forbidden in the former Commandments. Neither could Paul,
who had been trained up in the Law, be ignorant of that which the very
heathen knew by the light of nature, that evil concupiscence, accompanied with
consent, was a sin. But that which is forbidden in the tenth commandment,
the Apostle had not known to be a sin, except the Law had said, thou shall
not lust, or thou shall not have any evil concupiscence.

Hence Bellarmine concludes, that because the Law has been kept by many, it
is possible. Neither do we deny it to be kept by the faithful, in respect of
their upright walking in all the Commandments of God, but we deny it to be
perfectly fulfilled by them. Their new obedience which they perform with
upright hearts and willing minds, has the title of perfection given unto it,
and is a perfection begun in respect of the parts (for even an infant that is
formed in the womb is perfect in respect of his parts) and is accepted of God
in Christ, the Lord not imputing to the faithful their imperfections. And it
is a good saying of Augustine Retract. l. 1. cap. 19.
O^nia ergo mandata facta deputantur, quando quicquid non fit ignoscitur. All
the Commandments are esteemed as done, when that which is not done is pardoned.

XV. But this answer, concerning perfection of obedience begun, Bellarmines
instance that the godly before mentioned, absolutely fulfilled the Law and were
perfect.
and the imperfections remitted, will not serve the turn, says B^llarmine.
For he cannot absolutely be said to fulfill the Law, that sins in ke^ping
it. But the Scripture says of the Fathers, that not only, they did absolutely
keep the Law, but also that they kept it with their whole heart, and with a
perfect heart. Yea ^zechias profess^th that he had walked before the Lord in
truth and with a perfect heart. And if Ezechias walked before God with a
perf^ct heart, who will deny it to Abraham, to whom it was said, Genesis 17. 1.
walk before me and be perfect. Answ. We do read, that the faithful did
keep the Law, but we never read, that they did ab^olutely fulfill it, but
that all of them had their imperfections, and their sins. And although many
o^ them abounded with good works, yet their justification consisted in the
remission of their sins, and Gods acceptance of them in Christ, imputing
righteousness unto them without works.

And where as it is said, that they obeyed God with their whole heart What is
meant by a perfect heart.
and with a perfect heart, this is to be understood of an entire or upright
heart. The hebrew words Tham, Thom, T^min, and Shalem, which signif^e perfect
or perfection, are synonyma or words of the same sense with ^ashar, Iosher, and
Emeth, that is, upright, uprightness and truth, or sincerity, and are
signified by the phrase of walking with God, or be fore God, and a^e the same
with the Greek words (...), all of them opposed, not to imperfection, but to
hypocrisy. For Thom, Tham, and Thamin consider these places Psalm. 35. 21.
where Thom and Iosher are used as synonima, the latter being the exposition of
the former. Let perfection and (...) preserve me. Josh. 24. 14. Where Thamin
and Em^th are used promiscuously, serve the Lord in perfection and in truth.
Psalm. 37. 37. where Tham and Iashar are put for the same; observe the perfect
man, and behold the upright, for the end of that man is peace. So Job is
commended to have been Ish The Vejashar a perfect and upright man. The word
Shalem, which in the same speech of Ezechias, 2 King. 20. 3. is by the 72.
translated (...), perfect is by them re^dred Esaias 38. 3. (...) a true heart: as
an upright heart is called Heb. 10. 22.

. XVI. The phrase of performing duties with the whole heart What is meant by
whole heart.
Deuteronomy. 26. 16 as to seek God with all the heart, Deuteronomy. 4. 29. Psalm. 119. ^,
10. to keep his Commandments with all the heart and with all ^he soul, 2
King. 23. 3. Psalm. 119. 34, 69. to turn unto the Lord with all the heart,
Io^l. 2. 12. imports nothing else (where it is not legally understood) but an
entyre or upright heart, that is, not an heart and an heart, (as hypocrites use
to speak, Psalm. 12. 2.) 1 Chronicles. 12. 33. the phrase not with an heart and an
heart, is expounded verse. 38. to be a perfect or upright heart. Thus to serve
the Lord in truth, is to serve him with the whole heart, 1 Samuel 12. 24. and to
praise God with the whole heart, Psalm. 9. 1. and 111. 1. is to prai^e him with
uprightness of heart, Psalm. 119. 7.

Thus to walk with God, or before God, is to be perfect or upright Genesis 17.
1. and to be perfect or upright is to walk with God, or before him, for to
walk with God is for a man to behave himself as in his p^esence* and to walk
before God is to behave a man's self in his sight, that is uprightly. Thus
Hen^ch, Genesis 5. 22. 24. No^h, Genesis 6. 9. Abraham and Is^ack, Genesis 48. 15.
David, and others, are said to have walked before God. Of David it is said,
that he walked before God in truth and righteousness and uprightness of
heart, 1 Kin. 3. 6, of Ezekias, 2 King. 20. 3. that he walked before God in
truth with a perfect, that is an upright heart. For you are not so to
understand it, as if Ezekias had no imperfections. For when the Lord left him a
little unto himself, that he might try him, and know, that is, make known
unto him what was in his heart; he rendered not again according to the benefits
done to him, but h^s heart was lifted up with pride, 2 Chronicles. 32. 24, 25, 31.

From this example of Ezechias, as it were, from the less, Bellarmine
infers. If Ezechias walked before God with a perfect heart, who will deny it
to Abraham, to whom it was said, walk before me and be perf^ct.

Answ. I doubt not, but Abraham did walk before God* that is to say, was
perfect or upright. For so much the Scriptures testify of him, Genesis 24. 40.
and 26. 5. and 48. 15. and that he was the friend of God, 2 Chr^. 20. 7. Esai.
41. 8. Iam. 2. 23. But Bellarmines proof is very slender; that Abraham was
such, because he was required so to be. For so the whole people of Israel
(which for the uprightness required in them, was called Iesh^run, Deuteronomy. 32.
15. and 33. 5, 26.) are exhorted, Deuteronomy. 18. 13. thou shall be perfect, that is,
upright with the Lord thy God. Ios. 24. 14. serve him in perfection and in
truth. 1 Samuel 12. 24. In truth with all your heart. And thus it appears, that
the terms of perfect heart and whole heart in the places before mentioned, do
not import any legal perfection, but uprightness and integrity of hear^:
which though it be but a perfection inchoated, or begun, being only a
perfection in respect of the par^s, and not of the degrees, toward which
notwithstanding it aspireth* yet nevertheless it is the Evangelicall, the
Christian, and the best perf^ction, which we can attain unto this life.

. XVII. These were his proofs out of the Scriptures. Now De justif. l. 4. cap.
12.
he will pr^ve out of the Fathers, that the Law of God is not impossible, His
testimonies out of the Fathers.
he should say, (for so he propounded the state of the question) absolutely
pos^ble.

But ^he Fathers may be distinguished into two ranks. For either they we^
such, as wrote before Pelagius spread his error, or after. Those wh^h wrote
before, did as Contr. Julian Pelag. lib. 1. c. 2.
Augustine says, write more carelessly of thee things: insomuch that (...)
would seem to father his errors up^ them. Those who wrote after he had
broached his heresies, as na^ely Hierome in his latter days, and Augustine,
had the like controvere, though not altogether the same with Pelagius, that we
have with the ^apists. For both do hold the same assertion, that the Law is
possibl^ both do use the like arguments, and both do abuse the same
Test^onies of Scripture to confirm their error.

. XVIII. There are, I confess, two seeming differences between The difference
between the Pelagian^ and Papists not great.
the P^agians and the Papists. The one, that the P^lagians held, that a man ^y
strength of nature might fulfill the Commandments of God, which ^e Papists
deny. The other, that a man might so fulfill the Law of God, as that he might
live without si^, which the Papists also deny. But if it (...) considered, that
the Pelagia^s did call the power of nature Gods grace and did acknowledge, that
the direction and instruction, which men have by the Word and Law of God was to
be ascribed to Gods grace; and that the grace of God does help men more
easily to obey the Law o^ God: i^ will appear, that there is no such great
differenc^ in the fo^er respect, as is pretend^d.

Again, the (...) between the Pelagians and Papists is not in respect of
(...) or impossibility, but in respect of greater or less difficulty. For the
Papists do^ not a^knowledge, that men by nat^re are dead in sin, ^d utterly
deprived of the Spiritual life: but that they are sick and weak, and ^yed
with the bands of sin, so that they cannot fulfill the Law of God, unless
they (...) ^olpen and loosed by grace: but being helped by grace, then the
fulfilling of the Commandments is easy to them. The Pelagians likewise
confess, that by the grace of God, which they call bonum naturae, or the power
or possibility of nature, they were enabled; by the grace of God vouchsafed in
his Word and Law, guided and directed; by the justifying grace of God freed
from the bond of their sins; and by the Sanctifying grace of God helped with
more ease to fulfill the Commandments of God. So that the Papists, although
they do not with the Pelagians deny original sin, or the necessity of
saving grace: yet they do extenuate the original corruption, and so magnify
the strength of nature, that they differ not much from them. For whereas
original corruption is both a privation of the habit of original
righteousness, and also an evil and wicked disposition and pronenesse to all
manner o^ sin, infecting all the parts and faculties of the soul: they make
the ^rivation to be of the act only and not of the habit or power; as if it
were not a mere impotencie to that which is spiritually good, but a dfficulty:
the evil disposition, either they altogether deny, saying that ^iginall sin
is only carentia justitiae debit ae in esse the want of original
^ighteousnesse; or else they so extenuate it, that they make it to be lose than
any venial sin, and in the regenerate no sin at all. But Au^ustine does
truly teach against both Pelagians and Papists, that man by ^nne lost both
bonum possibilitatis, and also possibilitatem non peccandi: as I will
hereafter. 20.
show.

And as touching the other difference^ though the Papists hold, ^at a man
cannot be altogether without sin for any long time, tho^h for some short
time (in which short time, if he shall say he has no sine, he shall make Saint
Io^n, and not himself a liar, 1 Ioh. 1. 8.) yet ^ey say, they may be without
all si^nes, excepting those which they do ^all venial: which they do so
extenuate, that indeed they make the^ no sins, as being no anomies or
transgressions of the Law com^tted against the Law, or repugnant to Charity,
but only besides the ^aw; such as may well stand together with perfect
inherent righteo^esse. For they say, he only is a righteous man in whom there
is no si^e, and yet that there is no man so righteous, as that he lives
without ^ese venial sins. But if they be (...) and not contrary to the Lw,
then they are neither commanded nor forbidden, and so no sins ^t all, but
(...), things indifferent.

. XIX. But let us examine his testimonies, two wh^reof are scarce worth the
examining; the one out of In Ios. h^mil. 9. in sin. in c. 8. 35.
Orig^n, the other out of Cyrill; and yet both of them so little to his purpo^,
as the^seeme to make against him, rather than for him. Orig^ compares ^to
women such men, as say they are not able to observe certain p^epts of Christ;
which the Papists do not call precepts, but Counells, and therefore belong not
at all, as they teach, but to those who would be thought to live in a state of
perfection. Besides which notorio^s hypocrites, all in the Church of Rome are
by this testimony to be ^ompared to women; who not only say they cannot, but
also think ^hey need not to observe them as to sell all that a man has and
give it to the poor (which indeed is neither a commandemen^, nor counsel
given by Christ unto all, but a precept of trial to that one wealthy
justitiary) Mat* 19. 21.
to him that strikes thee on the one cheek turn to him the other also;
bless him that curses thee, pray for him that persecuteth thee, and such
like; which are indeed precepts given to all the faithful, and not counsels
directed only to such, as are, or would seem to be perfect.

Cyrill. Cont. Julian. lib. 3.
says he, affirms that the precept it self, thou shall not lust, which is
noted to be most diffic^lt, may through grace be fulfilled. Answ. That place of
Cyrill, as it is translated into Latin, is in a manner without sense: neither
can any thing be soundly inferred from it. He^ seems to say, that Christ
restoring man's nature to his original perfection (which is but begun in this
life) said* To them of old it was said, thou shall not commit adultery, but I
say unto you, thou shall not lust; quamvis res sit, ut ^pinor, ad qu^m pertingi
nequeat, though it be a thing, as I suppose, which cannot be attained unto
(namely in this life) yet to this perfection Christ has reformed or restored
us, viz. inchoative in this life, and perfectly in the life to come.

. XX. The rest of the testimonies are of ^wo sorts: for either To the rest of
Fathers.
they deny the commandments of God to be impossible, as B^sil. orat. in illud,
attend tibi, Deuteronomy. 15. 9. Hier^e. ^dvers. Pelag. lib. 3. and in Matthew. 5.
(...). de Natura and gratia, Cap 43. etc. or else they affirm, that they are
possible, if men would, as C^ncil. Ar^sican. 2. Can. ult. Hil^ru in Psalm. 118.
Chrys^stom. in Matthew ^om. 39. and in Hebr. homil. 16. etc.

Answ. To preserve these fathers from contradicting themselves, certain
distinctions are to be admitted. For the same men, who de^y the law to be
impossible, do con^esse Hier. adv. Pelag. l. 3. Aug. de Not. and gr. cap. 43.
De Great. and lib. arb. cap. 6.
that God commands some things which we cannot do, and that never any since
the fall of Adam did, or could fulfill the whole law of God; and that there is
no man that lives without sin. Their meaning therefore is, that although no
man can fulfill the law, yet it is not impossible. The first distinction is
that, which I mentione^ before, b^twixt the perfect fulfilling, and the upright
keeping of Gods commandments, for although they cannot in this life be
fulfilled in that p^rfection, which the law requires: yet they may, and
usually are kept of the faithful in sincerity and upright^esse, which the Lord
in the covenant of grace acceptech. The second is conser^ing impossibility. For
when it is said, that the law is impossible to be fulfilled p^ctly; it is
either understood simply and per se, as the fathers understood it, as it is
impossible, says Basil, for the eye of a man to see his own back; or
conditionally and per accidens in respect of man's condition or estate. For the
law was possible to man in his integrity, when he was in the earth by Paradise
before his fall; and shall be possible again, when he shall be fully renewed
in the heavenly Paradise. But to man being fallen into the state of
disobedience, the fulfilling of the law is impossible by accident. For Romans 8.
7.
(...) the fleshly disposition of our corrupt nature, is not subject to the law
of God, neither can it be. The third distinction is in respect of the persons,
for men are either (...) unregenerate; or (...) regenerate. The regenerate man
by the grace of God is both willing and able to keep the law, according to the
measure of grace received. The unregenerate man is not able to keep the law,
because he will not; the very frame of his will being enmity against God. Romans
8. 7. Genesis 6. 5. and 8. 21. And here it is to be observed, that those fathers,
which had to do with the Pelagians, who held that men by strength of nature
were able to fulfill the Law of God, or else the Lord commandiug them
unpossible things should be unjust, neither should the fault be in men who
cannot obey, but in God who enjoyneth impossible things: did grant unto them,
that God did not command impossibilityes: yet they did hold (which the Papists
also confess) that no man without grace could perform them. For indeed to an
unregenerate man, who is dead in sin, it is as unpossi^le to fulfill the
w^ole law of God which is spiritual; as it is for a dead man to perf^rme the
actions of the natural life. For as I said before out of Augustine Hypognost.
l. 3.
man by his sin has lost not only bonum possibilitatis, so that ^ee can do
no good; but also De Not. and gra. cap. 48.
possibilitatem non peccandi, so that he cannot but sin, though he sin
most freely. For this is the freedom of a man not regenerate, qua potest
peccare, and non potest non peccare, (...) dam nabiliur, says the Master Lib.
2. did. 25. F. G.
of the sentences, whereby he is able to sin, and can do no other but
sin, and that damnably.

. XXI. And further to those testimonies which affirm that Answ. to those
testimonies which affirm, that men may fulfill the law if they will.
men may fulfill the commandments if they will: I answer that nothing can be
inferred from thence u^lesse it be proved, that men at all times are willing to
fulfill them. For if they be not willing they are not able, and much less do
they actually perform them. Thus therefore they must argue.

To them that are allwaies willing to keep the commandments, the Law is not
impossible.

But all men are always willing to keep the Commandments:

Therefore to no man is the Law impossible.

The proposition is not generally true in respect of the regenerate themselves:
unto whom to will is oftentimes present, when how to perform that which is
good, they find not R^m. 7. 18. For the good that they would they do not, and
the evil which they would not, that they do v. 19.

But the assumption is manifestly false, and the contrary is generally true. No
man is allwaies willing etc. And therefore from those Testimonies wherein the
condition of the will is interposed, nothing can be concluded for the absolute
possibility of fulfilling the Law, but rather against it. For those who are not
at all times so willing as they ought to be to fulfill the Law, they cannot
allwaies fulfill it. But no man is at all times so willing as he ought to be to
fulfill the Law. Augustine De pec^at. merit. and remiss. Cap. 14.
averreth N^minem esse qui tantum velit (...) res exigit. therefore no man is
able allwaies to fulfill it. For although perhaps he could, if he would,
(which as even now I said is not generally true of the regenerate themselves:)
yet whiles he will not, he cannot. For the will of obeying is the chief part
of obedience. The meaning therefore of those Fathers is, that the impossibility
of the Law is not to be ascribed to the Law, as if it were not possible, but to
the will of man who will not obey it.

XXII. Now that the Fathers, who deny the Law to be impossible That the fathers
did not mean that the Law is absolutely po^ible.
do not mean, that it is absolutely possible to be perfectly fulfilled,
appears by these reasons. First, because they yielded so far to the
objection of the Pelagians, as not to deny it to be possible to the
unregenerate, as I noted before. Secondly, because they held, that all men are
sinners, and that no man in this mortal life can live without sin, and
consequently, without transgressing the Law. Now it is manifest, that he who
transgresses the Law does not fulfill it. But when we thus argue Bellarmine
says we confound two questions, which ought not to be confounded: whether the
Commandments may be kept, and whether a man may live without sin* which
questions are so different, that to the former ^gustine always answered
affirmatively, to which purpose ^ee cites. D^ peccat. merit. and remiss. lib.
2. cap. 3. and 6. De N^tur. and gratia. c. 69. De gratia and lib. arbitr. c.
16. in Psalm. 56. And to the latter, negatively, to which purpose he quoteth
Lib. de Nature. and gratia. cap. 34. De spiritu and litera cap. ult. contr. 2.
Epistolas Pelag. c. 14. Epist. 89. and 95. and the whole book de perfectione
justiti^.

A^sw. This say I, is a plain evidence, that Augustine, when he says (which
we also say) that a man may keep the Commandments, means not the perfect
fulfilling of the Law. For if the question be propounded concerning the perfect
fulfilling of the Law, it is the same in effect with the other. For he that
perfectly fulfilleth the Law does undoubtedly live without ^nne: and he that
does not live without sin, does not perfectly fulfill the Law. Wherefore the
affirmation of the one question understood of perfect fulfilling, and the
Negation of the other, does imply a contradiction.

Thirdly, Because the fathers explane their meaning, when they say that the Law
is possible, and that a man may keep the commandments, not in respect of the
perfect fulfilling: but partly, in respect of the since^e study and upright
endeavor to perform: and partly in respect of Gods mercy in Christ, pardoning
what is wanting in their obedience. So says Augustine, Contr. 2. Epist. Pelag.
lib. 3. c. 7
hic studium pracepta servandi gratia Dei tribuit, qu^ si quid etiam in eis
pr^ceptis minus serv^tur, ignoscit. Here the grace of God bestows the study
of keeping the precepts: which also, if any thing in those precepts be not
kept, it pardons and which I cited before, Retract. l. c. 19.
all the commandments are reputed to be done when whatsoever is not done, is
pardoned: And elsewhere he says, De (...). Dei l. ^9. c 27*
that our righteous^esse in this life does consist rather in remission of sins,
than in perfection of virtues. For as touching perfection, he says, Contr. 2
Epis^olas Pelag. lib. 3. cap. 7.
V^rtutem quae nu^ est in homine justo, perfectam hactenus nominare, ut ad ejus
perfectionem pertineat, etiam ipsius imperfectionis and in veritate agnitio,
and in humilitate confessio* that the virtue, which now is in a just man, is ^o
far forth called perfect, that to the perfection thereof appertains, both
the acknowledgment of the imperfection there of in truth, and the conf^ssion of
it in humilily.

. XXIII. But he^e Bellarmine holds a strange para^oxe. That although a man
cannot live without sin, yet he may perfectly fulfill the B^llarmines ^paradox,
that a man may fulfill the Law, though he cannot live without sin.
Law of God. The absurdity whereof he hops to salve with the distinction of
sins into venial and mortal; because venial sins, without which none are
in this life, do not hinder the fulfilling of the Law. But this distinction
will not serve his turn, unless he can prove that venial sins are no
sins. For if they be sins, they are transgressions of the Law. And if they
be transg^essions of the Law, as undoubtedly they are, or else they 1 Io^. 3. 4.
be no sins; then he that cannot live wit^out them, cannot live without
transgression of the Law; and he that cannot live without transgression of the
Law, cannot perfectly fulfill it. I will not enter into the full discussing of
this question at this time, because it is another controversy; only for the
clearing of the point in hand, I do avouch according to the S^riptures, that
the wages of sin or stipend, Romans 6. 23. the (...) the just recompense of
reward Heb. 2. 2. is death, and that the least sin, according to the sentence
of the Law, if it be a sin, makes a man subject to the curse of God Gal. 3.
10. And that as every sin deserves death and therefore in it self is
mortal: so every sin is punish^d with death, either with the death of the
party who has no part in Christ, to whom all sins are mortal: or with the
death of Christ, as the sins of those who are his members; to whom their
sins, which in their own nature are mortal, become venial, as being
already punished in Christ, and the justice of God satisfied for them by the
satisfaction given by Christ: whose blood does cleanse us 1 Ioh. 1. 7, 8. Tit.
2. 14.
from all our sins, both great and small, none being so small, but that it is
of sufficient weight to press down the sinner to hell, being of infinite guilt,
committed against infinite justice, deserving infinite punishment, for which
the justice of God cannot be satisfied, but by a propitiation of infinite
value. Thus therefore I reason. That sinn^ which is punished with the death of
Christ is in it self mortal; all and every, even ^he least, sin of the
faithful is punished with the death of Christ: therefore all and every, even
the least sin of the faithful is in it self mortal.

But Bellarmine has a conceit, De justi^. l. 4. c. 14. ad 4.
that venial sins are not simply si^nes, nor against the Law, but besides
it. I answer. First, that which is besides the Law is an aberration from it,
and a declination from it ^ither to the right hand, or to the left, and that is
(...)* and is Deuteronomy. 5. 32. and 28. 14.
absolutely forbidden. Secondly, to do that which is besides the Law, is not
to do that, which is commanded, but he that does not the thing commanded,
that does not all, that does not continue in doing all is subject to the curse.
Thirdly, Whatsoever is not agreeable or conformable to the Law is (...), that
is a sin. But that which is besides the Law is not conformable unto it;
therefore it is a sin, and a transgression of the Law, which whosoever
commits, he does not fulfill the Law.

Fourthly, Things forbidden in the Law are against the Law. Those, which they
call venial sins, are forbidden in the Law. For either they are forbidden,
or commanded, or neither forbidden, nor commanded. If they be commanded, then
are they duetyes and not sinners: if neither commanded, nor forbidden, then are
they (...) things indifferent; it remains therefore that they are forbidden.

. XXIV. Now because the proof of this point, that the fulfilling Testimonies
of the Fathers that the law is not possible to be fulfilled of us.
of the Law is not possible unto us, is a matter of great consequence; for
thereby the popish doctrine of justification by inherent righteousness in
general, and by works in particular is evidently confuted; I will to those
arguments heretofore Lib. 4 cap. 5.. 5. etc.
used, add the testimonies of antiquity, in requital of Bellarmines
allegations out of the Fathers.

First, Therefore Justin Martyr Dialog. cum (...), page 98.
says, that never any man did accurately perform all the things that are
commanded. (...).

Secondly, Eusebius Caesariensis demonstrates Demonstr. Evang. l. 1.
that things required in (...) to all men impossible.

Thirdly, Ambrose. In Gal. 3.
Tanta mandata sunt, ut impossible sit servari ea, so great things are
commanded, that it is impossible they should be kept, whence Peter in the Acts
of the Apostles says, why do you impose a yoke upon the brethren, which
neither our fathers, nor we were able to bear.

Fourthly, Chrysostom: In Romans 10. 4. hom. 17.
what did the Law intend? to make a man just, but it was not able, (...) for no
man did fulfill it.

2. No man In verse. 5.
could be justified by the Law, unless he fulfilled all (...) But this was
not possible to any man, therefore that righteousness it self is quashit. 3.
That the Apostle In Gal 3.
by Testimony cited out of Deuteronomy. proves (...) that no man has fulfilled the
Law.
Hierome and Augustine in this point deliver the same things against the
Pelagians, which we do against the Papists.

Fifthly, Quoniam a. says Hierome, Lib. 2. in Gal. 3. 10.
nemo potest implere legem, that no man can fulfill the Law, and do all things
that are commanded, the Apostle testifies also elsewhere. For that which was
impossible of the Law, in that it was weak through the flesh Romans 8. 3. etc.

2. This is the only perfection of men Ad Ctesiph^nt. advers. Pelag. 254.
if they know themselves to be unperfect. And you, says he, when you have
done all, say, we are unprofitable servants, we have done what was our duty
to do. If he be unprofitable who has done all, what is to be said of him who
was not able to fulfill? 3. And again, thou say the Commandments of God are
easy, and tamen nullum proferre potes qui universa compleverit, and yet can
bring forth none that has fulfilled them all. 4. God, Ibid. 255.
says the Pelagian, has given possible Commandments and who denies this?
but how this sentence is to be understood the vessel of election most
plainly teaches, that which was impossible of the Law, in that it was weak
through the flesh, and c* that is, that the Law is not simply impossible, but
by reason of the flesh, that which was possible before the fall, is since the
fall impossible, by reason of man's coruption. 5. When Ibid. 256.
the Pelagians said, that although no man be without sin, yet he might be
without sin; what kind of arguing says he, is this, posse esse quod nunquam
fuerit, that that may be which never was: posse fieri quod nullum fecisse
testeris, that that may be done which your self testify never any man did,
and to attribute that I know not to whom, which you can never prove to have
been in the Patriarchs, or Prophets, or Apostles. 6. That Contr. Pelag. lib
1. 264. in^ llud M^t. 19. si vis esse perse cius.
which our Savior Christ says, if thou will be perfect, is said to him, who
could not, yea, would not, and therefore could not. 7. Then Ibib. 265.
are we just, when we confess our selves to be sinners; and our righteousness
consists not of our own merit, but of Gods mercy. 8. If Lib. 2. advers.
Pe^ag. 283.
we do not that which we would, but work that which we would not, how say
ye, that a man may be without sin, if he will? Behold the Apostle and all
believers are not able to accomplish what they would. 9. Having cited many
testimonies, to prove, that no man is justified by the works of the Law, all
these, says he, Ibid. 284. f.
I run through ut ostendam a nullo legem esse im^letam, that I might show
that the Law is fulfilled of none; meaning by the Law all the Commandments
which are contained in the Law. 10. If you Lib. 3. 298.
can show the man, who has fulfilled all, then may you show a man, who needs
not Gods mercy. 11. The In Psalm. 67.
Law is made weak, quoniam nemo potest i^plere eam, nisi Dominus, because none
but our Lord can fulfill it.
VI. Augustine De spiritu, and litera. c. 36.
says, that to that immortal life appertains that precept; thou shall love
the Lord thy God with all thine heart, with all thy soul, and with all thy
might: but to this life let not sin reign in your mortal bodies to obey the
lusts thereof, to that life, thou shall not lust: to this, thou shall not go
after thy lusts.

2. God does Ibid.
so work righteousness in his Saints laboring under the temptation of this
life, that notwithstanding there remains, both what he may largely add to
them when they ask, and also what he may mercifully forgive, when they
confess. 3. In the same chapter, he had said, that the two Commandments of
loving God with all our heart, and our neighbors as our selves, we shall
fulfill, when we shall see face to face. But, says he, the same is now
commanded us, ut admoneremur quid fide exposcere, quo spem praemittere; ut
oblivis^endo quaeretro sunt, in quae anteri^ra nos extendere debeamus, that we
might be admonished, what by faith to desire, whether to send before our hope,
unto what things which are before we should preasse forward, forgetting what is
behind. 4. That the virtue Contr. 2. epistolas Pelag. lib. 3. cap. 7.
which now is in a just man is so far to be called perfect, that to the
perfection thereof there belongs the acknowledgment of its imperfection in
verity and the confession thereof in humility; for then this petite justice is
according to its small measure infirmely perfect, when it understands what is
wanting to it self. And therefore the Apostle says, both that he is
unperfect, and that he is perfect: unperfect, considering how much he wanted
unto justice, the fullness whereof he did as yet hunger after and thirst,
perfect, both because he is not asha^ed to confess his imperfections, and
goes forward well that he may attain unto it. 5. Surely, he that is renewed
from day to day 2 Cor. 4. 16.
(which is the cause of the most regenerate) is De peccat. merit. and remiss.
l. 2. c. 7.
not yet wholly renewed, and how much he is not yet renewed, so much he is in
his old estate, etc. 6. It is De temp. sermon. 45.
the fullness of virtue, which the Law says, thou shall not covet, hoc, modo
impleri non potest, this now cannot be fulfilled. 7. So long Epist. 29.
as love may and ought to be increased (as in this life always it may and
ought) certainly, that which is less than it ought to be is faulty, by reason
of which faultiness there is not a just man upon the earth, that does good and
sins not. By reason of which faultiness no man living shall be justified in
Gods sight, etc.
VII. Sedulius In Romans 10.
upon those words, for Christ is the end of the Law etc, that is, says he,
perfectionem legis habet qui credit in Christ^, he has the perfection of the
Law who believes in Christ. For seeing no man was justified by the Law, quia
nemo imple^at legem, because none did fulfill the Law, etc.

VIII. Oecumenius, In Gal. 3.
for this cause they, who adhere to the Law are accursed, (...), because they
are not able to fulfill the Law.

IX. Bernard, In Cantic. sermon. 50.
neither was the Lawgiver ignorant, that the weight of the Commandment did
exceed the strength of men, but he judged it profitable, that by this means
they might be admonished of their insufficiency, and that they might know
unto what end or perfection of righteousness they ought, according to their
ability, strive, wherefore mandando impossibilia by commanding things
impossible, he made not men transgressors, but humble, etc.

2. Therefore In vigil. Nativit. Dei sermon. 2.
he has straightly commanded his Commandments to be kept, that seeing our
imperfection to be defective, and non posse implere quod d^bet, that it cannot
fulfill what it ought, we might flee to mercy.

X. Thomas Aquinas The. Aqui. in Gal. 3.
on those words Gal. 3. 10. For it is written, Cursed, etc. he proves, says
he, his purpose, viz. that no man can be justified by the works of the Law,
quia nullus potest servare legem because no man can keep the Law in that
manner that the Law prescribes, Deuteronomy. 27. because every one is accursed, who
does not continue in all things which ar^ written in the book of the Law to
do them, that is, who does not fulfill the whole Law. Sed implere totam legem
est impossible, but to fulfill the whole Law it is impossible.

XI. Cardinal C^sanus Exercit. l. 10. sermon. in parasceue page 664.
Nemo vunquam adimplevit legem never any man fulfilled the Law which consists
in love, but Christ only, who came not to break the Law but to fulfill it.

Against all these the sacred Council of Trent Sess. 6. can. 18.
denounces Anathema.

CAP. VII. De justif l. ^: cap. 13.
Bellarmines six reasons to prove that the Law of God is absolutely possible,
answered and refuted.
. I.

NOW I come to Bellarmines Reasons, which are in Reason 1. because a man may
do more than is commanded.
number six. The first, A man may do more than is commanded; therefore much
more he is able to fulfill the Commandment. The antecedent he proves by
three testimonies. The first of Christ, Matthew. 19. Who after he had said, if
thou will enter into life, keep the Commandments, and the party had answered,
all these I have kept from my youth; he says unto him again, Mat. 19. 21.
if thou will be perfect, go and sell all that thou have, etc. The second of
Chrysostom, who says, De panit. hom 8.
that many exceed the Commandments. The third of Augustine, De verbis Apestoli
sermon. 18.
who says, no great burden is imposed upon Virgins: greater love has imposed
a greater weight. As if they should say, what do thou command? that we should
not be adultresses? Is this that, which thou command? In love to thee we
do more than thou command.

I answer by distinction. For when he says a man may do more than is
commanded; that more may be understood either extensive, to things not
commanded at all; or inte^sive, in respect of things commanded, but done in
greater perfection, than is commanded. And thus he means either some special
Commandment, or the whole Law. If he mean the whole Law, I deny the
antecedent. For I have proved that no mortal man is able to fulfill the whole
Law, and much less to do more. The Law of God is a perfect rule of
righteousness, unto which nothing can or ought Deuteronomy. 4. 2: and 12. 32. Prove.
30. 6.
to be added. And to him that goes about to add to Gods Law God will add
Ap^c. 22. 18.
his judgments because he adds nothing but will worship and sin. And to
such it will be said, Who required these things at your hands? Neither is that
obedience to God, which God has not required. And this is the case of all the
religious Orders among the Papists, who profess greater perfection, than God
has required: the several Religions being so many by-ways misleading them
from that way, which leads to heaven. And this overthrows all their
superarrogant works of supererogation. For there can be no works of
supererogation over and above the Law, unless first the whole Law be
fulfilled, and then more be added thereunto. Neither of which can be done. If
he mean either things not commanded, or the duties of any one special
Commandment, then I deny the consequence. For as touching things not
commanded; it is manifest, that they who are addicted to will worship, do many
things not commanded, who notwithstanding neglect the things commanded, making
the Commandments of God of none effect Matthew. 15. 6.
through their traditions. And this is the condition of all popish Votarles,
who though they should fully observe the rules of their several Orders, yet
would be very far from fulfilling the whole Law of God. If he mean some
special Commandment, as by his proofs it seems he does, then also I deny
the consequence. For though ^ man should do more than is required in some
special Commandment; yet he would be defective in respect of others: and
he that fails in any, is guilty of all.

. II. But I suppose it would be hard for any Papist to show, that Whether in
any moral duty more can be well performed than is commanded.
in respect of any necessary moral duty more can be laudably performed, than
is by duty required. For whatsoever can be done, it is either commanded of
God, or forbidden, or neither commanded nor forbidden. If it be forbidden, it
is evil, and not to be done. If it be commanded, it cannot be done in
greater perfection, than God in his Law does require it to be done. If it be
neither commanded nor forbidden, then it is in it own nature indi^erent; and
therefore in respect of our Christian liberty free, either to be done, or to
be left undone. But because our liberty is not a loose licentiousness, but a
true liberty, bounded with the Laws of piety and charity; therefore we are so
to use or forbear the use of these things, as that therein we do not offend
against either piety or charity. If therefore we shall use these things as
means or helps to perform the duties either of piety or charity, or refuse
them as impediments to either, having either in the using or refusing respect
to the glory of God, to the good of our selves or of our brethren: we shall
do more than is commanded in respect of the particular thing it self, which
is simply neither commanded nor forbidden* but not more in respect of the
general laws of piety and charity* which as they command us to love God with
all our souls, and our neighbor as our selves, and forbid the contrary vices:
so they command all the means and helps which may be used for the p^formance
of these duties of piety and charity, and forbid both all impediments of the
duties commanded, and also all provocations to the evils forbidden. Now in
these things which are neither simply commanded nor forbidden, counsels have
place, either for the using or refusing of them, as shall be most for Gods
glory, the benefit of our brethren, and our own spiritual good: which
counsels as it is a virtue to obey, so to disobey them is a sin: and
consequently the observer of them does no more than he ought to do. And
therefore the Papists whiles they enjoyne the observation of the counsels only
to them who would seem to live in a state of perfection, they teach all others
to sin by disobeying them, as not being tied to the observation of them. As
for example, not to swear in ordinary communication, not to revenge, nor to
resist evil, to bless them that curse us, to pray for them that persecute us,
and many such like, among which they reckon the eigth beatitudes, Matthew. 5. 3.
etc. In which a good part of the power of Religion consists. So that to
swear ordinarily in common talk, to seek private revenge and such like are
no sins with the Papists.

. III. But let us come to his proofs. The first whereof is, Mat. His first
proof^* Matthew. 16. 21.
19. 21. If thou will be perfect, Go and sell all that thou have, etc. upon
which place they ground their counsel of voluntary poverty. But it is evident
by that which before I have said, that this was not a precept or counsel given
to all, that would aspire toward perfection (which is the duty and property
of all true Christians) but a precept of trial directed in special to that
rich Iustitiary, to discover unto him his own imperfection^. Or if it had been
but a counsel, according to the popish co^ruction, given to one that had
already fulfilled all the Comma^ements (which no man can be said to have
fulfilled until he ^ave fulfilled his course) then had it been no sin for
him not to obey this counsel, nor any hinderance to his salvation. For having
fulfilled all the Commandments, as the Papists conceive of him, he might enter
into life, though he did not this, which here he is advised unto. But he
sinned in disobeying this precept of trial; which if he had obeyed, he had
done no more than in duty he was bound to do, having received a special
Commandment to that purpose. Neither had he fulfilled those Commandments,
which he says he had kept from his youth, otherwise than according to the
interpretation of the Scribes and Pharisees; and consequently according to
their righteousness, which whosoever does not Matthew. 5: 20.
exceed shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven, and much less had he
fulfilled all the Commandments of God. For by disobeying this Commandment of
Christ, he plainly bewrayed himself to be a transgressour of the first and
last Commandments: yea, that he did not truly affect and prize his own
salvation, but being a mere worldling preferred the love of his pelf to the
love of God, and desired rather to enjoy his worldly wealth for a short time,
than to obtain and for ever to enjoy the heavenly treasures, which Christ
promised him, if he would follow Him. And for this his sin in disobeying
Christ his entrance into heaven was hindered. Insomuch that of him, and all
such as he was, our Savior gives this Matthew. 19 24.
censure, that it is easier for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle,
than for a rich man (that sets his heart upon riches, as this man did) to
enter into the kingdom of God.

. IV. As for their counsel and vow of voluntary poverty: Counsel of voluntary
poverty.
though I will not insist thereupon, it being another controversy: yet thus
much briefly will I say. First, that it has no ground in the Scriptures; and
therefore being obtruded as a matter of Religion, it is mere will worship,
which is neither acceptable to God, nor availeable to themselves. Secondly, as
it is practiced among the Papists it is nothing worth, being done neither out
of the love of God, nor of their neighbor: but out of a Pharisaicall conceit*
by their works of supererogation to make God their debtour. For as the Apostle
says, If I should bestow all my goods to ^eed the poor, and have not charity,
it would profit me nothing. 1 Cor. 13. 3. Thirdly, it is repugnant to the
Scriptures and namely to the eigth, the fifth and second Commandment. In the
eigth Commandment (as I could show) there is required a moderate desire of
temporal blessings, avoiding the contrary extremes of cove^ing too much, or of
affecting voluntary poverty. And accordingly we are to frame our prayers and
our practice. Our prayer, as our Savior Matthew. 6. 11: Luke 11. 3.
has taught us to beg of God (...) that is, that portion of temporal
blessings, which God in his wisdom does know to be expedient for us, that
is, as Agur prays, Prove. 30, 8. Give me neither poverty (or beggary as the
Latin renders it) nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me. Where
Lechem ch^qqi is the very same with (...). Our practice, not to live idly
upon the sweat of other men's brows, as Friars mendicants and other lusty
beggars do; but every man's duty is, to work with his hands the thing that is
Ephesians. 4. 28.
good, that is, to earne his living by the lawful works of his lawful
calling, not only that he may eat his own bread, which our Savior teaches
us to beg of God, and the Apostle, to labor for, that we may eat our own
bread, 2 These. 3. 12. And the Psalmist promises as a blessing to him that
fears God, Psalm. 128. 2. For thou shall eat the labor of thine own hands:
but also that he may have to give to others, Ephesians. 4. 28. Therefore the
Apostle, Act. 20. 34, 35. exhorts the faithful, by laboring in their
lawful callings, to support the impotent, and to remember the words of our
Lord Jesus, for though the Papists esteem them to live in a state of
perfection who live in voluntary beggary; yet our Savior was wont to say, it
is a more blessed thing to give than to receive. And therefore a more blessed
estate it is to be able to give, than to live upon the alms of others.

The fifth Commandment teaches us to honor our private and our public
parents in the Church and common wealth, and the common mother of us all, that
is, our Country: all which we are to honor with our service and with our goods
as occasion is offered, and need requires; and not to behave our selves, as if
we were borne for our selves alone, neglecting others whom we ought to honor.
And therefore by this their counsel the Papists teach men (especially when they
take young men or women into their Cloisters against the liking of their
parents) to break the Commandment of God as the Matthew. 15. 4, 5, 6.
Pharisees did. Neither can they truly say, that they help others with their
devotion, Mark. 7. 10, 11, 12, 13.
for their devotions* are superstitious and Idolatrous: or if they were good,
they needed not to go into a Cloister to perform them, which might and ought
to be afforded in a lawful calling.

The second Commandment under that one kind, of making to our Non facias tibi.
selves images, forbids willworship and all devised means of Gods worship
Cor* 2. 22, 23.
according to the doctrine and inventions of men: as all the religions of those
manifold orders among the Papists, are willworship and superstition. And under
that one kind of worshipping of Images or of God by them he condemns all
false and counterfeit worship, and namely hypocrisy, but the seeming poverty
of popish votaries is hypocritical. For under the profession of voluntary
poverty they live in all ease and abundance. For although the several Monks
and Friars profess that they have nothing in their own proper possession, yet
they are rich in the common possessions of their Monastaries, which being many
times very large are employed for the maintenance of them. So that a carnal man
who makes no conscience of living incontinently in single life, and makes
account that he was borne for himself alone, has reason to choose this
monastical life above all others, as most likely to give contentment to his
idle and c^rnall disposition. Now then to obtrude this vowed poverty, which as
it has no ground in the scriptures, so it is repugnant thereunto in so many
respects, as a matter not only of religion, but also of satisfaction both for
themselves and others, of merit, of perfection, of supererogation, is a thing
to be detested as most wicked and Antichristian.

. V. As for his other testimonies: it is plain, that Chrysostom Of the
^ounsell and vow of single life.
and Augustine speak but of that one Commandment which forbids adultery.
But though a man were able to do more than that one Commandment requires:
yet it would not follow, that he were therefore able to do more than the
whole Law requires. But indeed in respect of that one Commandment more cannot
be done lawfully, than that Commandment prescribes: or if more should be
done, it would not be done in obedience to that Commandment. Indeed if you
respect only the outward letter of that commandment, as the Fathers did, it
being a prohibition of the external act of adultery: it cannot be denied, but
that all, who are not adulterers, have fulfilled that Commandment. But if
these two things be considered: first, that the Law is Romans 7. 14.
spiritual, and therefore forbids not only the outward act of adultery,
but all uncleannenesse whatsoever in tho^ght, in word, and indeed, insomuch
that he who looks Matthew. 5. 28.
on a woman to ^ust after her, has broken this Commandment: and secondly,
that this Commandment, as all the rest, has two parts, the negative
forbidding all uncleannenesse, the affirmative, commanding all 1 These. 4. 3, 4,
5.
chastity both outward, and also inward, which is the purity or cleannenesse of
the soul from all the lusts of the flesh: it must be granted, that nothing can
be added to the perfection of chastity, which this Commandment prescribes:
Yea, but the chastity in single life is more than is commanded. For the Law
forbids women to be adulteresses: but they that follow this counsel, v^w
perpetual virginity, which is more, as Saint Augustine says. It is more than
the letter of the negative forbidding only the outward act of adultery, does
require; but not more than the affirmative, being spiritually understood, does
prescribe. Which is to observe chastity in that condition wherein we live,
whether it be in single life or in marriage. Indeed no where is it simply
either commanded or forbidden to live, either in single life, or in wedlock,
it being in its own nature a thing indifferent. But chastity in both is
absolutely required. For there is a chastity of wedlock, as well as of single
life: though the Papists most wickedly oppose wedlock to chastity. Chastity, I
say, is simply commanded to all, as an especial ornament of the soul, from
whence it has its Ca^titas, (...)
name, being the purity and cleanenesse of the soul from all unlawful lusts.
But single life or marriage, are not simply either commanded or forbidden, but
to certain persons. For to them who have not the gift of continency, which
all have not, neither are all capable of (for so much is signified in the
Verb, (...), Matthew. 19. 11.) but only they to whom it is given, to them
marriage is commanded, as an holy ordinance of God, and as an holy remedy
against lust: and to them being not able to contain, continuance in single
life is forbidden. For the avoiding of fornication and all uncleanness, every
man 1 Cor. 7. 2.
that has not the gift of continency, is commanded to have his wife: and
every woman, that has not the gift of continency, is commanded to have her
husband. Of them who have the gift of continency, some are not fit for
procreation, but are impotent from their mothers womb, Math. 19. 12. to these
marriage is forbidden. Others are not unfit for procreation, and to those
whiles they have the gift of continency, which in very few who are fit for
procreation is perpetual, they are neither commanded to marry, nor to live
single, but as they find it to be expedient for them. And that estate, which
they find most expedient for the glory of God, and their own good, they are
to choose. And if they make choice of single life in love to God (whom they
cannot love sufficiently.) and to their own souls unto which they ought not
to be wanting, making themselves ^unuches for the Kingdom of God, Matthew. 19.
12. they in their choice do^ no more than they ought to do: they being bound
by the Law to that perfection of chastity, which no man in this life can
attain unto. For besides the external, there are two degres of inward
chastity: the one is a purity and cleanenesse of the soul, not only from all
passions, but also motions of lust, which are called (...) and this is pure and
perfect chastity, which we cannot attain unto whiles we are infected whith
original or habitual concupiscence, the other is called continency, which is
a virtue restrayning and repressing the concupiscences of the flesh, which 1
Pet. 2. 11.
war against our souls maintaining a continual warfare against them. To
this, those who have the gift of continency in some measure attain; but
notwithstanding come far short of that purity, which the Law of God requires.

. VI. As for the vowed chastity among the Papists: it is so The vowed single
life among the Papists a sinful state.
far from being a state of perfection, or supererogation, as that it is, for
the most part, a sinful state, and that in three respects. First, in respect
of making the vow. For it is sin to vow that, which a man does not know to be
lawful, or not in his own power, then does he sin with an high hand, not
only resolving, but also vowing to sin, and to continue therein. Secondly,
in respect of the performing the vow, when the thing vowed, viz. continency in
single life, does appear not to be in their power, and yet to perform their
vow of single life, live in incontinency and uncleanenesse. Many times it
falls out, that a man at the first does not know the thing vowed to be either
not lawful, or not in his power: yet because he does not know it to be lawful
and in his power, he sins by rash vowing: but when afterward it does
appear to be, either unlawful, or not in his power, he is not bound to keep
that vow, which rashly he made, but he is bound to break it: for by
performing it he adds sin to sin, and many times a greater sin to a
less, that is to the rashness of his vow, the incontinencie of his life. And
this is perpetual among the Popish votaries, who never dissolve their vow,
though the performance of it be never so wicked. Thirdly, because the vowed
single life among the Papists being for the most part so filthy and abominable,
that all the world cries shame upon them for their filthiness: yet by them is
obtruded unto God, as a matter not only of religion, and satisfaction, but
also of merit, of perfection, and supererogation.

And the like might be said of their vow of blind obedience. For simple and
absolute obedience is only to be vowed and performed to God. But to vow the
like toward any sinful man, who either does, or at least may command that
which is unlawful, as sometimes they do, to murder Princes, or to attempt
other traitorous practices, etc. and to think that in so doing he does merit
and supererogate, it is to forsake God.

. VII. His second reason: If the Commandments were impossible, they would
bind no man. And so the precepts should be no precepts: for His second
reason, if the precepts were not possible, they would bind no man.
it cannot be imagined, how any man should sin in that which he cannot
avoid, etc.

His reason is thus to be framed,
To that which is impossible no man is tied:
To the Commandments all men are tied:
Therefore the Commandments are not impossible.
The assumption, which no man denies, he proves, because if they did not
bind, they were no precepts, neither were the transgression of them a sin.

The proposition he proves, because it cannot be imagined how a man should
sin in that which he cannot avoid.

I answer, as heretofore, by distinction. That the Commandments are said to
be impossible, either simply, or by accident. If therefore the meaning of his
conclusion be, that the Commandments be not simply and absolutely impossible,
then I grant all, for we never held that the Commandments are simply
impossible: for to man, both before his fall, and after his resurrection, they
were and shall be absolutely possible. But since the fall they are impossible
in respect of the perfect performance in and by our selves, not simply, but by
reason of the flesh, that is to say, through our own default. For if we would
not have sinned in Adam, the Law had been possible unto us: but by our
voluntary sin we lost both (...) possibilitatis, and also possibilitatem non
peccand^. Now it were absurd to imagine, that our fault should free us from
obedience. Howbeit, even after the fall there is a distinction to be held
between men unregenerate in the corrupt state of nature, and the regenerate in
the state of grace. To the unregenerate the Law is impossible through their
own default, which does not lessen their sin: for they sin voluntarily and
many times of malice, as the devils also do: who though they have brought upon
themsel^es a necessity of sinning, so that they can do no other but sin: yet
this does not, as I said, extenuate their sin (for they commit sin with
greediness) but rather aggravate their finfulnesse. Those that are habituated
in sin, in whom custom is become as it were another nature, they can no more
of themselves cease from sinning, than a Black-moore can wash away his
blackenesse, Ier. 13. 23.

. VIII. Yea, but says Bellarmine, It cannot be imagined, how a Bellarmines
objectio^s that a man does not sin in that which he cannot avoid.
man should sin in that, which he cannot avoid. Answ. That seems to be
true in respect of the liberty of contradiction, but not in respect of the
liberty of contrariety. In respect of a sinful action a man has liberty to
do it or not to do it: which we call the liberty of contradiction. But he
has not liberty to do that which is good, his natural will enabling him
only to sin. So that although a natural man may abstain from this or that
sinful act: yet he sins in whatsoever he does, neither can he do any other
but sin. If therefore they do not sin, who are not able to fulfill the Law,
then all Infidels, yea all natural men, who c^n do nothing but sin, should
be exempted from sinning, which is absurd. To the regenerate man, as I said
before, the Law is possible, both in respect of his faith. For he that truly
believes in Christ has fulfilled the Law in Christ. Secondly, in regard of
his new obedience: and that in three respects. For first, his new obedience,
though it be not complete; yet it is obedientia inchoata: and though it be not
a fulfilling of the Law, yet it is an acceptable keeping thereof. Secondly,
though it be unperfect, and stained with the flesh, yet being ^ntyre, that is,
sincere and upright, it is in Christ accepted as perfect. Thirdly, because the
imperfection thereof being covered with Christ's perfect obedience, and cured by
his intercession, is remitted. Now all is esteemed done, when that which is not
done, is remitted.

. IX. His third reason: If God should command things impossible, he His third
reason, God should be more cruel and more foolish than any tyrant, etc.
should be more cruel (horresco referens) and more foolish than any tyrant: in
exacting atribute from his own friends, which none were able to pay, and
making such Laws, which he knew none were able to perform. But the Consequent
is blasphemous, therefore the antecedent. To the proposition I answer as
before by distinction. That if God should command things simply impossible,
there would besome color for his blasphemous consequence. But the Lord
commands nothing, but what to man in his first creation was absolutely
possible: neither does he exact any tribute which he did not make us able to
pay, nor make any law which we were not able to observe. And although now we
cannot in our selves fulfill it; yet God was not tied to accommodate his Law,
like a Lesbian rule, to our weakness contracted by our own default: but it
became him, to propound such Laws as were answerable to our first integrity,
describing what we were, and not what we are: that seeing from what we are
fallen, we might seek to be repaired in Christ, who is the end of the Law for
righteousness to every one that believes, Romans 10. 4. The covenant of works
God made with man in his state of integrity, when he was able to keep it. But
after the fall, because it was not possible that man should perform that
covenant in, and by himself, he in great mercy made with man the Covenant of
grace in Christ. But lest any man should either through ignorance or pride
neglect the benefit of the Messiah: it pleased God to renew the Covenant of
works, not to that end that men should be justified or saved thereby, but that
it might be a means to drive them unto Christ. And fo Bellarmine himself
has taught De iustif. l 4. c, 4.. Sextum discrimen.
Lex non data erat ut justificaret, sed ut morbum ^stenderet, and ad quaer^ndum
medicum excitaret. The Law was not given to that end that it should justify,
but that it might show the disease, and stirte up men to seek to the Physician.

Again a distinction is to be made, as in the answer to the second reason, of
the parties to whom the law is given. For to the wicked and reprobate, who are
Gods rebellious subjects, the law is indeed impossible through their own
default: and yet God exacteth most justly that righteousness in which he did
create them: he requires most justly an account of those talents which he
committed to them, though now they be not able to pay. The debt is duly
exacted of the debtour, though through his own default he be not now able to
make payment. As for the elect, whom the Lord has, before they were, loved in
Christ, he has given his law to them, not to this end, that either by the
observation thereof in their own persons they should be justified, or by the
breach thereof they should be condemned (for then who could be saved?) But the
use of the law to them before their conversion is, that it might be unto them
a Schoolmaster unto Christ: and after their conversion and justification, it
might be a rule whereby to frame their lives and conversation: aspiring
always toward that perfection which the law prescribes, though they cannot
fully attain unto it. Why then, says Augustine, De perfectione justiti^. 970.
should not this perfection be enjoined to man, though no man in this life
have it? Non enim recte curratur, si quo currendum est nesciatur. quomodo autem
sciretur, si nullis praeceptis ostenderetur. For men cannot run well, if they
know not whither they must run, and how should they know that, if by precepts
it be not made known to them? And worthy is that saying of Bernard InCantic
sermon. 50.
to be repeated again and again. Neither was the commander ignorant, that the
weight of the commandment does exceed the strength of men, but he judged it
profitable, that hereby they should be admonished of their own unsufficiencie,
and that they might know to what end (or perfection) of righteousness they
should aspire. Therefore by commanding impossible things he did not make men
transgressors, but humble, that every mouth may be stoppod Romans 3. 19. 20.
and the whole world made obnoxious to God. For by the works of the Law no
flesh shall be justified in his sight. For receiving the commandment, and
feeling our defectivenes, we shall cry to heaven, and God will have mercy on
us. And we shall know in that day, that not by the works of righteousness,
T^. 3. 5.
which we have done, but according to his mercy he has saved us. His fourth
reason collected out of three testimonies.


. X. His fourth reason is collected out of three places of scripture. Romans 8.
4. Mat. 6. 10. Heb. 5. 9. In the first it is said, that Christ suffered, that
the justification of the Law might be fulfilled in us. In the second, we are
taught to pray, that Gods will may be done upon earth, as it is in heaven. In
the third, that Christ is made to all that obey him the cause of eternal
salvation. But says he, if we can^t fulfill the Law, then Christ misseth of
his end. For notwithstanding his sufferings, the justification of the Law is
not fulfilled in us: neither is our prayer ever obtained, of fulfilling G^ds
will and commandments on earth as in heaven: neither is Christ the author of
salvation to any, because none obey him. The 1. place. Romans 8. 4.
Answ. As touching the first place: because it is often alleged by Bellarmine,
I will somewhat insist upon it. The place is two ways expounded, either of
sanctification, or of justification. Ifit be to be understood of
sanctification, as the Papists commonly expound it; we acknowledge, that our
sanctification is the end and fruit of our redemption by Christ, and that this
end is achieved i^ all those, who live not after the flesh but after the
Spirit, that is, in all true believers. I say it is archieved (...) in this
life, and perfectly in the life to come. But as I suppose, it is rather to be
understood of justification. For the Apostle having assured the faithful verse.
1. that notwithstanding sin, and the body of sin and of death (whereof he
had complained chap. 7.) remains in them; yet forasmuch as we are delivered
from the same by Jesus Christ our Lord verse. 25. there is no condemnation to
them which are in Christ, as his members, whom he describes by this
character, that they walk not after the flesh but after the Spirit: In the
verses following he confirms the same conclusion, showing how Christ has
delivered us. For says he verse. 2. the law of the Spirit of life in Christ
Jesus has delivered me from the law of sin and of death. Whereby the law of
the Spirit of life we understand the virtue and power of holiness or
sanctification not in us, but in Christ Jesus, (for so he says, though they
do not observe it, who understand this place of sanctification and
righteousness inherent) who by his righteousness and merits has delivered us
from the power of sin and of death. But the Apostle, as in the former chapter
verse. 24. so here in the singular number speaks of himself, teaching by his
own example every true Christian to apply the benefits of Christ to himself.
For that which was impossible for the law to do, that is, to justify us, in
that it was weak through the flesh; God sending his own son in the likeness
of sinful flesh, that is, in the humane nature subject to passions and
infirmities, and that for sin, that he might take away the sin of the
world (for so says (...) Romans 8.
(...)) condemned sin in the flesh, that is, exacted the due punishment of
sin in his humane nature, that the guilt of our sins being taken away by
his alsufficient satisfaction, (...) that which the law requires unto
justification might by Christ be fulfilled in us who are his members, which
walk not (as also he had said in the first verse) not after the flesh, but
after the Spirit.

. XI. As if the Apostle had said: Although the body of sin and The text Romans
8. expounded.
death remain in us, who are both justified; which made me cry out chap. 7.
24: yet forasmuch as we are delivered therefrom by Jesus Christ our Lord, to
whom all thanks is therefore due verse. 25. I do therefore now assure all the
faithful and true members of Christ (who may be known by this mark, that
they live not after the flesh but after the Spirit) that they are delivered
from damnation, and their salvation is sure. Now there are 2. things whereby
Christ has delivered us from the law of sin and death, that is, from the power
or guilt of sin and of death: the former is the power and merit of Christ's
perfect obedience and holiness, which is called the law of the Spirit of life in
Christ: the other his sufferings, wherein he yielded an allsufficient
satisfaction by bearing the punishment, whereby sin was condemned in our
nature which had sinned; which nature though (...) free from sin as
Chrysost^me Oecum. in Romans 8. (...)
speaks, yet like to the sinful flesh, that is to say, passible, he
therefore took upon him, that because by the observation of the law in our
own persons, it was impossible by reason of our flesh to be justified, all
which the Law required to justification, might, ^ee does not say by us, but in
us, that is in our nature be performed by Christ, for it is Christ, as Homil.
13. in Romans 8. 34.
Chrysost^me says, that fulfilled (...) in us and for us who are his true
members, and are to be known as I said by this mark, that live not after the
flesh but after the Spirit. And therefore this place proves, that because it
is impossible by reason of the flesh to be justified by that righteousness
which is prescribed in the Law: therefore God in his mercy sent his Son to
take our nature upon Him, that therein he might perform for us whatsoever the
Law it self required to justification. Thus this place is expounded by In Romans
8. 4.
Chrysostom, (...), says he, is (...), not to be subject to the curse, and
that Christ fulfilled it for us. In locum.
Oecumenius in like manner: If any man should say, what is this to us? He says,
these things Christ did, that the scope of the Law (for that is (...)) might be
fulfilled in us. And what is the scope of the Law? That we should not be
obnoxious to the curse. Or as In Romans 10. Hom. 17.
Chrysostom in another place: the end of the Law is that a man might be
justified. For what did the Law intend? To make a man just; but it was not
able, because no man fulfilled it. In locum.
Theodore^, when the Law was not able to perform what it intended by reason of
their weakness to whom it was given, -- the only begotten Word of God made
man, by the humane flesh overcame sin; having fulfilled all righteousness.
And being not infected with any blemish of sin, and having undergone the
death of sinners, as if he had been a sinner, etc. And on those words, that
the righteousness of the law might be in us: he paid our debt, says he,
and performed the end and scope of the law, What was that? That he might
declare them to be just (that is, that he might justify them) to whom the law
was given. In locum.
Ambrose, Quando impletur in ^bis justificati^ (Legis) nis^ cum datur remissi^
omnium peccatorum? when is the justification of the law fulfilled in us, but
when the remission of all our sins is granted to us? for as I have before
alleged out of R^tract. Lib. ^. cap. 19.
Augustine, All the Commandments are reputed done, when that which is not done
is pardoned. If therefore this place were to be understood of our fulfilling
the righteousness of the law in or by our selves, Christ had not obtained his
end* for so long as the flesh, that is, our inbred cotruption, by reason
whereof it is impossible for the law to justify, remains, as in this life it
always does, even in the best; so long it is not possible, either to fulfill
the law, or to be justified by the observation of it.

. XII. To the second place, which is the third petition of the Answ. To his
second and third testimonies. Mat. 6. 10.
Lords Prayer, I answer, that we pray not, that we upon earth may in equality
of obedience match the Angels in heaven: but that we may imitate their
obedience, and be like to them in doing the will of God, willingly, readily,
faithfully, constantly. For the particle, (...), as, signifies not parity but
likeness^. In the life to come we shall indeed be (...), Matthew. 22. 30. as the
Angels, but here we may not dream of Angelical perfection.

To the Heb. 5. 9.
third I answer, that our Savior is Author of salvation to all that obey
him: which is to be understood both of the obedience of faith, which is the
principal, for this is the Io^. 6. 29.
work of God, (by which in Christ we fulfill the law) that we believe in
Christ; and also of our new obedience. But neither of both does argue the
perfect fulfilling of the law in our own persons. This threefold cord
therefore is easily dissolved.

. XIII. His fifth reason, Whosoever have the holy Spirit, they fulfill His
fifth reason.
the Law.

All that are truly justified have the holy Spirit, Romans 5. 5. and 8. 15. 1
Cor. 3. 16. Gal. 3. 2. Tit. 3. 6.

Therefore all that are truly justified fulfill the Law.

The proposition he proves thus, Whosoever have the fruits of the Spirit,
Gal. 5. they fulfill the Law: All that have the Spirit have the fruits of the
Spirit: Therefore all that have the Spirit fulfill the Law.

This second proposition he proves, because against those who produce the
fruits of the Spirit, as charity, joy, peace, etc. There is no Law, that is,
the Law has not whereof to accuse them, as the breakers thereof. Therefore
whosoever is justified, by the help of the Spirit he fulfilleth the Law: and
if he do not fulfill the Law, then has he not received the Spirit, neither is
he truly justified.

To the proposition of the first syllogism, I answer, that those who have
received the Spirit do keep the Law. But none fulfill the Law, who have not
the fullness of the Spirit; and none have the fullness of the Spirit, in whom
the flesh remains lusting against the Spirit. In whom this conflict is, as it
is in the best, They cannot do the things that they would, Gal. 5. 17. And
much less can they fulfill the Law, from which they are so far, as that the
good things they would, they do not; and the evil things which they would
not, they do, Romans 7. 19.

And so to the proposition of the second syllogism, that those who have the
Spirit, have the fruits of the Spirit, but not without measure, nor in full
measure, but according to the measure of the gift of Christ, Ephesians. 4. 7.
Having received but the first fruits of the Spirit, Romans 8. 23.

As for his third prosyllogisme, that against such there is no Gal. 5. 23.
law, the meaning is not, that those which have the fruits of the Spirit do
never transgress the law, for in many Iam. 3. 2.
things we offend all: but the words are to be understood, either of the
fruits of the Spirit, that against such there is no law, but against the
contrary fruits of the flesh: or of the persons endued with the fruits of the
Spirit, and then the meaning is, either as 1 Timothy 1. 9. That the law is not
given to such: or as Gal. 5. 18. That those who are led by the Spirit, are not
under the law; that is, they are neither under the curse, not yet under the
terror and dominion of the law, as if they needed thereby to be forced to
obedience, but they are, as it were, a law unto themselves, willingly
performing obedience to that which the law prescribes, according to the
measure of grace received; not but that sometimes they fail, the flesh
prevailing against the Spirit. Not under the curse, nor subject to the
accusation and condemnation of the Law, because in Christ, who has freed them
from the curse, their sins are forgiven. Romans 8. 33, 34.
Who then shall lay any thing to the charge of Gods children, seeing it is God
that does justify, who shall condemn, seeing Christ who dyed for us, makes
also intercession for us. But this does not prove, that therefore the faithful
sin not. But this proves, that when having sinned they confess their
sins, God is just to forgive them, because we have an Advocate with the
Father; Christ Jesus the righteous, and he is the propitiation for our sins.
In this forgiveness of our sins, and Gods acceptance of us in Christ, and
not in our obedience does our justification consist. But he that fulfilleth the
Law needs not remission of sins, which all do need. And therefore
desperate is Bellarmines conclusion, that whosoever is justified fulfilleth the
Law; and whosoever does not fulfill the Law (which no man does) is not
justified.

. XIV. And such also is his last argument, which may thus be His sixth reason,
because the righteous sin not.
framed.

Whosoever sins not fulfilleth the Law.
Of every justified man it may be verified, that he sins not.
Therefore every justified man fulfilleth the Law.
The proposition he proves, because he that sins not, does not transgress
the Law: and he that does not transgress the Law, does fulfill it.

First, I answer to the proposition and the proof thereof: that they are
true, if understood of continued acts; as thus, he that sins not, that is,
that never sins: he that transgresses not the Law, that is, that never
does transgress it, does fulfill it. For none do fulfill the Law but they who
continue in all the things that are written in the Book of the Law to do
them, which is duly to be marked. For the Papists seem to be of this
opinion, that by any one act of obedience, wherein a man sins not, he does
fulfill the Law. And so they fear not to say, that every work of charity does
absolutely merit eternal life; wherein they do grievously err; imagining,
that as one act committed against charity does absolutely deserve damnation: so
any one act proceeding from charity does absolutely merit salvation. But who
knows not, that the whole law of God is copulative, and so to be understood.
As therefore in a copulative proposition consisting of many, suppose twenty
parts; if any one be false, though all the rest be true, the whole proposition
is false, and to be denied. So if a man should keep all the Commandments, and
transgress any one though it were but once, he is a transgressor of the law,
and is, as Iam. 2. 10.
Saint James says, guilty of all; and by the sentence of the law is subject to
the curse, because he has not Gal. 3. 10.
continued in all the things which are written in the Book of the law to do
them. He that would be thought to fulfill the law, must not only abstain
from all the things forbidden, but he must also do the things commanded, he
must do all, he must continue in doing all. And thus if the proposition and
the proof thereof be understood, he that sins not, he that transgresses
not the Law, that is, he that never sins, he that never transgresses the
Law does fulfill it, are true, but otherwise they are false and to be denied.

. XV. I come to the assumption, which Bellarmine proves thus. Whosoever is
regenerate and borne of God sins not.

All that are justified are regenerate; and that, because no man denyethit, he
proves by manifold testimonies, Ioh. 1. 12, 13. and 3. 5. 1 Pet. 2. 1 1 Ioh.
4. 7. Romans 8. 15. Therefore those that are justified sin not.

The proposition he proves out of 1 Ioh. 3. 9. Whosoever is borne of God
sins not, neither can he sin, because he is borne of God. Yet I will not
answer him as he answers us, De justif. 3. 3. c. 15.
viz. that there be five expositions of this place, and never a one of them to
the purpose, and so dismiss it, being indeed unanswerable: but I answer, that
the Apostle does not mean that the regenerate are (...), or do not sin at
all, for to that erroneous sense both Iouin. and Pelag. did abuse that place,
as Bellar. here does: but his meaning may be explained out of his own words in
the same Epistle, for as in the fifth chapter. v. 18. When he says,
whosoeveris borne of God sins not, he means, as appears by the words
going before, that he sins not unto death: that is commits not that
unpardonable sin, for which we are not to pray, v. 16. so here, when he says,
whosoever is borne of God does not commit sin, his meaning may be collected out
of the next verse going before verse. 8. compared with Ioh. 8. 34. he that is
borne of God works not sin, (...) for he that works sin, he that is a
worker of iniquity, is of the Devil, as he says verse. 8. He that works
sin, says our Savior, Ioh. 8. 34. is the servant of sin, and therefore in
him sin reigns. As therefore in the fifth chapter when he says, he that
is borne of God sins not, he means, that he does not so sin as he had
said verse. 16. viz. unto death: so here when it is said he cannot sin, his
meaning is in that manner, as a worker of iniquity, as the child of the Devil,
as the servant of sin, in whom sin reigns. And in this sense Augustine
Expos in G^l. c. 5.
says in quo peccatum non regnat, non peccat, in whom sin reigns not, he
sins not, namely as those who in the scriptures are called Ioh. 9. 31.
sinners, that is impenitent sinners, servants of sin, in whom sin
reigns, workers of iniquity, Luke 13. 27. Matthew. 7. 23. who shall be
condemned. But although they, who are borne of God are not such as the
Scripture calls sinners, neither do so sin as the servants of sin, in
whom sin reigns, yet they are penitent and believing sinners, in whom sin
remainteh, who often sin through humane frailty. There is no man that sins
not says Solomon, 1 King. 8. 46.
yea there is not a righteous man upon earth Eccl. 7. 20.
that does good and sins not; in many things we, says James the just, do
offend all. If we say that we have not sinned, or that we have no sin,
says the most holy Apostle Saint John 1 Ioh. 1. 8, 10.
we deceive our selves, we make him a liar, and there is no truth in us. And
therefore desperate again is Bellarmines assertion, that whosoever is
justified or regenerated, sins not, that is, never sins: and on the other
side, whosoever sins is not a man regenerate nor justified, which is to
exclude all men from Justification, and consequently from Salvation.

. XVI. And thus have I answered Bellarmines arguments concerning Our proofs
that the Law is not possible, were propounded before.
the possibility of the Law. Now it may be expected that I should propound and
mainetaine ours. But this task I have already performed in handling the third
question of this controversy concerning the matter of our justification, where
among many other arguments, proving that we are not justified by any
righteousness inherent in us, or performed by us, but only by the
righteousness of Christ which is out of us in him, we used this Lib. 4. cap. 5.
for one. By what righteousness we are justified, the Law is satisfied: By
Christ's righteousness alone the Law is satisfied, and not by that which is
inherent in us, or performed by us. And this assumption we prove, because we
are not able to sati fie the Law, neither in respect of the Commandment, it
being by reason of the flesh impossible unto us; nor in respect of the penalty,
which cannot be satisfied by us, but with endless torment. So that, as I said
before, all this discourse of the possibility of the Law is nothing but a
defense against a piece of one of our arguments.

Now I should follow him to the second point, which he propounded His
discourse concerning the perfection of (...) s, was before refuted, Lib. 4.
to prove that the works of the righteous are simply and absolutely just, and
after their manner, perfect: Which may also seem to be an answer to another
piece of our argument. For that righteousness by which we are justified is
perfect, such only is the righteousness of Christ which is out of us in him,
such is not that which is inherent in us as the habitual; or performed by us,
as the actual. Bellarmine therefore in opposition to that breach concerning
perfect actual righteousness, propounded the proof of this point. But that
our best righteousness is unperfect and stained with the flesh, I have fully
proved before, and have answered all the arguments which Bellarmine produces
here, in my fourth Lib. 4. c. 2.. 8. 9. and cap. 3. and 4.
Book, whereunto I refer the reader. Here only I signify again, that
Bellarmine falls very short in his proofs: for where he should prove, that
the works of the faithful are simply and absolutely just, and perfect: as he
propounded the question; he now seems to prove this, that the good works of
the righteous are truly good, which we deny not.

. XVII. Yes but you Protestants, will they say, do teach, that Whether the
best works of the faithful be sins.
the best works of the faithful are sins, etc. Ans. We do not say that
their good works, as namely their prayer or their alms, etc. are sins: but
that in them, they being otherwise good, there are some imperfections and
stains which are sins: in respect whereof the faithful man in doing that,
which is good, sins, according to that, Eccl. 7. 20. We do confess that
the duties which the faithful perform are good works, and so called in the
Scriptures, though not purely and perfectly good; but having their
imperfections, and being stained with the flesh. Even as we call a man
regenerated, a just or a good man, though he be not perfectly just, being
partly flesh and partly spirit. Thus a vessel wherein there is wax mixed with
honey before it be clarified, is truly called a vessel of honey, though not
sinceri mellis, of pure or sincere honey. A cup of wine wherein is a mixture of
some water with wine, is truly called a cup of wine though not vini meraci, of
pure wine. In like manner a wedge of gold, wherein there is some dross, is
truly called a wedge of gold, though not of pure gold. An heap of corn in
the floor wherein there is perhaps as much chafe as wheat, is truly called an
heap of wheat. A field, wherein are tares and other weeds, as well as corn,
is notwithstanding called a corn field, the denomination being taken from the
better part. Verily, whiles we live in this world, we are as gold wherein there
is much dross, and never are fully refined until we are to be translated
into the celestial house of God. Whiles we are in the Church militant, as it
were in Gods floor, we are mingled with much chafe, and are never perfectly
cleansed from the chafe of our corruptions, until we are to be translated
into the Lords Granaries. And such as we are, such also are our actions: such
as the tree is, such is the fruit. But if he will prove that men are justified
by their works, he must prove, not only that they are truly good, but also
purely and perfectly good: and not only, that some of their works are truly
and purely good, but that all their works are truly and perfectly, and not
that only, but also perpetually good. For if any of his works be sins, he
cannot be justified by his works. But this can never be proved. Neither does
he go about to prove that all the actions of justified men are good, but some
only, and these not purely, and perfectly, but truly good. To which purpose
he spends three whole De justif. l. 4. c. 15. 16. 17.
Chapters, which I have fully answered in my fourth Lib 4. c. 2. 3. 4.
Book.

CHAP. VIII. Whether good Works do justify. Bellarmines proof, but
especially that Testimony of Saint James, Chapter 2. fully discussed, and
clared.
. I.

AFter so many wanderings, Bellarmine at length comes to make good his fifth
Argument, De justif. lib. 4. c. 18.
which he propounded to prove, that faith alone does not justify, because good
works do also justify; though here, as I have noted, this Argument is
brought in to prove the truth of actual righteousness. The Title of this
Chapter is, that good works are not only just, but that also they do
justify. In stead whereof he presently propounds this assertion to be
proved, that by good works a just man is more justified, and made more just.
But this is not the Question. For we do confess, that a man already justified
before God, by the practice of good works increases in righteousness
inherent, and is made more holy and just. The thing which we deny is this, that
good works do not concur with faith unto the act of justification before
God, as any cause thereof. Against this assertion he ought to have disputed, if
he would seem to contradict us. But he has altered the question, because he
is not able to mainetaine the contradictory of our assertion; and makes the
question to be this, whether by good works men are justified, that is to say,
made more just, viz. in respect of righteousness inherent. But we deny, that
there are any degrees of justification, or that a man may be more justified, or
that justification does ever signify increase of righteousness: we reject
their new* found distinction of justification into the first and second, and
acknowledge no other justification, but that, which in the Scriptures and
Fathers is called the justification of a sinner: and thereby we understand a
continued act of God: who, as when we being sinners did first believe, did
justify us; so remaining sinners in our selves he does still justify us, by
imputation of Christ's righteousness, acquitting us from our sins, and
accepting of us as righteous in Christ. And this justification, which is only
acknowledged by the Scriptures and Fathers, is every where ascribed to faith.
Whereas the first justification of the Papists is ascribed to charity as the
only form; the second to works, as to the merit thereof. But all this
arises from their erroneous and wilful confounding of justification and
sanctification. For their first justification is that, which the Scriptures
call regeneration, and is the first act of Sanctification, by which we are
habitually sanctified, for they make it to be nothing else, but the infusion of
the habits of grace: Their second justification, is their actual
fanctification, or exercise of good works, whereby their inherent
righteousness or sanctification is increased. But the question is not of
sanctification, but of justification; which the Papists by their wicked
doctrine, confounding it with sanctification, have wholly abolished, it being
the maine benefit of the Messiah, by which we are both freed from hell, and
entitled to heaven. Neither is the question understood of justification before
men, but before God. For before men we do confess^ that by good works men are
justified, that is declared and known^ to be just, as by the fruits, effects,
consequents, and signs of justification by faith: but before God we are not
justified, that is, made or constituted just by work^s, as any cause thereof,
for good works go not before justification, but follow after, which is a
plain evidence that they are no cause of it.

. II. But let us examine his proofs; the first and principal is out The place
of Jam. 2. 14. etc. fully discussed and cleared.
of James 2. which being the only place of Scripture, whereupon with any show
of probability they ground their doctrine of justification by works: I will
not content my self to answer Bellarmines cavils alone: but I will endeavor
to stop the mouths of all the Papists, who use to vaunt of this place,
especially of the 24. verse; where they brag, that their assertion is
expressed, and ours confuted in plain terms: ye see then that a man is
justified by works, and not by says only. Which words are a consectary or
conclusion deduced from the example of Abraham: who though he were justified by
faith without works as Saint Paul teaches; yet was he also justified by
works and not by faith only, as Saint James affirms. A conclusion therefore
in show of words contradictory A seeming difference b^ tweene Saint Paul and
Saint James.
to that of the Apostle Paul, Romans 3. 28. we conclude, that a man is justified
by faith without the works of the Law, and Gal. 2. 16. we know, that a man is
not justified by the works of the Law* (...) that is, but only by faith:
which no doubt was the Apostles meaning. For as I have showed heretofore, if
this be a good disjunction, that we are justified either by faith, or by works;
(that is, either by the righteousness of Christ which is out of us in him
apprehended by faith or by the works of the Law, that is, by righteousness
inherent in our selves all which is prescribed in the Law) as undoubtedly it
is; for a third thing cannot be named, whereby we might be justified, and by
both we cannot; (for if by faith, then of grace; and if of grace, then not of
works, and contrary wise Romans 4. 4, 5. 11. 6.) then it follows necessarily,
that if we are not justified by works, we are justified by faith alone. Hence
arises this great controversy between the true Catholics and the Papists: we
affirming, that we are justified by faith without works, or by faith alone; The
Papists contending, that we are justified by works and not by faith only: we
alleging the authority of Saint Paul in his Epistles, to the ^omanes,
Galatians, Ephesians; the Papists this Testimony of Saint James.

. III. The way to determine this weighty Controversy is to reconcile the
seeming difference between the two Apostles. Some, How it may be reconciled. a
Erasm. Cajetan Musculus, etc.
a when they were not able to untye this Gordian knot, have sought, with
Alexander, to cut it, by questioning without just cause the authority of that
Epistle of Saint James. But the Papists and we are thus far agreed. First,
as they do not deny those Epistles of S. Paul, which were never questioned; so
we acknowledge this of Saint James, though it has been questioned, to be
canonical. Secondly, that the two Apostles, acted by the same Spirit of truth
in penning their Epistles, could not possibly deliver contrary assertions: and
consequently, that they only are to be esteemed to hold the truth, who fitly
reconciling the seeming variance between the two Apostles, do teach that
doctrine, which is agreeable to both. Here then I am to demonstrate, both
against the Papists, and for our selves: against the Papists three things.
First, that the doctrine which they ground upon this place of Saint James, is
contrary to that of Saint Paul. Secondly, that their exposition of Saint James
they make him contradict the Apostle Paul. Thirdly, that their doctrine cannot
be grounded upon this Text. For our selves two things. First, that by our
exposition the two Apostles are easily reconciled. Secondly, that the assertion
of the two Apostles, according to our doctrine, not only may well stand
together, but also of necessity must go together. For the first: we have the
same controversy with the Papists, as I have noted before, which the Apostle
maintained against the justiciaryes of his time. And their opposite doctrine to
Saint Paul, which they would gladly father upon Saint James, stands in those
six maine errors, which I have plainly and fully confuted in this treatise.
And namely in this particular; they affirming, that men are justified by
works, which the Apostle every were constantly denies. To the second, whiles
they understand the two Apostles to speak in the same sense, of faith, of
works, of justifying; as namely, that both speak of a true justifying faith;
of works, as causes of justification; of justifying, as making just by
righteousness inherent: they make the one directly to contradict the other.
For if Paul affirm, that men are justified by a true faith without works, and
James deny it: If Paul deny, that we are justified by works, as the causes of
justification, and James affirm it: If Paul deny, that we are made just
before God by works, and James affirm it; how do they not contradict one
another?

. IV. Bellarm. hops to salve the matter with his newfound distinction
Bellarmines reconciliation of Paul and James.
of the first and second justification: that Paul speaking of the
justification, wherein a man of a sinner is made just, excludes works done by
the strength of nature without faith and without grace: and that James speaking
of the second justification, wherein a just man is made more just, says, that
by the works of grace proceeding from faith a man is justified.

Answ. Such a distinction might be applied to sanctification, which is partly
habitual, the which they call their first justi^cation, consisting chiefly in
charity: and partly actual, which is their second justfication, consisting in
good works: but being applied to justification, it has no ground, either in
the Scriptures or in the ancient fathers. Neither can any such distinction
possibly be applied to that justification, which the Scriptures teach, as I
have showed Lib. 1. c. 1.. 8. and l. 2. c. 6.. 5.
heretofore. Secondly, if there could be such a distinction, I would say, that
Paul, when he denies Abraham to have been justified by works did speak of
the second justification, which Bellarmine himself confesses. For Abraham,
when he was said to be justified by faith without works, did abound which
works, as Bellarmine confesses, and yet was not justified by them. And that
James when he speaks of Rahab the harlot, whom he affirms to have been
justified by works, speaks of the first justification, as Bellarmine also
affirms. If therefore Paul say, that in the first justification none are
justified by works, and James affirm that some are, as namely Rahab: If the
Apostle James say, that Abraham in his second j^stification was justified by
works, and Paul do as planiely deny it, how are they reconciled? Again says
Bellarmine, Paul from justification only excludes the works done without
grace; James includes only the works of grace. I answer, that Paul
excludes from justification Abraham's works, which as else where Heb. 11. 8,
9, 17.
he testifies, he wrought by faith: And James includes the works of Rahab
the harlot, which was done, as Bellarmine says, without grace going before.
Where I desire the reader to observe what Bellarmine answeareth. As Paul, says
he, when he did speak of the first justification, brought the example of
Abraham, which was indeed of the second, that he might prove, as it were a
majori, from the greater, that a sinner cannot be justified by works done
without faith, if righteous Abraham was not made more just by his works done
without faith: even so James, when he did speak of the second justification,
brought the example of Rahab, which is of the first justification, that he
might prove a majori, (he should say a minori, if my logic fail me not)
from the less, that a just man is made more just by his works and not only
by faith, if Rahab of an harlot was made just by works and not only by faith.
Answ. Thus then he makes the Apostles to argue. If Abraham's works would not
have justified him without faith, much less would the good works of the
wicked. And if Rahab by her work of mercy was of an harlot made just: how
much more shall the good works of the righteous make them more just?
Bellarmines absurdities noted.


. V. Where by the way you may note diverse absurdities, which I have partly
touched before. First, that the Apostle forsooth brings Abraham as an example
of justification by works: when it is most evident, that he brings him as
an example of justification by imputation of righteousness without works, and
makes his example the exemplar or pattern of all others, who in like manner
are justified by faith without works, or by imputation of righteousness without
works.

Secondly, That Paul produces Abraham as an example to prove, that a just man
is more justified by his works; for which there is no color praeter
impudentiam asseverandi, the contrary is proved, that Paul speaking of the
justification of a sinner applies, what he says, to Abraham. For he proves
that Abraham was not justified by works, because the Scripture says, Romans 4.
4, 5.
Abraham believed God and it was imputed to him for righteousness. Now to him
that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt. But to him that
works not, but believes on him that justifies the ungodly (which was
Abraham's case) his faith is counted for righteousness.

Thirdly, the Apostle when he excludes Abraham's works from justification,
does not exclude his good and gracious works, but such as he did, or might
have done without grace, that is to say, graceless works. But no doubt the
Apostles intent in producing the example of Abraham, which Chrysostom also
has observed; was this: If Abraham who did abound with so many notable works,
which he wrought by faith, was not justified by them but only by faith: then
it is certain, that none are justified by works, though their works be never
so gracious.

Fourthly, He supposes, that gracious Abraham might have done good works
without grace, and that the Apostle denies him to have been justified by such
works, as he might have done, but did not.

Fifthly, By an impudent devise, whereof there is no color, he makes the
Apostle from the example of Abraham to argue a majori. If Abraham's works would
not have justified him, unless they had proceeded from faith: then much less
can the works of sinners and unregenerate men done without faith justify them.

Sixthly, He shamefally inverteth the Apostles question, and perverteth his
whole disputation; As if the Apostle disputed this question, whether works do
justify without faith (which he does never so much as mention;) and not,
whether faith does justify without works, which is indeed the question.

Seventhly, Where he says; that the Apostle excludes works only from their
imaginary first justification, which is merely habitual; he conceives, that
the Apostle took all these pains, to prove, that works are no part of
habitual righteousness.

Eighthly, Where he says, that the Apostle excludes from justification works
of nature and not of grace, it is as much as if he should have said, that the
Apostle does so seriously labor to prove, that men are not justified by such
works as are not good, but evil.

To conclude, it is evident, that the Apostle Paul excludes from the act of
justification all works in ge^all, whether done before grace or after; of all
men, whether unregenerate, or regenerate, even of Abraham himself. Yea more
specially the works of the faithful and regenerate. First, Because he
speaks of good works, even the works of righteousness which we (the
faithful) have done Tit. 3. 5. Secondly, The question being, whether faith
does justify without works, or whether faith and works together; the Apostle
must be understood to exclude those works from the act of justification, which
with faith concur in the party justified. Even as Abraham, though his faith
was accompanied with store of good works yet he was justified, and so are all
the faithful, by faith without works.

If therefore St. James do affirm, that men are justified in the same sense
that Paul denies the same; and that Abraham was justified by his works, which
Paul denies; he is made to contradict the Apostle Paul.

. VI. But as the Popish doctrine is repugnant to the doctrine of the Apostle
Paul, so neither can it be grounded upon this text, The Popish doctrine not
grounded on Iam. 2.
which may appear by a brief Analysis thereof. Where first, you are to
consider the occasion of this discourse, and thereupon the scope of the Apostle
therein. The occasion was the dissolute life of many The Analysis of that
passage beginning at the foureteenth verse.
Christians, who, as Jude speaks verse. 4. did turn the grace of God into
wantonness, vain men, as St. James calls them verse. 20. who, when they had
learned, that a man is justified by faith without works, hereby took occasion
to cast of all care of good works. As if it were sufficient for them howsoever
they lived, to profess them selves to believe.

The scope therefore and intendement of the Apostle is, not to confute the
doctrine of Paul concerning justification by faith alone, but according to
Paul's direction Tit. 3. 8. to persuade all those, who profess themselves to
believe, to be studious of good works. And that he does by this argument:
because, howsoever faith does justify alone, yet the profession of faith alone
without good works will not justify nor save a man; but is altogether vain
and unprofitable. The (...) or state of the question, which he propounds to
argue, manifestly appears by the proposition, wherein the question is
propounded, and by the conclusion wherein the question is concluded, the
proposition, verse. 14. What profit my brethren, if a man say he has faith,
and has not works, will (...) that faith save him? Mark the words: if a man
shall say, he has faith, that is, if a man shall profess himself to believe,
and has not works, that is a conversation answerable in some measure to his
profession; will that faith, which is in profession only justify or save him?
this interrogation implies a most Emphaticall negation: wherein he does not
only deny that faith, which is only in profession, and does not work by
love, does justify or save a man; but also, for the truth of his denial, he
does appeal, as it were, to their conscience; sor so much is meant by the
interrogation. The question then is not, whether true faith do justify alone,
as Bellarmine would have it; but whether that faith, which is alone, and by it
self; verse. 17. without works, without a Christian conversation, be a true
justifying or saving says. This the Apostle denies, and so do we. In the
rest of the discourse he proves this negative assertion by an argument from
the contrary, namely that this fruitless faith is not a true faith, because it
is dead. Where the Apostle argues to this effect: That faith, which is dead,
does not justify or save a man: The faith which is profession only, and is
alone without works is dead. Therefore that faith which is in profession
only, and is alone without works, does not justify or save a man.

The assumption he proves in this whole discourse, where the con^lusion is
always this, that the faith which is alone and without works is dead, and
therefore that is the question which is disputed and concluded.

. VII. Now that the faith which is alone and without works That the faith
which is with out works is dead, proved by five arguments.
is dead, he proves by five arguments.

1. The first a part: That charity which is only in word and not in deed is
vain and unprofitable verse. 15. 16. Even so pariratione, that faith which is
in profession only having no works to accompany it, is dead, verse. 17.

2. The second argument is taken from the effects. For a true lively faith may
be demonstrated by good works: and that which cannot be demonstrated by good
works, is but a dead faith. And this he proves verse. 18. against the carnal
Gospeller, as it were, by the parties own testimony, or forced confession,
provoking him to make experience, which kind of proof is called (...). Thou
professest the faith having no works: I also profess the faith and have
works, come now to the trial, he that has a true faith may approve it by
the fruits: show then they faith, if thou can, by thy works (which thou
know thou can not do) and I by my works will approve my faith.

3. The third argument is from the subject. For a true justifying faith is not
common to all men. 2. These. 3. 2. and much less to Devils, but is proper to
the Elect, Tit. 1. 1. But that faith, which men profess without charity and
without good works is common to Devils. verse. 19. Thou professest, that thou
believe that there is one God, thou do well: but if this thy belief be
not accompanied with charity and good works; know this, that the devils
themselves who hate God, do, though with horror, know and perforce believe
the same.

4. The fourth argument to prove, that faith only professed, or which is in
profession only, is not a true and a lively, but a conterfeit and a dead
faith; is a twofold example, of Abraham, and of Rahab, who were justified, that
is, declared and known to be just by their works. For in this sense, as the
word is often used in the Scriptures as M^t. 11. 19. Luk 7. 29. R^. 3. 4. 1.
Tim. 3. 16: so of necessity it must be taken in this place. For by good
works, which always follow, and never go before justification, we are not
made just: but being already justified, we are by them declared and known to
be just. For he is a righteous 1 John 3. 7.
man that works righteousness. And this the Schoolmen themselves do teach,
that works do^ justifi^ ^clarative Th^s Aquinas says, Jn Gal 3. lect. 4.
Opera n^n sunt ca^sa quod aliqui^ sit i^tus apud Deum, etc. works are not the
cause why any man is just before God, but rather they are the executions and
manifestations of justice. Nam nullus per opera iustificatur apud Deum sed per
habitum fidei. For no man is justified before God by works, but by the habit
of faith. And whereas it might be objected out of Iam. 2. that Abraham was
justified by works: he answeareth, Ibid.
the word to be justified many be taken two ways: whereof the one is, quantum
ad executionem iustitiae, and manifestationem inrespect of execution and
manifestation of justice, and hoc m^do iustificatur homo, i. iustus ostenditur
ex operib. operatis, and thus a man is justified, that is declared be just by
the works which he has done. And thus the ordinary gloss expounds the
word in this place. But let us come to the words. verse. 20.

. VIII. But will thou know O vain man, that faith, that is, Verse 20.
expounded.
that faith professed or in profession only without works is dead, or that
the faith which is without works is known to be dead. For the life of faith
it self does not depend upon works as the cause, but is thereby known as by
the effects. You see again what the question is which he will conclude:
namely that the faith which is without works, or which is in profession only
without works, is not a lively but a dead faith, and consequently not a
justifying faith. For a justifying faith is like the faith of Abraham and of
Rahab: but that faith which is in profession only and wants works is not
like the faith of Abraham and of Raba^. For though Abraham was justified by
faith without works as the Apostle Paul proves, yea by faith alone as the
Papists themselves confess; yet the faith by which he was justified was not
alone, but was fruitful of good works, by which both he and his faith were
justified, that is known to be just and upright.

. IX. Verse. 21. was not Abraham our Father, says he, justified The example of
Abraham, Verse 21.
by works, when he had offered his son Isaac upon the Altar? Of which
words the meaning is not, that Abraham by that work was justified before God,
or made just, for long before, the holy Ghost gave him this testimony Genesis 15.
Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: not, that
then he first believed, or was then first justified: for when he first left
his country, which he left by faith Heb. 11. 8. he had believed, and his
faith no doubt was imputed to him for righteousness: but that by that special
work after he was proved, he was approved and known to be a righteous man.
For upon Abraham's approbation of his faith and obedience, when he was tried,
the Lord gave him this testimony, Genesis 22. 12. Now I know, that thou fear
God etc. Did not God know it before? Yea no doubt, but he speaks after the
manner of men. He had tempted Abraham, that is, by a commandment of trial he
had proved his faith and obedience; not that he did not know, but that he
would make it known to Abraham and others. As on the contray, God is said 2.
Chron. 32. 31. to have left Ezechias to try him, that he might know, that is,
that he might make known all that was in his heart, when as therefore Abraham
being tried, had by that act of offering his son approved his faith and
obedience, the Lord says, Now I know, that is, now by this trial it is made
known, that thou art a just man and one that fears God. And in this sense,
as it is most manifest, he is said by his works to have been justified, that
is, known, declared, approved to be a just man.

. X. Hereupon St. James infers verse. 22. Do you not see, Verse 22.
how faith did cooperate to or with his works? The verb (...) may be
understood two ways, either that faith with other graces did cooperate to the
bringing forth of this work, as namely with the fear of God, and love of God,
Genesis 22. 12. though faith was the principal, Heb. 11. 17. Or else, that faith
did cooperate with his works, not to justify him before God, but to
manifest, declare and approve his righteousness. In which sense we must
understand the word Faith, as in the proposition ( verse. 24.) for faith
professed: or the profession of faith which does concur together with works
to make a man, truly justified, to be known. And in this sense faith does
cooperate with works, and may be said to justify by declaring a man to be
just, though Bellarmine holds the contrary. For that a man may be
acknowledged to be a man truly justified before God by faith, two things must
concur; the profession of the true faith, and a Christian conversation,
neither of which alone is sufficient.

It follows in the same verse: and by works was faith made perfect. Which
words says Bellarmine cannot signify any other, but that his righteousness,
which was begun by faith, was perfected by good works. Answ. But James does
not say, that his righteousness, but his faith was perfected, and whereas he
says the words cannot signify otherwise, I say they may be understood two
other ways. First, that faith by works is perfected, because by works it is
manifested, and perfectly known, in which sense Gods strength is perfected in
our weakness 2. Cor. 12. 9. Secondly, because works bring the fruits and
effects of faith to be perfected, when it brings forth good fruits according
to his kind. For when any thing has attained to the end (as it has when it
does effectually produce those uses or fruits, for which it was ordained) it is
said (...) to be perfect. Now the end of our justification by faith is our
sanctification. For when faith was wrought in us (that is to say, in our
regeneration) we were the workmanship of God created unto good works, which
God has preordayned that we should walk in them. Ephesians. 2. 10. Faith therefore
may then be said to be perfected, when it does effectually bring forth the
fruit of good works: whereby a man is not made, but declared to be just.

. XI. Verse. 23. And this appears yet more plainly by that which follows.
And the Scripture was fulfilled, which says, Abraham believed God, and it was
imputed to him for righteousness. This Scripture was fulfilled Genesis 15. 6.
above 30. years before his offering of Isaake: and here again it is said to
have been fulfilled in this act, that is, the truth of that testimony, which
was given him so long before was then manifested, when by this work he
evidently declared, that he was endued with a true lively justifying faith.
And to the like purpose the same sentence might, as Bellarmine confesses, be
applied to Abraham in respect of any other notable fruit of his faith: that
then also that sentence was verified, Abraham believed God etc. For then it was
declared and manifested, that he was endued with a true justifying faith. As
for that conceit of Bellarmine, that if the Hebrew word be well scanned, it
will appear, that the meaning of the words is, that Abraham's believing God was
a ^ust work, it is but a poor shift. For Paul understands it of Abraham's
person, and makes that text his principal ground of the justification of the
faithful by imputation of righteousness without works. And James likewise
understands it of Abraham's person: showing that by this act of offering his
son the truth of that testimony was manifested, that he was endued with a
true faith, by which he was justified.

It follows in the same verse, and he was called the friend of God. 2.
Chron. 20. 7. Esai. 41. 8. that is, by this act he approved himself to be
such a one.

. XII. Hereupon Saint James, Verse 24. infers this consectary Verse 24.
or conclusion: you see then by this example of Abraham, that a man who is
justified before God by faith alone, as Abraham was, and that by imputation of
righteousness without works; is also justified by works, as Abraham was,
that is, by them, as by fruits and effects he is declared and approved to be
just, and not by faith professed only. He does not say, a man is justified by
works as causes, but as the effects. For that, and not the other is deduced
from the example of Abraham.

. XIII. The other example is of Rahab, Verse 25. For though Verse 25. The
example of Rahab.
you may think, that you need not compare with Abraham, and yet have a true
justifying faith; yet you will be ashamed to be behind Rahab the harlot; who
was no sooner justified before God by faith, but she was also justified, that
is, declared and known to be just by her work of charity toward the Espyes,
which she wrought by faith, Heb. 11. 31.

Concerning this example of Rahab, Bellarmine has four Assertions: of which
never an one agrees with another. First, That Rahab was not declared to be
just, because she was an harlot: which is false. For though she had been an
harlot, yet now she believed, and by her faith was justified before God, and by
her work which she wrought by faith, was justified, as Saint James says,
that is, declared to be just. Secondly, That James bri^geth the example of
Rahab to prove, that by good works a righteous person is made more righteous:
which also is false, and contrary to his former Assertion. Thirdly, That by
this work of mercy she was truly justified, and of a sinner made just. But
Rahab, as Bellar^ine says, was an example of the first justification; and
therefore of a sinner not made just by her work, but by the habit of grace
infused. The truth is, by faith she was justified before God, and by her
work she was declared to be just before men. Fourthly, That by that work,
as a disposition, she was prepared unto justifica^ion. Which agrees neither
with his third, where he said, that by this work she was truly justified,
and of a sinner made just, nor with Saint ^mes, whose meaning plainly is, not
that she was prepared unto justification by this work, no more than Abraham
was by his; but that she was declared by this work, as a fruit of her faith
and a consequent of her justification, as Abraham was by his works to be
justified before God. And thus much of the two examples.

. XIV. There rema^eth his fifth Argument, which is a similitude, The fifth
argument ^ simil^. verse 26.
Verse 26. For as the body without the Spirit is dead, so faith without works,
or that faith which is without works is dead, which words also may be two
ways expounded. For either the Apostle James speaks of the habit of faith,
or of the profession of it. If of the habit, then the comparison stands thus:
As the body of man without the Spirit, that is, without breath (which is the
prime signification of the word (...) derived from (...) to breathe, in which
sense it is called the spirit of the mouth, and spirit of the nostrils) I say,
as the body without breath is dead: so that says, which is without works,
which are as it were the breathing of a lively faith, is judged to be dead. For
as De resurrect. serm^ ^.
Bern^rd also says, As we discern the life of this body by its motion, so the
life of faith by works. If therefore faith it self be here meant, we must by
Spirit understand breath and not the soul. For although the Papists absurdly
make charity, which is a fruit of faith, 1 Timothy 1. 5. to be the form of it;
yet me thinks they cannot be so absurd, as to compare faith to the body, and
works to the soul: as though works, which are the fruits and effects both
of faith and of charity, were the form, and as it were, the soul of faith.

If by faith we understand faith professed or the profession of faith, as in
this discouse hitherto it has been used, and as it is used elsewhere, as Act.
14. 22. R^m. 1. 8. then you may understand the simili^de thus: As the body of
man without the Spirit, that is, the ^oule is dead: so the profession of faith
without a godly life, which is as it were the life and ^oule of our profe^on,
is also dead. For hypocrites whose life is not conformable to their profession,
though they have a ^ame, that they live, yet they are dead. Ap^c. 3. 1.

Thus by five arguments Saint I^mes has proved, that the faith, which is
alone, and without works, is not a true and a lively, but a dead and
counterfeit faith, and yet (...), both here and Lib. 1. d^ justif. cap. 15.
will needs have Saint ^ames to speak of a true faith, as if he supposed, that
a true faith might be without works.

Therefore the Popish Doctrine of justification by works as causes thereof
cannot be grounded on this T^xt of Saint James.

. XV. Yea, but will some say, the contradiction is not yet salved. Object.
Concerning the contradiction, of faith only, and not only.
For Saint Paul affirms, as you say, that faith alone does justify, and Saint
James in plain terms denies, that a man is justified by faith only. I
answer, when we say, that faith only does justify, we do not mean
absolutely, that nothing does justify but faith in no sense whatsoever. For
many things may truly be said to justify ali^ atque ali^ sensu, in diverse
senses, as I have showed heretofore. God the Father as the prime efficient,
Christ as the meritorious cause, God as the Judge, Christ, as the Advocate.
God, as the Creditour, Christ, as the Surety. The grace of God as the moving
cause, the righteousness of Christ as the matter, the imputation thereof as the
form, the holy Ghost as the applying cause, the Word and Sacraments as the
instruments of the holy Ghost, Faith as the hand of the receiver, works as
testimonies and signs, etc. but our meaning is, that we are justified by the
righteousness of Christ only, which is apprehended by faith alone, and that
in us nothing does concur to the act of justification, but faith alone, it
being the only instrument whereby we receive Christ.

And thus have you heard what is to be alleged against the Papists. First,
that their doctrine concerning justification by works which they would build
upon this Text, is repugnant to the Scriptures. Secondly, that by their
exposition they make Saint I^mes to contradict Saint Paul. Thirdly, that their
doctrine cannot be grounded on this Text.

. XVI. Now for our selves, I will show, that by our exposition Our
reconciliation of the two Apostles.
the seeming difference between the two Apostles is manifestly reconciled: and
that by our Doctrine their Assertions, not only may First, from the diversity
of the Partie^ with whom they dealt.
well stand together, but also must necessarily go together. The
reconciliation is easily made, if we consider two things, first, the diversity
of the Parties, with whom the two Apostles had to deal. For the Apostle Paul
having to deal with Pharisaicall Iustitiaries, who sought to be justified by
a righteousness inherent in themselves, and by an obedience performed by
themselves, proves by invincible arguments, that a man is justified by faith
without works. Saint James having to deal with carnal Gospellers, vain men,
turning the grace of God into wantonness, who having heard, that faith does
justify without works, did cast off all care of good works, thinking it
sufficient to profess themselves to believe, though their life were dissolute.
Against these Saint James proves, that vain is the profession of faith
without good works ^ that the faith, which is without works, is not a true,
lively justifying faith, but a dead and counterfeit faith: that whosoever is
justified before God by faith, must also be justified, that is, declared and
approved to be just, not only by profession of his faith, but also by the
practice of good works. Wherefore in this respect there is no more difference
between the two Apostles Paul and James, than between L^ther, and us, who are
Preachers of the Gospel at this day. For as Luther having to deal with Popish
justitia^ies who taught justification by works, urges most zelously
justification by faith alone, and in the question of justification, after the
example of Saint Paul, speaks contemptuously of works: so we, having to d^le
with Libertines and carnal gospellers, insisting in the steps of Saint
James, urge the necessity of good works.

. XVII. Secondly, we are to consider the diverse acceptions of Secondly, from
the diverse acceptions of the words, faith, justify, woe kes.
the words, faith works justify, in the writings of the two Apostles. Paul
speaking of a true lively faith, which works by love, says (in effect) that
faith alone does justify. James, speaking of the faith of hypocrites, which is
in profession only, s^vered from the grace of sanctification, and destitute of
good works; ^aith, that such a faith does neither justify alone nor at all,
as being not a true, but a dead and counterfeit faith.

Paul, speaking of the c^uses of justification before God, denies works to
concur to the act of justification, as any cause thereof* James speaking of
the effects and ^ignes of justificati^n, whereby it may be^ known, affirms,
that works must concur in the parties justified, that by them our faith may
be demonstrated, and our justification manifested. Paul therefore rejects
works obtruded, as causes of justification; James urges them, as effects and
signs thereof.

Paul, speaking of Justification in the proper sense, as it signifies that
gracio^s action of God, whereby we are made or constituted just; affirms,
that we are justified by faith without works. James, speaking of that
justific^tion, whereby we are (not m^de just before God, but) declared and
(...), to God, our (...), and our conscience to be just, and endued with a
true faith; (...), that we are so justified, not only by the profession of
faith, but also by good works.

Now these (...) (...) very well stand together. For although it be most true,
which Saint Paul affirms, that true faith does just fie alone: yet it is
(...) true, which Saint James faith, that the faith, which is alone, does not
justify neither ^lone nor at all, because it is not (...) true and a lively,
but a (...), and dead faith. For (...) the living eye, though it see alone, yet
is not alone, so a lively faith, though it justify alone, yet never i^ alone,
though it justify without works, yet it is not without work^s. Though good
works do not (...) to the act of justification, a^ any cause ther^of,
according to Saint Paul's doctrine: yet they must concur in the same subject,
that is the party justified, as necessary fruit^ and (...) of ^ true justifying
^aith, (...) Saint Ia^es ^cheth. Though we be justified before God, that is,
both absolved from our (...), and accepted in Christ as righteous by faith
alone without respect of work^ as Saint Paul teaches: yet, according to the
doctrine of ^aint James, we^ are to be justified, that is, declared and
approved to be just not only by faith professed, but also by good works.
Finally, though good works n^n (...) (...), yet, (...) justifica^, as
Augustin^ uses to speak, or as he also says, non pr^edunt iustifi^andum, sed
justificat^ (...), though they do not go^ before justification, as caus^s,
(...) P^l teaches; yet they must follow in the parties justified, as effects,
according to Saint James his doctrine.

. XVIII. But the assertions of the 2. Apostles not only may well stand By our
doctrine the ^ssertions of the two Apostles must go together.
together; but also according to our doctrine they must necessarily go
together. For if we shall be altogether conversant in setting forth the
commendation of good works, and in urging the necessity thereof, not informing
the people in the doctrine of justification by faith alone: they will be ready
to place the matter of their justification, and the merit of their salvation in
themselves, as the Papists do. And so being ignorant of Gods R^* 10. 3.
righteousness, and seeking to establish their own righteousness, they do
not submit themselves to the righteousness of God. But we must so urge the
necessity of good works in the doctrine of sanctification, that we remember,
that in the question of justification they are of no value. On the other side,
if we shall be wholly taken up in the doctrine of justification by faith
alone, teaching, that in the question of justification they are of no worth,
and do not withal inform the people of the profit and necessity of good
works in other respects; how ready will they be to cast off all care of good
works, and content themselves with a bare profession of faith? But we join
these assertions together, after the doctrine and practice of the Apostles in
their Romans 6. 1, etc. ^ph. 2. 8, 9, 10. Tit. 3. 8.
Epistles. We teach that justification and sanctification are unseparable
companions. And theresore, as they who are sanctified, may be assured of their
justification; so without sanctification none can be 1 Ioh. 1. 7, 9. and 2, 1,
2, 3, 4.
assured of their justification. It is true, that there is no condemnation to
them that are in Christ Jesus, but who are they? that live not after the flesh,
but after the Spirit, R^. 8. 1. that are new creatures 2 Cor. 5. 17. that
crucify the flesh with the lusts thereof, Gal. 5. 24. It is true, that a true
lively faith does justify alone, but what manner of says is that? that
purifieth the heart, Act. 15. 9. and works by love, Gal. 5. 6. and may be
demonstrated by good works. Iam. 2. 18. It is true, that we are not justified
by our works, nor saved for them, yet those are neither justified, nor saved,
that are without them, for as they are necessary consequents of justification,
so they are necessary antecedents of salvation. For though they be not the
cause of our salvation; yet they are the way by which we are to come to
salvation: though they be not causa reg^andi, as Bernard says, yet they are
via regni. Though they be not the merit of salvation; yet they are the
evidence, according to which God will judge us. By faith we have our
inheritance, and our title to Gods Kingdom, but it is to be inherited among
those that are Act. 26. 1^. and 20. 32.
sanctified. A godly conversation, though it be not properly a cause of our
glorification; yet it is causa si^e q^ n^n. For as the Apostle says, without
holiness no man shall see God. Heb. 12. 14. And for this cause we seriously
exh^rtall men, who profess themselves to believe, and to be justified by
faith, to be careful, that they may be Tit. 3. ^.
precedents of good works, for these are good, and profitable, and necessary,
as I showed before, Six other testimonic^ ^lleaged by Bell^rmine.
when I propounded those arguments which we do use to move men unto good
works. So much of his first testimony.

. XIX. To that place of Saint James he adds De justif. l. 4. c. 19.
six other testimonies, to which a short answer will suffice. To the first out
of Eccles. 18. 21: I have fully answered in the first Lib. 2. cap. 4.. 2. and 3.
controversy.

2. His second testimony is Romans 6. 19. As you have exhibited your members to
serve uncleanness^ and iniquity unto iniquity: so now exhibit Testimon. 2. Romans
6. 19.
your members to serve justice unto sanctification. Where, unto sanctification,
does not signify to get the first holiness, sor he speaks to them who were
holy and just, but to increase sanctification. But that by sanctification is
meant justification: and by sanctity, justice, it is plain by the antithesis,
for he opposes sanctification to iniquity. His argument is thus framed:
Sanctification may and must be increased by good works, which is proved by
this text, and not denied by us.

Justification is sanctification. And that he proves, because what is opposed
to iniquity is justification: sanctification is here opposed to iniquity.
Therefore here sanctification signifies justification. Ans. That justification
and sanctification are by no means to be confounded. I proved at large in the
first Lib. 2.
question, for this is the source of all their errors in the doctrine of
justification. The Apostle does carefully distinguish them. For having in the
former chapters treated of justification by faith without works; that men
should not abuse that doctrine to licentiousness of life; in this, and the
next chapter, he treats of sanctification showing in this Romans 6
chapter that sanctification is a necessary companion of justification. And
therefore exhorts those that are justifi^ to the duties of sanctification.
The abuse he preventeth verse. 1. and 15. for whereas he had taught in the
doctrine of justification, that where sin abounded grace did superabound; he
makes this objection, what then? shall we continue in sin that grace may
abound? God forbid! So again, by Justification we are freed from the curse of
the Law, and from the rigor and terror or dominion it? what then? shall we
sin, because we are not under the Law, but under Grace? God forbid!

The unseparable conjunction of these two benefits is showed by the Romans 6. 3,
4, etc.
Sacrament of Baptism for as it is a seal of that righteousness, which is by
faith, unto us being baptized into the remission of sins: so it is the laver of
regeneration, wherein, as the Apostle says, we are baptized into Christ's death
and resurrection; that as he dyed, so we should dye unto sin: and as he rose
again never to dye any more: so we should arise from the grave of sin never
to dye any more: for how should they that are dead to sin live any more
therein? And hereupon follows his exhortation, that we should not let sin
reign in us, nor give our members as instruments of unrighteousnes unto sin,
etc. And as he does dehort us from suffering sin to relgne in us: so he
assures the faithful, that sin shall no more have dominion over them,
because they are not under the Law but under grace, and having prevented the
abuse of that doctrine, verse. 15. he renews both his dehortation from
suffering sin to reign in them, because if it did reign in them, they must
needs be the servants of it: when as in their redemption they were freed from
the bondage of sin, that they might become the servants Verse. 18.
of righteousness; and also his exhortation verse. 19. that they would yield
their members, as servants to holiness, etc.

To his reason, that by sanctification here is meant justification, because it
is opposed to iniquity: I answer, that both justification and sanctification
are opposed to sin and iniquity; but with this difference. In sin there are
two things, the guilt, and the corruption or pollution. By justification, which
is opposed to accusing and condemning Romans 8. 33. we are freed from the guilt
of sin and damnation: by our sanctification, which is opposed to pollution, we
are freed in some measure from the corruption, that it is to say, from the
dominion of sin.

. XX. His third testimony is 2 Cor. 7. 1. where the Apostle exhorts His third
tes^imony, 2 Cor 7. 1.
that having these promises (of our justification and adoption, chap. 6. 16,
28) we should cleanse our selves from all pollution of the flesh and spirit,
perfecting or accomplishing our sanctification in the fear of God. The Apostle
does not exhort us unto justification, (for that is never done in all the
Scriptures) but being justified and adopted, we are exhorted with our
justification and adoption to join the duties of sanctification, and therein
to grow and increase, until we come to a perfect man in Christ.

. XXI. His fourth testimony, 2 Cor. 9. 10. he will multiply your His fourth
tes^mony, 2 Cor. 9. 10
seed and will augment the increases of the fruits of our justice. Where we are
taught says he, that by alm^s-giving our wealth is diminished, but our j^stice
is increased. Answ. We answer, that by the Christian practice of virtues our
justice, (but not our justification) is increased. Howbeit, the Apostle does
not speak of justice it self to be increased, but of the fruits of justice;
by justice in this place meaning, as verse. 9. and Matthew. 6. 1. liberality in
almes-giving: and by the fruits of righteousness, alms. Unto which, that
they might be more and more enabled, the Apostle prays, that their seed may
be multiplied, meaning thereby their store (which in the faithful is as it
were the seed of alms) that having always all sufficiency in all things, they
might abound to every good work, being enriched in every thing to all
bountifulness, ve^s. 8, 11. so far is the Apostle from signifying that by
their almesgiving their wealth should be diminished

. XXII. His fifth testimony, Ioh. 14. 23. If any love me, he will His fif^h
^estimony, Ioh. 14. 23
keep my word, and my Father will love him. This new living after the
fulfilling of the Commandments, what is it, sath he, but the increase of love,
and thereby of righteousness, which by observing the Law of God is required.
Answ. We confess, that by the observance of the Law of God, our love of God
is exercised and our righteousness increased, though it be not proved out of
this place. For this love, after the keeping of Christ's word here mentioned, is
Gods love to us, not ours to him. His sixth testimony, Apoc. 22. 11.


. XXIII. His sixth testimony is Apoc. 22. 11. he that is just, let him be
justified yet. Answ. The word yet or still does not signify increase but
continuance: or if increase were meant, it could not be understood of the
righteousness of justification but of sanctification. But to this allegation I
have answered twice before. Lib. 2. cap. 4.. 5. and cap. 5. 10.


To conclude, in these six places we have seen scarce any color of proof
either of justification by works, or of increase of justification; and yet
these, besides Iam. 2. are all the testimonies which he has alleged out of
the Scriptures: which being compared with those plentiful and pregnant
Testimonies that plainly deny justification by works, do manifestly show the
cause of the Papists to be most desperate.

But it may be you will say, that although the Scriptures fail him, yet he
has store of testimonies of the Fathers, and plenty of reasons. Out of the
Fathers, he produces not one testimony: Neither does he give any reason, but
such as have been already confuted.

. XXIV. To these testimonies, says he, two reasons may be added out of
Bellarmines two Reasons.
those things, which have been proved in the former Chapters concerning the
possibility of the Law, and the truth of actual righteousness: for, says he,
if a just man can fulfill the Law, as before it has been demonstrated, then
^ay he also without doubt be justified by works. Again, If a just man can
perform works truly good, which are polluted with no vice, as we have showed
before, then he may work righteousness, and consequently may by multiplying
of just works increase his justice. Answ. He should say his justification. But
in both he disputes a posse ad esse: it is possible for a man to fulfill the
Law and consequently to be justified by works it is possible, that a righteous
man may perform some works truly and purely good by multiplying whereof he
may increase his justice. But the question is not, whether some choice man one
of a million, can fulfill the Law, and bring forth works purely good; but
whether every one that is justified does fulfill the Law, that is, does
continue in all the things which are written in the Book of the Law to do
them. Whether the works, yea all the works of every one, that is justified,
be purely good. For if he should transgress in any one particular, though it
were but by omission, he has not fulfilled the Law. If any of his works were
not truly and purely good, or if all his works be not pure, then he cannot
be justified by works. But he is so far from proving these things as it were
the esse, that he is not able to prove the posse, that any one mortal man is
able to fulfill the Law; or that any one action of any one regenerate man is
purely and perfectly good. The contraries of both which I have plentifully
proved before.

A TREATISE OF JUSTIFICATION.
THE EIGHTH BOOK: Concerning the Merit of good Works.
CHAP. I. Setting down the state of the Controversy, and propounding our
arguments against the merit of good Works.
. I. This controversy in a manner the same with that of the necessity of
efficiencie.


THere remains the last, though not the least error of the Papists in this
controversy, which is concerning the efficacy of good works. For the Papists
not contented to affirm, that good works do justify; do also teach that at
the hands of God they do merit or deserve the reward of eternal life. And
this, in effect, is the same with that, which Bellarmine labored to prove,
when he disputed of the necessity of good works unto salvation, not only
necessitate praesentiae, as the way to Gods kingdom, which we confess; but
also necessitate efficientiae, as causes thereof. For by the Efficiencie which
they ascribe to works, they mean no other but moral, which is, as they say,
by way of meriting. Howbeit the former assertion of the necessity of
efficiencie seems to contain a further degree of damnable error; viz. that
not only good works do merit or deserve salvation; but also, that none can
be saved without their own merits: for so much is employed in the term of the
necessity of efficiencie. The state of the controversy.


. II. But first we are to set down the state of the controversy, in setting
down whereof the Papists are very sparing, because in this point they differ
much among themselves. But yet in this they do agree, Council. Trident sess. 6.
cap. 16 and can. 32.
that all the good works of the regenerate are truly meritorious of eternal
life. Now for the explacation of the terms: by good works, which they say are
meritorious, they mean all such works, as are qualified according to those
seven conditions, which De justif. l. 5. c. 10.
Bellarmine requires. First, that they be material^y good, or good in their
kind. Secondly, that they be done in obedience to God. Thirdly, by such as are
viatores wayfaring men in this life. Fourthly, that they be free, that is, as
they expound it, voluntary, proceeding from their freewill. Fifthly, persormed
by men who are in the state of grace. Sixthly, having the promise of eternal
reward. Seventhly, proceeding from the virtue of Charity.

Secondly, by all such works they do not only mean all jointly, Quolibet
actu charitate informa^o homo beatitudinem meretur. Th. 1.* q. 62. art. 5. c.
but every one in particular: affirming, omne opus bonum that every good work
proceeding from Charity is meritorious of eternal life. Thirdly, by truly
meritorious, the word used by the Council of Trent, we understand, that which
properly and absolutely and for it self de^erveth the reward: thereby
excluding first, merita ex congruo, merits of congruity, which indeed do not
deserve, and therefore are not very nominis merita, truly and properly merits.
Notwithstanding Bellarmine and others retain the name, giving it chiefly to
those dispositions and preparations going before justification, according to
which grace is given: wherein they have rewarded the old assertion of Pelagius,
gratiam secundum merita dari. For if those dispositions be merits, and if
according to them grace is given, as the Council of Trent in plain terms
Secundum propriam cuiusque dispositionem. sess. 6. cap. 8.
defines, do they not hold that grace is given to men according to their
merits? Secondly, by this phrase truly and properly meritorious, are excluded
these works which ar^ said to merit only, ex pacto, which ever happens when
there is a great disproportion between the work and the promised reward. As if
a man should for a days labor, which in commutative justice deserves but
denarium diurnum the day-penny, promise an hundred pound; this reward were due
ex pacto, but yet not deserved by the labourer. The half of Herod's Kingdom
was due to the daughter of Her^dias, ex pacto if she had asked so much, but no
way deserved by her. By truly and properly meritorious therefore is meant
that, which is condign merit, or merit of condignity, that which is absolutely
meritorious and not only ex pacto by reason of the promise (which happens
when there is an equal proportion between the work and the promised reward)
sed ratione ^peris ipsius, for the works sake and for the worthiness thereof.

. III. This point is duly to be observed. For there are some tergiversators,
Mal. the Irish Jesuit. page 699.
that dare not professedly take upon them the defense of condign merit, who
notwithstanding would seem as stiff defenders of merits as the best of them.
As for that qnestion whether works deserve heaven ^x cond^gno or not, and such
like, they say they are but school points, which not being yet determined by
the Church may freely be disputed of pro and con. Yea, but thus much your
Church has determined, that the faithful, who are the members of Christ, do
by their works truly Conc. Trid. s^ss. 6. cap. ^6. vitam aeternam vere
promeruisse.
merit or deserve eternal life, and denounces a curse against those, who
shall deny that a justified man does by his good works truly Can. 32. vere
m^reri vitam aeternam.
merit eternal life. But there is nothing which can truly and properly be
called merit, but that which is of condignity, and does for it self, and for
its own worth absolutely deserve the reward. That which is said to merit by
way of congruity is not truly and properly meritorious, nor that which is said
merely to merit ex pacto, as where is no proportion between the merit and the
wages. For neither of these does truly deserve that which it is said to merit.
Wherefore the most, and the most learned of the Papists hold, that there is a
due proportion between the works of the faithful proceeding from charity:
and the heavenly reward, and that they condignely merit eternal life, not only
in respect of Gods promise, but also for the worthiness of the works, which
are so dignified, they say, by the merit of Christ, that they become truly
meritorious, and do in Justice, according to their worth, deserve the heavenly
reward, even as justly, as the sins of the wicked deserve the punishment of
hell. In so much that our Rhemists In Heb. 10.
say, good works be meritorious, and the very cause of salvation, so far,
that God should be unjust, if he rendered not heaven for the same, unjust (they
mean) for not rendering a just and equal reward. Where fore howsoever some
like snailes, when they are touched, do pull in their horns: yet this
undoubtedly is the Tenet of the learned Papists at this day: Bellarm. de
justif. l. 5. c. 17.
Opera bona justorum meritoria esse ex condigno, non solum ratione pacti sed
etiam ratione operum, that the good works of the righteous are condignely
meritorious, not only in regard of the covenant, but also in respect of the
works themselves. As for those, who heretofore have denied the absolute merit
of condignity, and have held either merits of congruity only, or only ex
pacto, they are censured by some of the learned Vasquez. in prima secundae. q.
114. disp. 214. cap. ^
among them to have differed from us in words, but in deed to have agreed with
us.

But as for us we acknowledge no merits of eternal life, but the merits of
Christ only: and we do constantly hold, and confidently profess, Of this
se^ more in the answer to the challenge made by a Jesuit in Ireland. page 520.
that no mere man can merit, that is, deserve at the hands of God the reward
of eternal life, by any thing, or by all the things which he can do or
suffer in this world.

. IV. For the handling of this controversy I will observe this order: first I
will propound our arguments and maintain them, and then Of the name merit.
I will answer the objections of the Papists.

And first, I will speak of the name, and then of the thing: neither of which
has any ground in the Scriptures: and therefore both the name and the thing,
of all true Christians, who desire not in matters of such moment as concern
our eternal inheritance, to be wis^ above that which is written are to be
rejected. The word mereri properly signifies to deserve, and meritum desert,
or that which deserves a reward: and that which does not deserve, is not
properly and truly called merit. Now there is neither in the canonical
Scriptures, nor in the Greek Fathers, any word or phrase truly and properly
translated, which being ascribed to good works, does signify or import the
deserving of eternal life at the hands of God. There are words and phrases
importing the reward of works both good and bad; but with this difference,
that the eternal reward of good works, as it was according to the purpose of
grace given unto us in Christ 2 Timothy 1. 9.
before all secular times, and freely intended and preordained: and according
to the Covenant of grace to them for whom Christ has merited the same, freely
promised; so it is freely bestowed as (...) the free gift of God. But the
eternal reward of sin, as it is justly deserved, so it is in justice
rendered, as the just stipend or wages of sin. Romans 6. 23. The wages of sin
is death; but eternal life is the free gif^ of God.

. V. The Latin Fathers indeed do often use the words mereri and The use of

(...).
meritum both in the better sense, and in the worse, but with this difference,
that in the worse sense they use it properly for deserving and desert. For
sins duly and in justice deserve punishment. But in the better sense, they
do not use the word properly for deserving and desert (which every man knows
to be the proper signification,) but in other significations, and therefore
unproperly, if not (...).

The verb is used by them sometimes, and indeed very often in the general
sense, either of obtaining, S^apleton* in pr^mptuar ^eria 5. post passionem

joined commonly with the accusative case, or of finding favor to have or to
get any thing, joined with the infinitive, without respect of merit and worth,
or relation to wages. Vocabulum merendi says Schol. in hymnum, nocte

most part signifies to obtain or to be made fit to obtain. The which among

word in a more special sense.
and that two ways.

First, for imp^tration and obtaining by request. And thus the Fathers say*
that men have me^ited remission of sin, justification and reconciliation wit^
God, which the Papists themselves do confess cannot be merited, Se^ (...)
ipsa remissio (...) says Augustine, Epist. 105. ad Sixtum.
sine aliquo merit^ est, si fides (...) impetrat. Where, to merit is to
impetrate, and to impe^ is to ^rit: but not in the proper sense of deserving.
For between impetrati^g and meriting in the proper sense there is great
difference, as you (...) before out of Thomas Aquinas and Bellarmine himself.
Thus Orig^ In Levit. hom. 3.
(...) pecca^um, remissionem peccati meretur Hierome, Advers. Pelag. l. 2. 285.

that notorious sinner, Augustine says, De tempor^ sermon. 5^.
tha^ when he humbled (...) before God, ita gratiam Dei ^btinuit, ut mereretur
i^ter Dei a^icos post^dum numer ari.

Sometim^ it signifies to do good works, either with relation to the reward,
or without. The former, is, as I suppose, ^he most that can be truly gathered
out of the Fathers as seeming to favor the popish sense, And yet even so it
signifies but to do^ rewardeable works, or to do such works by Gods grace
as he has promised graciously to reward.

But in the proper sense of deserving Bellarmine was not able, as after we
shall see, when we^ come to his restimonies out of the Fathers, to produce any
one testimony out of any one of them, testifying, that the good works of the
faithful in and for themselves deserve eternal life, or that they are truly
that is, condignely, and absolutely meritorious of salvation.

. VII. So much of the Verb mereri, to (...). The Noune meritum, or name merit
taken in the better part, if referred to God, it signifies his beneficia; if
to men, our officia. For those actions which the Grecians call (...), and the
Authors of the Latin tongue officia, the Latin Father^ commonly call merit^,
m^ing also officia or good works: and that either simply and without relation
to reward (which sense is most usual) or implying relation to reward. I am not
ignorant says Vega De justif. l. 8. cop. 8.
that the name merit is used of the Fathers where is Ubi est nulla ratio meriti.
no respect of merit, either of congruity, or of condignity. And as for
Augustine, he is won^ says Bellarmine De ^ratia and lib arb. l. 1. c. 14..
^anc esse.
meritum appellare quemlibet bonum actum etc. to call merit any good act in
regard where of we receive some other thing. Where it is used as the relative
of reward, it signifies no more but a rewardeable work, or a work which God
is pleased to reward. But we must remember withal, that Gods reward of
eternal life is his free gift, and not deserved by us; freely intended unto us
in our election, freely promised unto us, as the inheritance purchased by
Christ; freely given unto us as the gracious reward of our obedience, by which
he does most graciously crown his gifts, and not our merits in us, as I have
showed before at large.

. VIII. Now as touching the thing it self: Merit is best defined Of the thing
it self, what merit is.
to be a good work deserving the reward of eternal life. Some define it to be
a work, to which that reward is due. But that definition is too large, unless
it be added, that to it the reward is d^e absolutely for the works sake. For
the reward may be due ^ither by dese^, or by promise or covenant only, as
namely where there is a great disproportion between the work and the promised
reward. But that properly is not merited, which is due only by promise, and is
not deserved: when an hundred pounds is promised for a days labor in the
Vineyard where in commutative justice, the day-peny only were sufficient; the
reward indeed is due, when the labor is ended, in regard of the promise; but
yet it is not deserved by the labourer. Whatsoever the daughter of Herodias had
lawfully asked of Her^d, though it had been to the half of his kingdom, it
had been due to her by promise, but not deserved by her, for there was no
proportion between her work, or play rather, and his promised reward. No more
is there, or rather not so much, between the b^st works of the faithful, and
the eternal reward.

. IX. Now I proceed to our arguments proving that the good Arguments against
merits
works of the faithful are not truly meritorious of eternal life. My
proofs shall be either demonstrative reasons drawn from the very nature and
conditions of merit, or authorities of holy Scripture, or testimonies of the
Fathers.

Unto merit, so properly called, diverse conditions are required, in respect of
those relations which are considerable in merits; And those are either.
between the

Parties, viz. who would merit* of whom he would merit.
things Meriting, which is the merit i^ self, Merited, which is the reward.

The Parties are God and man. But man cannot merit of God, for these reasons.

First, because between God and man there is no proportion Viguerius.
Deus and homo distant in i^finitum, for God is infi^ite, man compared to God
is as nothing, Esai. 40. 17. One man indeed by doing good offices may merit of
another. But no man, that is but a man can deserve any good thing at the hands
of God. Our goodness does no^ reach unto him, Psal^. 16. 2.

Secondly, because God is the absolute Lord, of all his creatures, to whom they
owe themselves, and what^oever they can do, though no reward were to be
expected. In so much that not Adam in Paradise, nor the Angels in Heaven, nor
Christ himself, if he had been but a man, could have mer^ed any good thing
at the hands of God. God deserves of all men more than they are able to
render, and the better they are, the more they are beholding to him. He is thy
Creator ^aith De quadruplici debit^.
Bernard, thou his creature: thou the ^ervant, He the Lord: He the Potter,
thou that which the Potter frames. Tot^m ergo q^des (...) (...), ^ q^o t^tum
habes. Thou do therefore owe to him, all that thou ar^, from whom thou have
all. Although, faith he, Sermon, de verbis Origeni^.
a man may perhaps seem to render more to his neighbor than he owes: yet
never any man re^dreth to God all that he owes. Aristotle said well, Ethic.
l. 8. c. 14.
that to God and ou^ Parents we cannot render, as they deserve of us,
especially to God. For as Pereri^s, a learned Iesuire says, In Genesis 6. 5.
disput. 5.
Besides the deb^s or duties of thankef^lnesse, which none can sufficiently
render unto God; those debts also, which by Gods Commandments we are bound to
discharge, no man perfectly discharges. We therefore being no way able to
render what is due to God; but on the contrary by our ^innes making our ^elves
debtours to him, owing unto him deserved punishment; is it any less, than
antichristian insolency, or rather blasph^my, for ^infull men to profess
themselves a^le to merit any good thing at the hands of God, and to make him
their debtour? Neither can I ^ufficiently wonder, how men, whose conscience,
(if it be not cauterized) does tell them that they sin daily against God, and
by sin provoke his judgments; can speak or think of meriting any thing
injustice at the hand of God, but punishment. For as In Psalm. 94.
Augustine faith, Si Deus velle^ pr^ meritis agere, non inveniret ^isi quos
dam^aret. i. If God would deal according to merits, he should find none but
whom he should condemn.

. X. If it be said, that the Lord by promising any thing makes Whether God by
his promise makes himself a debtour.
himself a debtour for the performance of it. I answer first, with Augustine,
De verbis Apost. sermon. 16.
he is become a debtour, not by receiving any thing of us, but by promising
what he pleased, and therefore no debtour to us. For God is not debtour to
any, not so much as by covenant; for he covenanteth Non de debit^ sed de
gratui^* not for rendering a due debt, but for freely bestowing his own free
gift, nor according to debt, Romans 4. 4.
but according to grace. To whom ^hen should he be a debtour by his promise?

I answer, in the second place with 1 a. 2 ae. q. 114. ad 3 um.
Thomas: that the Lord, who is faithful and just in performing his promises,
makes himself a debtor, not to us, but to himself for the gracious
performance of his free and undeserved reward, which he had freely and
graciously promised. Thirdly, with Bonavent^re, he has made himself a debtor,
not to men, to whom he could owe nothing; but to himself, that he might be
faithful in his promises. For if God be a debtour to man, then Debet dare ei
vitam aeternam, then he ought to give him eternal life. But Hoc verbum debet
vene^m h^bet, says the Lib. 1. did. 43. dub. 3.
Master of the sentences, therefore says he, Ratio debiti, secundum quod
obligationem dicit, proprie in Deo non cadi^.

Some famous Writers (says Cassa^der) among whom is Epist. 119. page 1110.
Durandu^, deny that God by his promise is bound to us.

Fourthly, Gods fidelity and justice in giving, the reward according to his
promise, that is to say, freely, does not argue our merit, but Gods truth, who
cannot lie nor deny himself.

Fifthly, that reward which is due only ratione pacti, is not deserved ^x
ratione operis; and that which is rendered, Durand.
Non redditur ex debito operis, sed ex promissione. And therefore as it was
freely promised, so it is freely and undeservedly given.

. XI* Secondly, in the party that is to merit, it is requisite, that The party
meriting.
he should be his own man, and not the other parties man of whom he would
merit. For if he be his ^ond-servant, all that he can do is duty, not merit.
Nay, as he is not his own man, but his Lords: so his works are not his own
and for his own advantage, but for his Master. Et quicquid suo labor
acquirit, says Bellarmine, Domino suo acquirit, non sibi, and whatsoever he
gets by his labor, he gets it for his Lord, not for himself. But we
are all the serv^nts of the Lord, not only by right of creation, but also of
redemption, in regard whereof we are not our own men, but his that bought us.
1 Cor. 6. 19, 20.

And therefore a servant when he has done his duty, deserves not so much as
thanks of his Lord, Luke 17. 9, 10. Even so, when we have done all that is
commanded (which we are never able to do, but our Savior speaks by way of
supposition) we must confess that we are unprofitable servants, we have done
but what our duty was to do, and indeed not so much. The thing meriting
first* must be our own.


. XII. Thirdly, the thing by which a man should merit, ought to be thus
qualified. First, that which meriteth, quatenus meretur it must be our own,
and from our selves, and not his, nor from him of whom we would merit. But all
our good works as they are good, and (...), as the Papists hold them, and all
those virtues and graces which we have with their uses, are not our own, as
from our selves; but they are the free gifts 1 Cor. 15. 10. Esaias 26. 12.
and graces of God.

Morito debetur merces, to merit, wages is due, says De justif. lib. 5. cap.
10. te^io.
Bellarmine, Debitum autem non oritur, nisi ex ^o quod unus dat alteri, quod
su^m era^. Nam si rem non suam, sed alienam daret, nihil ei deberetu^. Now debt
arise^h not, but from this, that one man gives to another that which is his
own, for if he should give any thing which is not his own, but the other
man's, nothing should be due unto him.

Origin, In Romans 4.
Vix mihi suadeo ullum opus esse posse, quod ex debito remunerationem Dei
dep^scat: cum etiam hoc ipsum, quod agere aliquid possumus, vel cogitare, vel
proloqui, ipsius dono and largitione faciamus. I can hardly persuade my self
that there can be any works which can require as debt a reward from God,
seeing also even this that we can do or think or speak any thing, we do it
by his gift and bounty.

Dona Dei non merentur apud Deum, Gods gifts do not merit of God. By them
perhaps we may merit of others; but not of him who gave them, for it is against
sense that the doer, should by the gift received from the doner, merit of him.
All the good that a man has is from God, Vigner. cap. 9.. 3. v. 1.
and by consequent God cannot owe any thing to man. Gods gifts are his merits
of us, not ours of him. It is strange that by his gifts he should be obliged
to give more. As if by the receipt or use of an hundred pounds we should merit a
thousand.

Non talia sunt hominum merita, says De annunciat. s^rm. 1.
Bernard, ut propter ^a vita ^erna debeatur ex jure -- Nam merita omnia Dei
dona sunt, and it a homo magis propter ipsa D^o debi^or est, quam Deus homini.
Quaest. 135. (...)
Anastatius Scinaita: for when we shall offer all the good things whatsoever we
have, he does not owe to us a reward, for all are his. But no man receiving his
own things, is a debtor to give a reward to them, who offer unto him the same.

Whereunto I will add that of Et illud quod sumus, and qu^d hab^mus, sive sunt
boni actus, sive boni habitu^, seu us^s: totum est in nobis ex liberali^ate
divina, gratis dan^e and conservante. Et quia ex dono gratuito nullus obligatur
ad dandum ampli^s, sed potius recipie^s magis obligatur danti. Id^o ex bonis
habitibus and ex bonis actibus, seu usibus nobis a Deo dat is, Deus non
obligatur nobis ex aliqu^ debito justiti^ ad ali quid amplius dandum; ita quod
si non dederit sit injustus, sed potius nos sumus Deo obligati. Et sentire vel
dicere opp^situm est temerarium, seu blaspemum. I^ 2 did. 27. qu. 2.. 13. and
14.
Durandus, both that which w^e are and that also which we have, whether they be
good acts, or good habits or uses: all is in us from the liberality of God,
freely giving and conserving. And because by a free gift none is bound to give
more; but the receiver rather is more bound to the giver: wherefore by the good
habits, good acts and uses given unto ^s of God, God is not obliged to us out
of any debt of justice to give more; as if he did not give, he should be
unjust; but we rather are obliged to God. And it is a rash or blasphemous thing
to think or speak the contrary.

If it be said, that by the good use of Gods gifts we may deserve greater: I
answer, that as the good gift it self, so the good use of it is also the free
gift of God; which if God reward, he does not reward our merits, but crown
his own gifts, as A^gustine often Secondly, that which does merit must be free
and not due.
speaks.

. XIII. Secondly, that which meriteth is free not only from the necessity of
coaction (which condition the Papists acknowledge) but also of duty: for Quod
est debitum non est meritum, that which is du^ty is not merit. In rendering that
which is due, we may satisfy perhaps our debt, but not merit reward. This is
a certain truth, if the work be due, the reward is not due ratione operis
for the works sake. ^lictov. in Canonem missae.
Quid meriti apud Deum poterimus obtrudere, qui debemus omnia? How can we
plead merit before God who owe him all things? Of that which we do owe we are
not owners, the money which is owed is Aes alienum nihil proprie nostrum est,
nisi quod pro arbitrio possumus facere vel omittere, says De justif. lib. 5.
cap. 10.
Bellarmine: Nothing is properly our own, but that which we can upon free
choice do or omit.

All the good things which we can do are due from us to God, Luke 17. 10. So
that if we should do all that is commanded, we were but unprofitable servants,
because we have but done that which was our duty to do. But indeed we do
not, nor cannot perform all that is due, so far are we from merit.

Again, there is no good thing which we can do, but it is commanded of God,
and therefore due. Not to do it is a sin; to do it, is not merit but duty.

Saint De quadruplici debito.
Bernard does demonstrate for many causes, that all our good works are due
unto God, says De justif. lib. 5. cap. 14.. tertio.
Bellarmin^, so that he may exact them all; though he would give no reward.

O if thou did know, says Jbid.
Bernard, how many things and to how many thou do owe, thou should see how
they are nothing which thou do, and how not to be reckoned among the least
in comparison of thy debts.

All that thou art, thou owe to him, from whom thou have all.

And after, who then will grumble any more, saying, We labor too much, we
fast too much, we watch too much, when he is not able to answer the
thousand, yea not the least part of his debts.

Object. But it will be said, Does not he well that pays his debt? Answ. In
not paying it he should sin, but in paying he satisfies only his debt, he
does not merit a new reward.

. XIV. Thirdly, that work which meriteth must be pure and That work which
meriteth should be pure and perfect.
perfect, and not stained with any corruptions and imperfections: for otherwise
it will not so much as satisfy our debt, but rather make us obnoxious unto
punishment, every defect and imperfection being a sin: and much less will it
merit at the hands of God eternal life. But all our best obedience is
unperfect and stained with the flesh, as I have heretofore proved at large, all
our righteousnesses being as polluted cloutes. Moral. lib. 9. cap. 2.
Gregory says, Omne virtutis nostrae meritum esse vitium.

Object. 1. Yea, but the imperfection is taken away by the blood of Christ.

Answ. Where is remission of sin, there can be no merit of condignity.

Object. 2. Venial sins may stand with perfect righteousness.

Answ. True, in respect of imputed righteousness, by which sins are made
venial; but in regard of inherent righteousness, it is absurd. Fourthly, that
which meriteth is more than is due, for Debitum non est meritum, for debt is
not merit; but all that we can perform is less than that which is due.

. XV. The thing that we are to merit, that is to say, the reward: first, it
must be proportionable to the merit. For justice stands in equality.

But between the best works or sufferings of this life, yea, martyrdom it
self, and eternal life, there is no proportion. For the one is finite, the
other infinite; as being the everlasting fruition of God the infinite and
chief good. Wherefore Sermon. 1. in annunciat.
Bernard, Quid sunt, says he, omnia merita ad tantam gloriam? What are all
merits to so great glory? And In Psalm. 93.
Augustine, How great labor is that rest worthy of, which has no end. If you
will make a true comparison, and judge truly, Eternal rest is rightly bought
with eternal labor: for eternal ^n Psalm. 36. Conc. 2.
rest eternal labor should have been undertaken. Thou who art to receive
eternal happiness, thou ought to bear eternal sufferings. -- Though our
labor and tribulations were for a thousand years, weigh a thousand years
with eternity. Why do thou weigh that which is infinite, with a thing that
is finite, be it never so great.

Eusebius. Emiss. ad Monach. sermon. 3.
Non valent vitae praesentis obsequia aeternae vit^ gaudiis comparari.

^ulgent. ad Mon. Lib. 1.
Tantum ubi gratiae divinae retributionis exuberat, ut incomparabiliter and
ineffabiliter ^mne meritum q^vis bon^ and ex Deo datae humanae voluntatis and
operationis excedat.

Secondly, it should be due upon just desert, and not be given of grace, Romans
4. 4.

The day-peny given to the work of one hour is from bounty. Matthew. 20. 15.

But eternal life is given freely by Gods grace, Romans 6. 23.

Of the wicked, In Mat. 25. 46. Homil. 79*
Chrysostom says, (...), these are justly punished: but of the godly, (...)*
and they are crowned according to grace. (...). For although they should
perform ten thousand works, it is the So the word (...) is sometimes used by
approved Authors, as Dem^stbenes, Plutarch, Gregory, Nazianzen, in which sense
(...) sometime signifies (...) id munificientia and liberalitate riclare* cere.
munificence of grace that for such small and vile works such an heaven and
kingdom, and so great an honor should be given them.

Thirdly, the rule by which rewardis rendered to condign merits, is not mere
grace but justice, and that either commutative, which See Hener. Stephani
Thesaurum. Tom. 3. Col. 1559. A and H ex Dudaeo.
stands in equality, or distributive, which respects dignity: the former*
observing an arithmeticall; the other, a geometrical proportion. But neither
is their equality between ^he merit and the reward: The rule, a^cording to
which the reward is rendered
neither are the things which we do or suffer condign, or any way comparable
to the glory that shall be revealed. But the reward of eternal life is given
of mere grace in respect of us, Romans 6. 23. According to the good pleasure of
God, Luke 12. 32. Who crowne^h us with mercies, Psalm. 103. 4. For by grace we
are saved and not by works, Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. Now we must remember, that that
grace is not grace any way, which is not gracious every way. August. contr.
Pelag. and Coelest. l. 2. c. 24.
Non enim gratia Dei gratia erit ullo modo, nisi fuerit gratuita omni modo.

. XVI. These conditions of merit, whereof none agrees to our works, as I have
showed, all of them are found in Christ's meritorious obedience both active and
passive. The three first, because our Savior was and is both God and man. The
fourth with all the four branches thereof: for first, it was his own and from
himself. Mereri ^jus est, says Hilarie De Trin. l. 11.
qui sibi ipse meriti acquirendi author existat. For although what he had, he
had from God, yet he had his power of meriting not from an external principle,
but from himself as being God, not by grace, but by nature and by generation.
Secondly, it was libera and non debita, free and not of duty because he is
God. Esa. 53. 7. Oblatus est quia ipse voluit, Ioh. 10. 17, 18. Thirdly, it was
most perfect: absolute. The seventh, because it was more than he did owe. The
eighth because his merits are of infinite value, and therefore condign to the
glory which shall be revealed. Insomuch that Pope Clement, whom Bellarmine De
justif. l. 5. c. 12.. secunda. ex epist. decret. Clem. 6. q^ae incipit,
u^igenitus
does follow, did not stick to say, guttam unam sanguinis Christi propter
infinitam personae dignitatem, ad totius mundi redemptionem sufficere p^tuisse.
The ninth, because by his sufferings the justice of God is fully satisfied, and
by his obedience heaven is al-sufficiently merited for us, even according to
the rule of justice.

But not one of the nine conditions agrees to the obedience and sufferings of
any mortal man. Therefore not the obedience of any mere man is truly and
properly meritorious, but only the obedience of Christ: to whom alone merit is
properly to be ascribed.

To these reasons we may add all those arguments which I produced, either to
prove, that we are not justified by any righteousness inherent; or that we are
not justified nor saved by works: which arguments for number were many, and for
strength impregnable; but especially those which did prove, either that all our
obedience is defective and stained with the flesh, or that we are not able
perfectly to fulfill the Law of God. For if our obedience be unperfect and
defective, then is it far from meriting any thing, but punishment. And if we
be not able to ^lfill the Law, then are we in our selves subject to the Curse
of the Law, so far are we from meriting heaven by our own obedience.

CHAP. VIII. Testimonies of Scripture disproving merits, vindicated from
Bellarmines cavills.
. I.

NOw I come to testimonies of Scriptures: and first those which Bellarmine by
his sophistry seeks De justif. l. 5. c. 5.
to wring from us. And first we allege those testimonies, which ascribe the
reward of good works to Gods mercy, and not to our merits. As Exodus 20. 6.
Psalm. 62. 12. and 103. 4, 17. Gal. 6. 16. Mat. 5. 7. But more specially Tit.
3. 5. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. From whence we argue thus.

That which is freely given of Gods mere mercy and grace, is not rendered to
our merits, as deserved thereby: and whatsoever is rendered as due to our
merits, that is not given of grace.

Eternal life is freely given of Gods mere mercy and grace; which is proved
by the testimonies alleged.

Therefore it is not rendered to our merits, as deserved thereby.

To the proposition Bellarmine seems to answer, or rather to the conclusion:
that eternal life, though it be rendered to our merits, yet is given of Gods
free mercy. But the proposition is generally true. For to him that works,
and by his work meriteth, the reward is given, not according to grace, but
according to debt, Romans 4. 4 And such is the opposition between merit and
grace, that what is of grace, is not of works: and what is of works is not of
grace, Romans 11. 6. Omne meritum, says Aquinas, 1a. 2^. q. 114. art. 5.
repugnat gratiae. And Bellarmine himself De gratia and lib. arbitr. lib. 1.
cap. 1. initi^.
Gratia inde n^men accepit, quod gratis detur; opp^nitur autem debito. Likewise
Bernard: In Cantic. sermon. 67.
Non est quo gratia intret, ubi iam meritum occupavit. And again, Deest
gratiae quicquid meritis deputas, So that grace and works, mercy and merit
cannot stand together. If therefore eternal life be of works, it is not of
grace and if of merit, then not of mercy.

. II. Yea, but Bellarmine will prove, that eternal life is to be ascribed
Bellarmines objections, that eternal life is to be ascribed both to mercy and
merit.
both to Gods mercy and our merit, by two expositions which he says Augustine
Epist. 105. ad Sixtum.
gives of the places alleged: the one, (wherein he joyneth Gregory Jn Psalm.
7. poenit. verse. 8.
with him.) That eternal life, though it be the due reward of merits, yet it
is called gratia, because the merits themselves, to which it is rendered, are
the free gifts of grace. Whereunto I reply, that the assertions both of
Augustine and also of Gregory, make strongly against the D^ corrept. and gratia
c. 13.
merit of condignity. For if eternal life be called grace, as he faith,
because it is freely given; and the good works which he unproperly calls
merits, be also the free gifts of God: how is it possible, that eternal life
should be rendered to them as a deserved reward? ^f it be freely given, how is
it rendered as a debt? If good works be Gods free gifts, they m^ke us debtours
to God, not him to us. Augustine in that Epistle cited by Bellarmiue, says,
Epist. 105. ad Sixtum. p. 298.
Debita redditur poena damnato, indebita gratia liberato: ut nec ille se
indignum queratur, nec dignum se iste glorietur, -- si autem gratia, nullis
utique meritis reddita, sed gratuita bonitate donata. And again Ipsa vita
aeterna -- gratia nuncupatur, nec ob aliud, nisi quia gratis detur. And yet
again. Quaerimus meritum misericordiae, nec invenimus, quia nullum est; ne
gratia evacuetur, si non gratis donatur, sed meritis redditur. Augustine
therefore speaks of good works as the free gifts of Gods grace: and
therefore not merits properly, but only such works, as God will freely
reward, Bellarmine himself being the Interpreter: and of eternal life he
speaks, as the free and undeserved reward of good works, quae gratia
nuncupatur, non ob aliud, nisi quia gratis datur. Eternal life is called
grace, for no other respect, but because it is freely given. The same Augustine
In Psalm. 62.
writing on those words of Psalm. 63. 3. Melior est misericordia super vitas,
says; Multae sunc vitae humanae, sed Deus unam vitam promittis, and non illam
dat nobis, quasi propter merita nostra, sed prop^er misericordiam suam. Gregory
In Psalm poenit. 7. verse. 8.
writing on those words, Psalm. 143. 8. Cause me to hear thy mercy in the
morning: where, by morning he understands the future resurrection, wherein
Gods mercy shall be showed toward the faithful, he frames this objection.
If that felicity of the Saints be mercy; and is not acquired by merits, what
shall become of that which is written; And thou shall render to every one
according to his works? If it be rendered according to works, how shall it be
accounted mercy? Whereunto he gives two answers, both of them making against
merit. The first, Sed aliud est secundum opera reddere, and aliud propter ipsa
operareddere. It is one thing to render according to works; another to render
for the works themselves: for in that which is said according to works, the
quality of the works is meant, that whose works shall appear to be good, his
retribution may be glorious: according to works therefore, is according to the
quality of them whether 2 Cor. 5. 10.
good or evil. For if good, then he will reward them with bliss, if evil,
then will he condemn them. For to that blessed life, says he, wherein we live
with God and of God, no labor can be matched, no works can be compared,
especially seeing the Apo^tle says, the sufferings of this life are not
condign to the future glory which shall be revealed in us. His other answer:
howbeit in this respect also it may be called mercy, because it is given for
such works, as no man can attain unto without mercy. It is evident therefore
(says he) that to whom God in mercy gives grace to work well in this life,
to them in greater mercy he grants that in eternal bliss they shall be
rewarded with an hundred fold, this is that grace, which for grace the Apostle
says shall be given to the Saints of God: that unto whom in this life the
grace of sanctification is given of God, to them the grace of eternal
happiness is given in the life to come: which also makes strongly against
merits* both because eternal life is a free gift, and also because that
righteousness to which it is given is a free gift: and because greater mercy
is showed in giving glory; than in giving gracc.

. III. The second exposition which he assigns to Augustine is a Augustines
second exposition.
fiction of his own brain, viz. that in the crowning of the Saints mercy is
necessary for the remission of venial sins. Not that th^s mercy, says he,
is the Crown of life, but because it does accompany it; the Crown of life
being given to their merits, and the remission granted to their venial
offenses: which fiction, as it is falsely fathered upon Aug. so it is not
agreeable to the doctrine of the Church of Rome, nor consonant to the truth it
self. For seeing in the faithful, sin according to the truth, both in respect
of the guilt, and also of the corruption is wholly taken away in the end of
this life, or according to the Church of Romes doctrine, is purged and taken
away by the fire of Purgatory: it is a great absurdity to imagine, that the
faithful, whose souls before the resurrection enjoy (as they also teach) the
beatifical vision, should after the resurrection need remission of venial sins.

. IV. For our second argument Bellarmine propounds in our behalf two object.
out of Esa. 55. 1. and Dan. 9. 18. which he says might Esaias. 55. 1. Come, buy
without silver. Not in our righteousnesses, but in thy great mercic^. Dan. 9.
18.
be made. The former whereof is availeable against the merit of grace, not only
the first, which he confesses* but the second also: and not only against
merit of grace but of glory, for that also is promised without price, the later
against affiance reposed in our own merits. For if we are not to trust in them
for the obtaining of temporal benefits, whereof Bellar. understands the Prophet
to speak, then much less eternal, between which and our supposed merits,
there is a far g^eater disproportion. Our third arg. Luke 17. 7, 8, 9, 10.


. V. Our third argument is taken out of Luke 17. 7, 8. 9. 10. Which of you
having a servant plowing, or feeding cattle, will say unto him by and by when
he is come from the field. Go and sitdown to meat? and will not rather say unto
him, make ready wherewith I may sup, and gird thy self and serve me till I have
eaten and drunken; and afterward thou shall eat and drink. Does he thank that
servant, because he did the things that were commanded him? I ^row not. So
likewise you when you shall h^ve done all these things which are commanded you
(which is spoken by supposition, and is all one with this connexive, If you
shall do all things which are commanded you) say, we are unprofitable
servants, we have done that which was our duty to do. Which place affords
three unanswerable arguments against the merit of condignity* taken from three
of those conditions required in merits, which before were mentioned. The first
in respect of God, who is our absolute Lord. The second in respect of us, who
are his bondservants: the third in respect of our works, because all that we
can do, though we should, do all that is commanded, is but our duty. Three
arguments from hence collected.


. VI. For the first, if earthly Masters (who with their servants are fellow*
servants to one heavenly Master) do not owe so much as thanks to their
servants for doing that which they command; then much less The first and
second.
our heavenly Master, who is our absolut^ Lord, does owe the heavenly reward to
his servants, when they do^ that which he commands; though they should do
all that is commanded, which they are never able to do:

For the second: I^ bondservants who are not their own but their masters men
(for a servant as the Philosopher says,) is (...), and altogether his man,
another man's man) do owe themselves and all that they can do to their master,
and cannot deserve so much as thanks at his hands, for doing what he
commands: (though Luke 17. 7, 8.
they do all that is commanded, and although, their service be profitable to
their master and finally though they receive not from him either the will or
power of yielding obedience to him,) but all that they can desire or expect by
their uttermost endeavor is to be (...), w^ll pleasing to their master; when if
their service be any way defective, are well apayed if they escape the whip, as
T^ophyl. in Luke 17. Necessity is l^id ^, on a servant, to fulsill the
Commandments of his Lord. -- If therefore he do not perform he is to be
accounred worthy of stripes, but if he do perform, (...), let this suffice
him that he has escaped the whippe.
Theophylact speaks: how much les^e we, who are the Lords mancipia and
bondservants, both by the right of creation and by the right of redemption
(being in regard thereof servi quia servati) and consequently not our own men,
but his who has made and redeemed us, and therefore do owe our selves and
all, yea more than all we can do: do we or can we deserve at the hands of
God the reward of eternal life, by doing what he commands, though we should
do all that is commanded, which we never do? Especially, seeing and also
seeming that we do not all that is commanded, and lastly seeing that our
service bring^th him no profit, Job. 22. 2, 3. and 35. 7. for that which we
do, we receive both the will and power from him. Wherefore all that in reason
we can desire or expect in regard of our obedience is that we may be well
pleasing unto him. Yea, forasmuch as our service is always defective and
unperfect, we ought to think our selves mercifully Phil. 2. 13.
dealt with, if we escape the punishment, which by the Law of God is due unto
us. But here it will be said, if the master shall be pleased to promise
rewards unto the servant for his service well performed: may not the servant
expect the promised reward? I answer, that what reward soever shall in this
kind be either promised or given, it is wholly to be ascribed to the Masters
bounty and not to the servants merit. The third.


. VII. For the third: That which is done of mere duty by a servant to his
Lord, there belongs no reward in justice, as deserved by him. But all that
we, who are the servants of God, can do, though we should do all that is
commanded, is done of mere bounden duty to our Lord. Therefore to all that we
can do, though we should do all that is commanded, there belongs no reward,
as justly deserved by us. But when we have done all that is commanded (I speak
by supposition, as our Savior does) we must no less truly than humbly
confess, that we are unprofitable servants: that is, as is manifestly
gathered out of the parable, such as cannot deserve so much as thanks of our
Lord. If therefore our gracious Lord shall be pleased out of his bounty freely
to promise, and according to his promise graciously to reward our imperfect
obedience, which he might justly punish: it is not our merit, but his great
mercy that he does not punish it: more that he does accept of it as well
pleasing unto him in his welbeloved; but most of all, that he does most
graciously and undeservedly reward it. From whence I reason thus:

Whosoever are unprofitable servants they do not merit no^ deserve the reward
of eternal life of their Lord. All the faithful, though they should do all
that is commanded, are unprofitable servants: Therefore none of the faithful,
though they should do all that is commanded, do merit or deserve at the hands
of God, (the reward of eternal life. And if they, who do all that is
commanded, cannot merit; then much less they whose obedience is defective; as
the obedience even of the best is. So says Hierome Ad Ctestphont* contr. Pelag.
si inutilis est qui fecit omnia: quid de illo dicendum, qui explerenon potuit?

. VIII. The assumption is proved, first, because our Savior All the faithful
are unprofitable servants.
commands his Apostles to confess, as the truth is, that when they have done
all that is commanded, they are unprofitable servants, and therefore they, who
neither do, nor can do all, are impudent liars, when they profess themselves
to be profitable servants. Secondly, by a comparison of earthly Lords and
servants. For if earthly Lords and masters owe not so much as thanks to their
servants (who are indeed their fellow servants) for all the service which they
can do; though they do not give them the will and the power to do them
acceptable service: how much less does God, who being our absolute Lord does
also give us will and power to serve him, owe unto his servants the reward of
the kingdom of heaven? And if servants by doing all possible service to their
earthly masters, who are but their fellow servants, cannot deserve so much as
thanks at their hands: how much less can we, who serve the Lord of Lords,
deserve the kingdom of heaven at his hands by our unperfect and defective
service of him. Thirdly, from the antithesis or opposition that is between
debitum and merit^m, duty and merit. For he that does but his duty, though
he perform his whole duty, cannot merit a reward of his Master, but must
confess himself to be an unprofitable servant: how much less can they merit
an heavenly reward at the hands of God, who perform not their whole duty, but
fail in many particulars, both by omission and commission, as the very best of
us do.

. IX. To avoid the force of this unavoidable argument, Bellarmine Bellarmines
evasions, by four expositions.
seeks many eva^ions, which he would gladly father upon the Fathers of the
Church. For he says there be four egregious expositions given by the Fathers;
none whereof make against the merit of good works. The first, of Saint Ambrose
In Luc. l. 8. cap. 17.
that of our selves and by nature we are unprofitable servants ^apt and unable
to fulfill Gods Commandments, The first of Ambrose.
which our Savior would have us humbly to acknowledge; though by grace we
become profitable, and therefore as he says, agnoscenda est gratia, sed non
ignoranda natura. Reply, Ambrose does not speak of our corrupt nature; neither
is it his meaning that by nature we are unprofitable servants, by grace
profitable, but that by nature we are servants, and by grace sons. For by
nature corrupted we are not the servants of God, but of sin and Satan. But
he understands the meaning of our Savior to be, that the children of God,
who are in the state of grace, should not glory in their works, as if by them
they did merit any thing of God, quia jure Domino debemus obsequium. because by
right we owe obedience to God. Neither should we think our selves exempted
from continued obedience, because we are sons: for as we are sons by the
grace of adoption) which we are to acknowledge) so by nature and creation
(whereof we are not to be ignorant) we are servants. As therefore thou, who art
a master, do not content thy self with one work of thy servant, and then
biddest him sit down and eat, but having done one work thou exactest of him
another, verse. 8. So God does not require the use of one work in thee: but
whiles we live we must always work. Secondly, our Savior does not speak of
natural men, as being unprofitable, because unapt to fulfill Gods
Commandments: but directs his speech to the faithful, and namely, to his
own Apostles and Disciples, who study and endeavor to keep all Gods
Commandments, (which without grace cannot be done) requiring them to make this
humble and true confession, that even when they have done all that is
commanded, they are but unprofitable servants, such as are described in the
parable, who deserve nothing at the hands of their master: because in doing all
that is commanded, they do but their bounden duty, and that excludes merit.
For debitum non est meritum.

Yea, but Bellarmine proves out of 2 Timothy 2. 21. that by grace men 2 Timothy 2.
21.
become profitable to God. For he that purges himself shall become a vessel
profitable unto the Lord. Answ. The Greek is (...), fit for the master of the
house to use for the benefit of the household, and fitted for every good work.
But that our piety or obedience brings no profit to God, I have showed
before. And this is the very second exposition of this place, which though
repugnant to this present assertion, Bellarmine himself does commend in the
second place. For so he says, The second evasion, the exposition of Bid.


. X. We are commanded, as Bede expounds this Text, to acknowledge that we
bring no profit to God: but that what good thing soever we do, is profitable
to our selves but not to God. Reply, Beda gives two reasons (though Bellarmine
conceal the better) why we doing that, which is commanded, are notwithstanding
called unprofitable servants. The former, quia Dominus bonorum nostrorum non
indiget, because the Lord has no need of our good things. Which, though true
yet does neither so well fit the comparison, wherein the servant, though
useful to his master both abroad and at home, could not by all his endeavor
deserve to himself so much as thanks* neither agreeable to the reason which
our Savior renders, because we have ^one what is our duty to do.

The latter: we are unprofitable servants, because says he, Non sunt condignae
etc. The sufferings of this life are not worthy of the glory that shall be
reavealed, (that is, because we cannot deserve the reward of eternal life by
our service.) But as it is elsewhere said (says he) who crowns thee in mercy
and loving kindness: he does not say in thy merits and works: because by
whose mercy we are prevented that we may in humility serve God, by his gift
we are crowned, that in sublimity we may reign with him. So Bid.

. XI. The third exposition he says is Augustines: viz. That His third evasion,
the exposition of Augustine.
we may be called unprofitable servants, when we have kept all Gods
Commandments, because we do no more than our duty (which indeed is the reason
which Christ himself does render) neither can we from thence demand De verbis
Domi sermon. 3.
any just reward, unless God had made a liberal Covenant with us. For by our
condition we are the bond-servants of God; and if he will, he may bind us to
perform all manner of works, as it pleases him, without reward. This our
condition Christ, for the preservation of humility, would have us to
acknowledge. Howbeit by his gracious covenant we may expect reward, 2 Timothy 4.
7, 8. Matthew. 20. 13. Which God in his great bounty has promised to this end,
that thereby he might draw us to performance of our duty, as Augustine
teaches.

Replpy, This answer of Bellaamine is worthy to be observed, or rather
admired: first, for the impudency of it, in that he fathereth this exposition
upon Augustine, who in the place by him quoted, does not once mention this Text
of Luke 17. 10. nor has one word to that purpose for which this exposition is
alleged; excepting the clause of Gods bounty, which, as it proves this to be
that very testimony of Augustine, which he quoteth, so does it evidently
exclude merit. Secondly, for the force of truth, which forces him to
contradict his own assertions, both here, and in other places. For first, he
confesses, that he which does no more but his duty, does not merit: and that
we do no more but our duty. Whereupon it follows, that we do not merit.
Secondly, where he confesses, that we can do no more than our duty, he
renounceth all works of supererrogation. And thirdly, in that he confesses,
that for the same cause we are unprofitable servants, he takes away all merit
of condignity. Fourthly, he confesses, that without Gods gracious promise we
could expect no reward. Which proves, that the reward is due only ratione
pacti, and not ratione ipsius operis, which afterward he denies. Fifthly, he
confesses, that such is the bounty and goodness of God, that to allure us to
the performance of our duty, he does freely promise a reward. Now what God
does freely promise to give, he gives freely and without desert. For eternal
life, which in his word he has promised as a reward, in his eternal counsel
he purposed freely without any respect of our worthynesse to bestow upon us:
and what in mercy he either purposed or promised, Christ by his merit has
purchased for us. So that we attain to heaven by a threefold right. By Gods
free donation electing us in Christ, as his free gift. Secondly, by Christ's
merit, as our inheritance: Thirdly, by Gods free promise, as his gracious
reward, whereby he crowns not our merits, but his own gifts and graces in
us. God indeed has promised freely to reward our works: but that our works
should merit the reward, he has no where promised, or taught. His fourth
evasion, the exposition of Chrysostom. in illu delatum est co^ Ozi^. 2 Cbron. 26.
16.


. XII. His fourth exposition is of Chrysostom: that the Lord does not say, ye
are unprofitable servants, but bids them say so: which is true. But what
will Bellarmine infer therefrom, that therefore they were not so? God forbid!
For then our Savior should have taught his Disciples to lie. Neither does God
allow of counterfeit humility. But the meaning of our Savior was, to teach his
Disciples in humility to confess the truth: that because they had but done
their duty, if they had done all that is commanded, they should not be lifted
up with a proud conceit, that thereby they had merited: but should no less
truly, than humbly confess, that they were unprofitable servants, who by doing
no more than their duty, could not merit of God. And this objection is also
answered by De ^riplici custodia.
Bernard. Sed hoc inquies propter humilitatem monuit omne dicendum. Plane
propter humilitatem: numquid contra veritatem? But you will say, that for
humility sake he admonishes them thus to say. No doubt for humility. But did
he bid them speak against verity? And the same is taught by In Coloss. 1. 12.
^om. 2.
Chrysostom elsewhere. No man, says he, does show forth such a
conversation, as to be worthy of the kingdom, but it is wholly of his gift,
therefore he says, when you shall do all that is commanded, say we are
unprofitable servants, we have done what is our duty to do. And again in
another place, where he shows, that what the Son of God did for us he did
not of duty: (...). homil. 7. in Romans (...)
but what good we do, we do it of duty. Wherefore himself said, when you
shall have done all, say ye are unprofitable servants, for we have done what
was our duty to do. If therefore we show forth love, if we give our goods to
the poor we perform our duty, etc.

Object. Yea, but the servants, Mat. 25. 21, 23.
which employed their Talents well, were commended, as profitable servants.
Answ. They were commended as good servants and faithful to their master. And
of him, because they profitably employed their Talents, were graciously
rewarded. But of their merit nothing is said. If they had not employed their
Talents well, they should have been punished. And in that they did employ them
well, they did but their duty, and that also by assistance of Gods grace, who
both gave them the Talents, and grace to employ them well, and therefore though
they had reward, yet they did not merit it.

. XIII. Our fourth Testimony is Romans 6. 23. For the stipend Our fonrth
testi^ony. Romans 6. 23.
of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through JESUS
CHRIST our LORD: where is an antithe^is or opposition between death, meaning
eternal death, the reward of sin, and eternal life the reward of
righteousness: that death is the stipend of sin justly merited by it: but
eternal life is not a stipend or wages merited by us, but (...). the free gift
of God; which is a most pregnant place: for if the Apostle had supposed
eternal life to be a stipend or wages, or merited reward, he would have said,
that as death is the stipend of sin, so eternal life is the stipend of
righteousness. But the Apostle making an opposition between the reward of
sin and the reward of righteousness, says, that the one is (...), a
military stipend due to those who serve under Satan's colors; the other is not
a stipend or wages deserved, but (...) the free gift of God. (...) signifies a
military stipend or wages due to soldiers. As when John Baptist bids the
soldiers to be content (...) with their stipend, Luke 3. 14. So 1 Cor. 9. 7.
For as Augustine says, Ep. 105. p. 302.
Quod est merces operanti hoc militanti stipendium, and worthily, says he, is
death called a Stipendium, De gratia and lib. arb. cap. 9.
Quia militiae diabolicae mors aeterna tanquam debitum redditur.

The word (...), which the vulgar Latin translateth Gratia, signifies a free
gift, not rendered as due to the merit of the receiver, but vouchsafed freely
out of the free bounty and undeserved favor of the giver. For as Primasius
says, In Romans 11.
Non est gratia, si non gratis datur, si debita merentibus redditur, quod
absit! And Augustine, Contra Pelag. and Coelest. de orig. pec. lib. 2. cap. 24.
Non erit Dei gratia ullo modo, nisi gratuita fuerit omni modo: wherefore it is
called Gratia, that we may understand it is of grace, and not not of merits.
The Verb (...) whence it is derived, signifies, freely to bestow, to
gratify, or graciously to give. And therefore is eternal life called (...),
because God (...) does freely bestow it. The Argument stands thus. A free
gift, which is opposed to stipend or wages, is not merited by us. Eternal life
is the free gift of God and is opposed to stipend or wages; therefore it is not
merited by us.

. XIV. Bellarmine answers, that Augustine has diligently answered
Bellarmin^s answer out of Augustine.
this argument, Epist. 105. Enchirid. ^ap. 107. But chiefly In libro de gratia
and lib. arb. cap. 8. and 9. From whence he gathers two Assertions. First,
That the Apostle might well have said, eternal life is the stipend of
righteousness, even as he said, The stipend of sin is death; which
confession of Augustine cutteth the thr^at (he says) of our Assertion.
S^condly, That the Apostle did not say, Eternal life is the stipend of
righteousness, as he said, Death is the stipend of sin, least any man should
think, that we so have righteousness of ourselves, as we have sin of our
selves: therefore eternal life is called grace, not because it is not the
reward of merit, but that we have the merits themselves from grace.

To the former, I reply, that when Augustine says, that eternal life might
well be called a stipend, which he makes to be all one with merces, he
means a stipend or reward freely given; as if there were stipendium
grat^itum, as well as merces gratuita. And that this was his meaning, I
demonstrate out of the same places, which Bellarmine does quote, and first out
of Epist. 105. Debita redditur p^na demnato, indebita gratia liberato, ^t nec
ille se indignum queratur, n^c dignum se iste glorietur. Si antem gratia, atque
null is meritis reddits, sed gratuita b^nitate donata; -- ipsa (aterna vita)
gratia nuncupatur, n^n ob ali^d nisi quia gratis datur.

Secondly, Enchirid. cap. 107. Ipsam vitam aeternam quae certa merces est
operum bonorum, gratiam Dei appellat Apostolus: stipendium enim inquit,
p^ccatimors, gratia autem Dei vita aeterna in Christo Jesus Domin^ n^stro*
stipendium pro opere militiae debitum redditur, non donatur. Id^o dixit,
stipendium peccatimors, ut mortem peccato non immerito illatam, sed debitam
demonstraret. Gratia vero nisi gratis sit, gratia non est.

Thirdly, Praefat. in Psalm. 31. Merces nostra gratia vocatur: figrati^ est,
gratis datur, quid est gratis datur? Gratis c^nstat -- Si reddatur tibi quod
debetur, puniendus es, quid ergo fit? Non tibi Deus r^ddit debitam poenam, sed
donat indebitam gratiam.

Fourthly, Degratia and lib. arbitr. cap. 9. Cum Apostolus prius dixisset,
stipendium peccatim^rs: merit^ (inquit) stipendium quia militiae diabolicae
mors aeterna tanquam debitum redditur. Vbi cum posset dicere, and recte dicere,
stipendium autem justitiae vita aeterna: maluit dicere, Gratia autem Dei vita
aetern^: ut hinc intelligamus non meritis nostris Deum nos ad aeternam vitam,
sed pro sua miseratione perducere. Whereby it appears, that although he
says, that eternal life may be called a stipend: yet he means not a
stipend or wages deserved, or merited by us, but a reward freely given us of
God.

. XV. And as the former Assertion makes not against us, so the The second
Assertion.
later makes wholly for us against both the Pelagians and the Papists. The
Pelagians held, that their good works were done not by the help of grace, but
by the strength of their own free will, and so in that respect a reward was
due unto them; whereas they who bring forth good works ex done gratiae, had
neither commendation nor merit. Against them Augustine in many places
disputes, proving that eternal life, which is the reward of our good works,
is called by the Apostle Gratia, not only because it self is freely given,
but also because the good works, whereof it is the reward, are to be ascribed
to Gods grace. And that therefore the Lord when he rewards the godly life of
the faithful with eternal life, he gives them gratiam progratia, and that
when he rewards our merits, thereby meaning our good works, he does crown
not our merits, but his own graces. Thus he writes, Epist. 105. page 301.
Omne meritum nostrum non in nobis facit nisi gratia: and cum Deus c^ronat
merit^ n^stra, nihil aliud (...) quam muner^ su^, Sic^t enim ab initio fidei
misericordiam consecuti sumus, non quia fideles eramus, sed ut esse^us: sic in
fin^ quod erit in vita aeterna, c^ronabit nos sicut scriptum est, Psalm. 103. 4.
in miseratione and misericordia. -- Vnde and ipsa vita aeterna, qu^ utique in
fine sine fine habebitur, and ideo merit is praecedentibus redditur: tamen qui^
eadem merita quibus redditur, non a nobis parata sunt per n^stram
sufficientiam, sed in nobis facta per grati^m, etiam ipsa gr^tia nuncupatur,
Non ob aliud ni^i quia gratis datur; nec ideo qui^ meritis non datur, sed quia
data sunt page 302.
and ipsa merita quibus datur.

Stipendium peccati mors, recte stipendium quia debetur, quia digne
retribuitur, quia merit^ redditur. Deinde, ne justiti^ de humanose extolleret
(...); sicut humanum meritum malum non dubitatur esse peccatum, non a contra^
retulit dicens, ^ipendium justitiae vita ^terna, and haec ne praeter Mediatorem
aliqua alia via quaereretur, adjecit in Christo Jesus Domino nostro tanquam
diceret, Audit^, quod stip^ndium pecca^i sit mors, quid te disponis extollere?
O humana non justitia, sed nomine justitiae plane superbi^, quid te disponis
extollere, ac contrariam morti vitam aeternam, tanquam d^bitum stipendium
flagitare?

Quapr^pter O homo si accepturus es vitam aeternam, justitiae quidem stipendium
est, sed tibi gratia est, cui gratia and ipsa justitia. Tibi enim tanquam
d^bita reddere^ur, si ex tetibi esset justiti^, cui debet^r. Nunc igitur de
plenitudine ejus accepimus, non s^lum gratiam, qua nunc just in laboribus
usque in finem vivimus, sed etiam gratiam pro hac gratia, ut in requie postea
sine fine vivamus.

Enc^id. cap. 107.
Intelligendum est igitur etiam ipsa hominis b^na merita esse Dei munera;
quibus cum vita aeternae redditur, Quid ^isi gratia pro gratia redditur?

Degratia and li^. arb. cap. 8.
Vita bona nostra nihil aliud est, quam Dei gratia sine dubi^ and vita etena,
quae bonae vitae readitur, Dei gratia est. Et ipsa enim gratis datur, quia
gratis data est illa c^i datur. Sed illa cui datur tantummod^ gratia est: haec
autem quae illi datur qu^niam praemium ejus est, gr^tia est pr^gratia, tanquam
merces pro justi^ia.

That which Augustine speaks of the grace of justification, is true of all
grace. De gratia Christi, cap. 23.
Quomod^ est gratia, si ex debito redditur? How is it grace if it be rendered of
duty?

. XI. The Papists, when they are pressed with the authority of Saint Augustine,
would seem to differ much from the Pelagians; but it is more in show, than in
truth. For they do hold the merit of congruity, and that grace is given to
men according to their own preparations Conc. Trid. Sess. 6. cap. 7. and Can.
9.
and dispositions, and that the efficacy of grace, when it is offered, is so to
be ascribed to our own free will, as that it is in our own power, either to
accept or reject it. For this De hares. lib. 7. tit. Gratia.
Alphonsus a Castro setteh down as a Catholic Assertion, that when God has
stirred up our will to that which is good, it is in the power of man's will
either to assent to Gods monition, or to dissent. Ex h^c autem qu^d nos
monitioni illius consentimus, qui tamen dissentire p^teramus, debetur nobis
merces and precium, and inde meritum nostrum. And so our Rhemists, that those
whom God pardons work by their own free will, and thereby deserve their
own salvation. If therefore the grace of righteousness, or the grace of
glory, be deserved by us, both which the Papists teach; the former, by merit of
congruity, the latter by merit of condignity; then, contrary to Augustines
Assertion, neither the one nor the other is to be called grace. For that he
denies to be truly called grace, which is not omni ^odo gratuita. So much
concerning Augustines exposition; now let us search the judgments of some
others of the Fathers.

Tertullian interprets this Text thus: Stipendi^ delinquentiae The exposition
of other Fathers.

In Romans 6. homil. 12.
Chrysostom, the Apostle having spoken of the wages of sin, concerning the
good he does not observe the same order, for he did not say (...) the wages of
your good deeds, but the free gift of God: showing that they were not delivered
of themselves, nor received (...) a due debt, nor retribution or remuneration
of their labors, but that all things came to them by grace.

In Romans 6.
Theodoret, worthily he called death (...) a military stipend, but here (says
he, upon those words, Gratia autem Dei) he does not say, wages, but grace: for
eternal life is the gift of God. For although a man should perform very great
and absolute righteousness: yet temporal labors are not equivalent to
eternal blessings.

Theophylact, Sin to its servants, for a reward of their service, renders

grace all these things happen to you in Christ, who works these things.

In locum.
Haymo, What is it, that speaking of the reward of sin, ^e calls it
stipend, but of the remuneration of the Elect, he calls it the grace of God.
For they that go to warfare receive their own wages; but whatsoever the Elect
have, they receive it wholly from the grace of God, whether they have faith or
charity, or any good work: and moreover for this grace of faith and good
works, gratis accipiunt, they freely receive eternal life, etc. And the same
has Rhemigius.

And to these you may add two famous Cardinals, the one In locum.

of the free gift of God.

. XIII. Our fifth Testimony is Romans 8. 18. which our Rhemists De interpell. l.
1. cap. 1. in Psalm. 118. s^rm. 20.
according to the vulgar Latin read thus. For I think, that the passions of
this time are not condign to the glory to come that shall be revealed in us:
which words so translated, non condignae, or as De Jacob. lib. 1. cap. 6.
Ambrose and Epist. 22. De bono mortis l 83. qu^st. 67. De Civit. D^i lib. 5.
cap. 18.
Augustine in many places read indign^, are a direct contradiction to the merit
of condignity. Neither ought they to cavil at our former translations, which
read they are not worthy. For what is their non condignae, or Ambrose and
Augustines indignae, but not worthy, or unworthy. And what is it not to be
worthy, or to be unworthy, but not to deserve? Yea, Bellarmine himself both in
his second and third chapters De justif. l. 5. c. 2.. alia l^ca. cap. 3. arg. 6.
endeavors to prove merit from all those places, where the word worthy is
used; for dignum esse praemio, says he, and mereri pr aemium idem sunt, be
worthy of reward and to deserve it are all one. Therefore according to this
translation, which with the Papists is the only authentical text of
Scripture, the Apostle teaches, that the sufferings of this life deserve not
the life of glory. Neither is it material, whether we read worthy of it, or
worthy to it, that is equal in worth to it or worthy to be compared to it. For
if they be not worthy to it, they are not worthy of it, neither can they merit
or deserve it. The words in the original are (...) not worthy to the glory, or
not worthy to be compared to it. Thus Prove. 3. 15. where the Greek reads
(...) no precious thing is worthy of wisdom, the Latin has non valent
comparari, they may not be compared with it; according to the hebrew. So Eccl.
26. 20. alias 14. (...) lat* omnis autem ponderatio non est digna continentis
animae. No weight is worthy of her chaste mind, that is, nothing of worth is
equal, ot to be compared in worth to it. The meaning then of the words is
this. I resolve says the Apostle (the Greek is (...), which signifies, that
when a man has cast his accounts, and well weighed the matter, he conclude^h,
resolves, determines, as Romans 3. 28. and 6. 11.) (...) of this present time
(that is, the sufferings, which the godly sustain (...) are not worthy of, (so
the word (...) throughout the New Testament does fignifie) or not worthy to be
compared, or comparable, or equal in worth to the glory which shall be
revealed in us or upon us.

. XIX. In the former sense these words are a direct and absolute The former
sense contradicts merit of condignity.
denial of the merit of condignity. For if the passions of this life are not
worthy of eternal life, then much less the actions of this life. For by the
sufferings of this time Martyrdom is chiefly meant. Now the Papists teach,
that the merit of a Martyr is greater than of a Confessor: that by it as
Infants by Baptism, those which suffer though not before baptized are purged
from their sin, and are immediately translated into heaven. And yet of them
Saint Augustine says De Civit. D. l. 5 cap. 18.
nullo modo superbiant sancti Martyrs tanquam dignum aliquod pr^ illius
patriae p^rticipatione fecerint, ubi aeterna est and vera faelicitas. Let not
the holy Martyrs by any means be lifted up with pride, as though they have
done something for the participatio^ of that country where is eternal and
true felicity.

Bellarmine De justif. lib. 5. cap. 2. and. 3.
who tells us, that wheresoever in the new Testament there is mention of
worthiness, there merit is meant, is feign to ^lee from the signification of
unworthiness, to the second sense importing disproportion and inequality;
signifying, (though he does not very well expr^sse himself, when he says,
that the Apostle speaks of the substance of the works not of the absolute
proportion) that howsoever they be unequal, yet they are not unworthy of
eternal life. So that this inequality he understands not in respect of
worth, but in respect of length and greatness. Whereto I reply; first, if
(...) every where in the New Testament signifies worthy, and worthiness
implies merit as Bellarmine teaches, then (...) fignifieth non condigna, as
their own authentic translation reads, that is they are not worthy, which
is all one, as, as if it were said, they deserve not nor merit the future
glory. Oec^menius Oecumen in Romans 8.
upon the place says, (...) the Apostle shows that we are not able, either
to suffer or to confer any thing worthy the remnueration that is there.

Ambrose, Epist. 22.
The Apostle, that he might exhort us unto suffering, adds this reason,
because all things which we suffer are less and unworthy, for the pains
whereof there should be rendered so great a reward of future good things.

Eusebius Emissenus: Homit. ad Mo^ach. 3.
Ergo totis licet and animae and corporis laboribus, desudemus, totis licet
obedientiae viribus exerceamur, nihil ^amen condignum merito pro coelestibus
compensare and afferre valebimus. Non valent vi^ae pr^ sentis obsequia ^terna
vitae gaudiis comparari. Lassescant licet membra vigiliis, pallescant licet ora
jej^niis non erunt tamen condignae passiones hujus temporis ad futura^ gloriam,
etc.

Athanasius, In vita Sancti Antonii cited by Bellarmine, De justif. l. 5. c. 14.
ne^ (...) orbi renunciantes dignum aliquod habitaculis possumus compensare
c^lestibus.

Augustine, In Psalm. 93.
Quanto labor dign^ est requies, quae non habet finem? Si verum vis comparare
and verum judicare, aterna requies ^terno labor rect^ emitur. See the
testimony of Gregory In Psalm. 7. poe^it. verse. ^.
cited. 2. of this chapter. Secondly, if they be unequal, if there be a
great, or rather infinite disproportion between our short and light
asflictions, and the eternal superexcellent weight of glory, then cannot our
sufferings merit eternal life. For between the merit and the reward there
must be some proportion of equality. Wherefore this text, as in the former
sense it directly contradicts the merit of condignity; so in the latter it
does disprove it by necessary consequence. For condign merits are equal to
the ^ward: the sufferings of this life are not equal to the future glory,
therefore they do not merit eternal life. Popish exceptions.


. XX. Neither will it help our Rhemists, nor ^ellarmine himself, to salve
their error with blasphemy. The note of the Rhemists upon the word condign is
this. Our adversaries gro^nd hereon, that the works or sufferings of this life
be not meritorious or worthy of life ever lasting: where the Apostle says no
such thing: no more than he says, that Christ's passions be not meritorious of
his glory -- he expresses only, that the very afflictions of their own
nature which ^e suffer with or for him, ^e but sh^rt, momenta^y, and of no
account in comparison of the recompense which we shall have in ^eaven. No more
indeed were Christ's pai^es of their (...) nature compared to his glory any whit
comparable: yet they were ^eritorious, (...) worthy of heaven and so be ours.
Where they seem to put no difference between^ the Head and his members. If
Christ did merit his glory by his short fufferings, then do we: if we do
not, then not he. But their wisdoms should have considered the obedience of
Christ was the obedience of God, that is, of him who was and is God; that the
sufferings which he did sustain were the sufferings of God, the blood which
he shed for us was the blood of God, Act. 20. 28. and therefore of infinite and
all sufficient value and merit, both to satisfy for our sins, and to merit
for us eternal life. Whereas our obedience and our sufferings, are the
sufferings and obedience of sinful men. And therefore if they will not still
be Antichristians, they must acknowledge, that to satisf^e sor the punishment
of hell, and to merit heaven are privileges and prerogatives peculiar to Christ
our head, whose sufferings and obedience, by reason of the dignity of his
person, are of infinite value and worth, not to satisfy or merit for himself
(sor that needed not, seeing the man Christ by reason of the hypostaticall
union was in the days of his flesh, as the Papists themselves teach, both
Viator and Comprehensor, enjoying from the first instant of his conception the
beatificall vision) but for the world, and for more worlds, if there were more.
But here Bellarmine does instance first, that as the passion of Christ was much
shorter than the pains of hell, yet because of the dignity of the person which
suffered, was most worthy to be esteemed a full satisfaction: so, though the
passions of this time be short, and that glory be eternal, notwithstanding
between these sufferings, and that glory, there is a proportion, by reason of
the dignity of charity whence they proceed. And this seems to have been the
meaning of Bellarmines distinction, that the Apostle denies the sufferings of
this life to be equal to the future glory, in respect of the substance of the
work, and considered in themselves as they are humane, as they are short and
light, they are no way equal to the future glory: yet as they are, as it were,
divine, proceeding from the divine grace of charity, they have an equal, and
as he calls it, an absolute proportion. Thus they make an idol of charity:
as if it being not only finite, but also unperfect, and but begun, were of
sufficient worth and dignity to merit an infinite reward. And yet the Apostle
speaking of the sufferings of the faithful who as it was said in the verses
going before are the sons and heirs of God, endued with the Spirit, yea, of
Martyrs who are endued with a great measure of charity, denies them to be
condign to the glory which shall be revealed.

His second instance is by comparison taken from the delights of sin, which are
incomparably less, than the torments of hell: yet because of the contempt of
God, they are worthy to be punished with those torments. Reply. Whatsoever the
delights of sin be, the guilt of sin is infinite, and cannot be taken away
but by an infinite satisfaction.

The third instance is of an unlike s^militude, of seed compared to the Tree
(as though the tree were merited by the seed) between which though very
unequal there is a proportion. Reply. Between all things that are finite
there may be a proportion, though not an equal proportion, which must be
between the merit and the reward: between that which is finite, and that which
is infinite, there is no proportion at all.

. XXI. But letting pass all other proofs, Bellarmine will needs Bellarmines
objection out of 2 Cor. 5. 17.
make the Apostle contradict himself; as if elsewhere he did teach, that the
sufferings of this present time are worthy or meritorious of eternal glory.
Because he says, 2 Cor. 4. 17. For that our tribulation, which presently is
momentany and light, works above measure exceedingly an eternal weight of
glory in us. Works, says he, non physice sed moraliter, id est, non
efficienter sed meritorie, not naturally, but morally, that is, not
efficiently, but meritoriously, et per hoc dignas esse passiones hujus
temporis, quibus gloria illajusto judicio tribuatur, and consequently, that the
sufferings of this time are worthy, that in just judgment that glory should be
given unto them: which is the direct contradiction of this place. But this
allegation I fully answered Lib. 7. cap. 5.. 7.
before, it being his fifth testimony, whereby he would prove good works to be
necessary to salvation by the necessity of efficiencie. Here it shall be
sufficient to show, that merit cannot hence be proved. Yea but, says he,
afflictions are said to work this weight of glory: which must not be
understood physically, that is efficiently; but morally that is meritoriously:
whereto I reply, that a meritorious cause is an efficient cause: and that which
works meritoriously works efficiently, though not contrariwise. And
therefore although from hence sufficiency were proved, yet merit is not. For I
pray, what is here said to work? Tribulation? But though tribulation work, as
it and all things else do work together for the good of Gods children, Romans
8. 28. yet does tribulation merit? Then is it a meritorious thing to be
afflicted, and punished. For affliction is malum poenae the evil of punishment
merited by sin. Does affliction then work salvation? Surely no more then the
afflicter, who is the instrument of our affliction, and seeks our
destruction. Does not the afflicter merit? no more does the affliction there
may be some efficiency, both in the afflicter and in the affliction, but means
there can be none in either. The efficiency may be showed thus. Affliction
(...) Romans 5. 4. Iam. 1. 3.
works patience, not meritoriously, but by another kind of efficiencie, and
that not of it self, and in it own nature, which being evil moves rather
Job 1. 11. 2. 5.
to impatience: but by accident, and occasionally, the holy Ghost using it as a
means to exercise our faith and to work patience in us, and therefore in
this, and such like places, 2 Cor. 4. 17. Romans 5. 3. Iam. 1. 3. Romans 4. 15.
the word (...) signifie^h no more than occasioneth. Patience works (...)
probation, viz. declarative: for bearing afflictions patiently a man is known
to be (...) Iam. 1. 12. that is a sound and approved Christian: (...) or
probation works efficiently or produces hope; and in spe in hope, though not
in re, we are saved. This working therefore is not by way of merit.

But what manner of thing is that, which is here said to work? and what manner
of thing is that, which is here said to be wrought? that which works is
(...)* the momentany lightness of our affliction, the thing wrought is (...)
which is more emphaticall and hyperbolicall to signify the infinitenes of that
glory, than I am able to express. There being then no proportion betwixt the
momentany lightness of affliction, and the more than hyperbolicall exceedingly
exceeding weight of glory eternal, how can th^re be merit? To that which has
been said concerning this place, Romans 8. 18. three other considerations may be
added; the two former out of Hierome, In (...).
id est, that a man could not suffer any thing worthy the eternal glory,
though it were such as this present life is. The other is that all he can
suffer is not more, but a great deal less, than by his sin he has
deserved. And how then can he by the sufferings of this life, whereby he is not
able to ^atisfie for his sin, deserve eternal life? The third out of
Bernard, In annunciat. sermon. 1.
we do know, says he, that the sufferings of this time, are not worthy to the
future glory, nec si unas omnis sustineat, No, that they are not, though one
man should sustain them all, which though it be a very great, yet is a very
true amplification, that if one man should bear all the afflictions of all men
in this world, yet his afflictions of this time would not be worthy of the
glory that shall be revealed. Such amplifications are used no less truly by
Chrysostom and Anselm. Chrysostom De compunct. adstolochium. lib. 157.
says, (...), etc. If we should dye ten thousand deaths, and if we should
show forth al virtue, yet could we not recompense the least part of those
honors that God has already bestowed upon us. And if we cannot by all such
means be answearable to God for his favors ^ouchsafed in this world, by what
means might we hope to merit eternal life in the world to come? If a man
should serve God most devoutly De mensurat. crucis. B. Nascitur
a thousand years, yet he should not condignely merit to be in the kingdom
of heaven half a day, says Anselme.

. XXII. In the sixth place Bellarmine alleges three testimonies Three
Testimonies alleged by Bellarmine for us.
as objected by us, viz. Phil. 3. 7, 8, 9. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. Tit. 3. 5, 7. The
first we do not use to produce against merit of salvation, but against
justification by inherent righteousness, and was the sixth Testimony of ours,
which Bellarmine endeavored to answer, as he does here. See Lib. 7. Cap. 3..
15. The second was the fourth Testimony, which he took upon him to answer. See
my reply Lib. 7. Cap. 3.. 13. The third was the fifth Testimony, of which see
Lib. 7. Cap. 3.. 14. But though we do not allege the first against merit of
works; yet by The first, Phil. 3. 8, 9.
by consequent it does disprove it. For if works do not concur to
justification as the matter thereof, then can they not be the merit of
salvation, as has been said. Secondly, if in the question of justification,
which concerns our title to Salvation, they are to be accounted as things of
no worth, yea as loss, then are they not meritorious of eternal life. And
whereas Bellarmine challenges us to allege any one Father, that understands
Paul to speak of works done after grace: I alleged before Saint Chrysostom
upon the place, who understands the Apostle as speaking of all, (...), he
said all, both old and new, both past and present, and that I confirmed by
reason. And when he says, that Augustine calls the righteousness of the
faithful Eminentissimam, it is apparent, that he speaks not of that, which
we have by our obedience performed to the Law, but of that most eminent
righteousness, which we have by faith. The other two places exclude works
from being any causes, as well of Salvation as of justification. And it is
plain, that the Apostle speaks of salvation, and of all the degrees thereof,
that it is wholly to be ascribed to the grace of God, and not our worthiness.
Ephesians. 2. ^, 9. Tit. 3. 5.
His words in the former, By grace you are saved through faith, no^ of works.
The latter: not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according
to his mercy he saved us. Whence arises this argument. If by our merits we
are saved, then by works: but not by our works, therefore not by merits. Or
thus, If not by works we are saved, because we are saved by grace, then much
less are we saved by our own merits.

CAP. III. A new supply of reasons produced against merits, and maintained
against Bellarmines cavills.
. I.

Our first reason. The true Doctrine of justification Reason 1. the true
doctrine takes away all cause of boasting.
and Salvation takes from us all cause of boasting in our selves, that he 1
Cor. 1. 31.
which glories may glory in the Lord: and contrariwise, that which does not
take away all cause of boasting in our selves, is not the true Doctrine:

The Doctrine of justification by faith without works, and of salvation by
Gods free grace without our merit takes from us all cause of our boasting in
our selves: but the Doctrine of justification by works, and of salvation by
our own merits, does not take away all cause of boasting in our selves. Both
proved Romans 3. 27. and 4. 2. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9.

The effect of Bellarmines answer is; that they, who plead their own merits,
as proceeding from grace, do^ not glory i^ themselves, but in the Lord.

Reply, First, so long as they be ours, though given of God, as all other good
things are, we are apt to glory in them, as appears by the Pharisee, who
boasts Luke 18. 11.
of his merits, though he acknowledges, that he received them from God; and
therefore renders thanks for them. Secondly, the pleading of merit, is it
self a proud boasting, Matthew. 20. 12. Thirdly, the Papists plead merit as
proceeding from their own free will, which they require as a necessary
condition of merit. Fourthly, If the good work proceed merely from Gods
grace, then can we not by it merit any thing of God. But the Papists teach,
that by it they merit of God: and consequently deny it, so far forth as it
meriteth, to proceed from the grace of God, and therefore when they plead
merit, they glory in themselves, rather than in the Lord. Our second reason,
that their doctrine derogateth from the merit of Christ.


. II. Our second reason: That doctrine, which derogateth from the infinite and
all-sufficient merit of Christ, is to be renounced as false and Antichristian.

The Popish doctrine of merits, viz. that we are to be saved by our own
merits, and that the faithful by their own works do truly and condignely
merit eternal life, derogateth from the infinite and all-sufficient merit of
Christ. Therefore it is false and Antichristian. The assumption they deny; yea,
though indeed they do derogate from the merit of Christ, yet they denounce
Conc. Trident. sess. 6. can. 33.
anathema against them that shall say so. But we not only say it, but prove it.
For first; If Christ has already most sufficiently and fully merited heaven
for us, then our merits are needless: or if our merits be needful, as they
teach, then are not Christ's sufficient for us; which is no better than
blasphemy.

Secondly, they who teach, that Christ has not merited for all that believe,
and as soon as they truly believe, the right of eternal life, do greatly
derogate from the merit of Christ. For the Scriptures do teach, that Christ
has so merited the right of eternal life to all the faithful, that by him
they have Ioh. 5. 24. and 6. 47. 1 Ioh. 5. 12, 13.
already eternal life, being already translated from death to life.

But they who teach, that the faithful are to merit the right of eternal life
by their own good Works, do in effect teach, that CHRIST has not merited it
to the faithful.

Therefore they who teach that the faithful are to merit the right of eternal
life by their own good works, do greatly derogate from the merit of Christ.

This assumption may thus be demonstrated: That which a man has already, he
needs not to merit. For to merit is to obtain by desert that right which a
man has not yet. Nullus meret^r, says Th. 1. q. 62. art. 4. c.
Thomas, quod ^am habet, and again T^. part. 3. q. 19. art. 3. c.
meritum non est nisi ejus quod nond^m habetur. Therefore the faithful, if
they have already right to Gods kingdom, they need not merit it; or if they
must merit, then have they not as yet that right by Christ, but must purchase
it by their own deserts, which is greatly to derogate from the merits of
Christ. But the faithful before they produce any good works have right to Gods
kingdom. N^m hoc ips^, says Bellarmine, De justif l. 5. c. 14. S. quinta
rati^.
quod incipi^ esse fili^ Dei, (...) jus habere ad hareditatem falicitatis
^ternae, Romans 8. 17. G^l. 4. 7. (...) ^utem esse filii Dei, ^ntequam incipi^mus
been operari -- -- Igitur jus habemu^ ad aternam bareditatem per gratiam (...),
(...) (...) been operari. For in that very respect that we b^ginne to be the
sons of God, we begin to have right to the inheritance of the eternal
felici^y, Romans 8. G^l. 4. Now we begin to be the sons of God before we
begin to bring forth good works. Mer^it igitur Christus (says he) Christ
therefore merited the inheritance it self, whiles he merited the grace of
adoption: and again, De justif lib. 5. cap. 17.
unto him who is the Son of God by grace, the inheritance is due by the right
of adoption before all works. In which place Bellarmine teaches another point
of doctrine, whereby is excluded the merit of good works. Lib. 5. cap. 17..
(...).
Ex eo quod aliquis, says he, est filius Dei per gratiam, meretur ex condigno
haereditatem vitae aeternae, sine alio pacto, sed merito personae, non merito
operis. By this that any man is the son of God by grace, he does merit
condignely the inheritance of everlasting life, without any other covenant (for
if sons, then heirs) but he does merit it by the merit of his person, not
by the merit of his work, what needs then the child of God bring forth good
works with purpose to merit heaven by them, seeing before he produces any
good works, he has right unto the kingdom of heaven by the merit of his
person, in that he is the Son of God? Why forsoooth, as it is an
inheritance, he meriteth it by the merit of his person; but as it is a
mercenary reward or stipend or wages he must earne it by the merit of his
works, which is absurd, for if it be a free gift intended in our election
without any relation to our desert, a free inheritance purchased for us by
Christ, and freely promised to all that believe, and free reward of our
obedience, which is therefore by Augustine and others called Gratia, because it
is freely given, it cannot without absurdity be made the mercenary reward or
wages of hired servants.

Thirdly, to attribute that honor to every member of the body, which is
peculiar to Christ alone the Head, is to derogate from the honor of Christ our
Head.

But to merit eternal life is an honor peculiar to Christ alone our Head. For
eternal life in heaven being of infinite worth, as being the eternal fruition
of God who is infinite, cannot be condignely merited, but by that which is of
infinite value and price. Such are the merits of Christ and of him alone: such
neither ours, nor any mere creatures are, or can be. For the infinite merit of
eternal life depends on the infiniteness of the person who meriteth it:
such an one is Christ, such are none of his members. Therefore to Christ alone
it belongs to merit heaven for his members: and not to his members; who are
not to merit, but by faith to apprehend the merit of their Head. Fourthly, that
which takes from Christ the glory of being the only meritorious cause of
salvation, does grea^ly detract from the al-sufficiency of Christ's merits.

The Popish doctrine concerning the merit of works takes from Christ the
glory of being the only meritorious cause of our salvation: Therefore it does
greatly derogate from the all-sufficient merit of Christ.

Fifthly, they who ascribe the condign merit of heaven to their own good
works, and to salve the matter do feign, that Christ has merited for their
good works, that they may condignely merit heaven: do indeed rob Christ of
the honor of meriting for us eternal life, and do arrogate it unto
themselves. Thus do the Papists, who ascribe the condign merit of heaven to
their own works, and to bleare the eyes of the simple, they feign, that Christ
merited for our works, that they might be meritorious of eternal life: for
neither by the Scriptures, nor Fathers, nor any sound reason, do they so much
as go about to prove this fiction, this novelty. Christ did not save us to
make us our own Saviors; but in his own person, and as the Apostle speaks
(...) Heb. 1. 3.
by himself he performed the work of our redemption and the merit of our
salvation.

Object. 1. But you will say, did Christ merit for us, that we should be idle?
I answer, we are the Workmanship of God created unto good works, which God
has preordained that we should walk in them; not to merit by them, but to
glorify God by them, to testify our thankfulness, and to make our calling
and el^ction sure, and for many other reasons, which I delivered, when I proved
the necessity of good works.

Object. 2. It is not fit that Christ's merits should be applied to men without
works.

Answ. The merits of Christ are applied to us, that is, we are justified by
them without works, as the Apostle teaches; howbeit in them that are
justified good works do follow, but not as causes of justification, or as
merits of salvation.

Object. 3. But it is necessary we should be like unto Christ.

Answ. We must be like to him in the graces of sanctification, which we
receive from his fullness, even grace for grace, Romans 8. 29. 1 Io^n 3. 3. 1
Pet. 1. 16. But we cannot be like unto him in office of Mediation, or in the
power of meriting, which is proper to the Head. The exceptions of the Papists
against this argument.


. III. This argument, that the doctrine of merits is derogatory to the
all-sufficient merits of our only Savior, is worthy to be insisted upon, and
defended against all exceptions and cavils of the Papists; which indeed are
many, but may be reduced to these three heads: for either they serve to show,
that their doctrine does not derogate from Christ's merits: or that their
doctrine sets forth the glory of Christ's merit, no less than ours: or that
we by denying their doctrine do extenuate (such is their impudency) the merit
of Christ.

To the first purpose, De justif lib. 5. cap. 5. respondeo ad oct^vum
argumentum. Bellarmines first evasion.
Bellarmine has four evasions. The first, that The merits of just men are not
opposite to the merits of Christ, but spring from them. And what commendation
soever our merits have, that wholly redoundeth to the praise of Christ's merit.
For he is the Vine, we are the branches. And as a branch cannot bring forth
fruit, unless it abide in the vine; even so we without Christ can do nothing.
And as never any man was so unwise as to say, that the fruitefulnesse of the
branches detracteth from the glory of the Vine: so no man, that is not a very
fool would say, that it is a derogation from the glory of Christ, if his
servants by his Grace, by his Spirit, by faith and charity inspired from him,
bring forth good works, which are so truly just, that unto them is due from
the just Judge a crown of Justice.

Repl. To which answer I assent in some particulars. First, that it is indeed
a great honor to Christ, if his members do bring forth much fruit, John 15.
8. As contrariwise, it is a great dishonor to him, when any of his members
defile themselves with any crime, 1 Cor. 6. 15. Secondly, that having union
with Christ, as his members, we have also communion with him, both in his
merits to our justification and salvation; and also in the virtue of his death
to mortify sin in us, and of his resurrection to raise us unto newness of
life. By influence of which virtue from Christ our Head the holy Spirit
enableth us to bring forth the fruits of good works. But that these good
works, though wrought by the Spirit, though proceeding from faith and charity,
though acceptable to God in Christ, though graciously rewarded by him, are so
perfect and of such value, that they should be either satisfactory to Gods
justice, or meritorious of eternal life, that we utterly deny; these being
prerogatives peculiar to our Head, who only has both satisfied the justice of
God, and also merited heaven for us: and that to this end, that neither
satisfaction should be required of us for our sins (for which we cannot
satisfy, but by eternal punishment) nor merit of eternal life expected from
us, which cannot be merited but by a price of infinite value. For if there be
need of either, then either Christ has not fully satisfied, or not
sufficiently merited for us. And as it is a certain truth, that Christ did
not to this end satisfy for us, that we should satisfy, which to us is
impossible, but that we should be freed from the necessity of satisfying Gods
justice, as being already satisfied: so it is no less true, that Christ did
not to that end merit heaven for us, that we should merit it, which to us is
impossible; but that we should be freed from the necessity of meriting it,
which Christ has al-sufficiently merited, and should rely wholly and only on
the satisfaction and merit of Christ.

If they say, that Christ has merited for us those graces and works by which
we are to merit heaven: I demand, whether Christ himself did merit heaven for
us or not? If so, then need not our merits. If not, then do they not only
part stakes with Christ, but assume the greater merit, which is of glory, to
themselves and leave the less, which is of grace, to Christ; and that not
entire neither. For the obtaininig of righteousness, as they do not wholly
ascribe to their own free will, so neither to Gods grace; but partly to God
offering grace, and partly to their own free will, which willingly accepts
of grace, when it might refuse it. And this willingness (whatsoever they
pretend to the contrary) is in mine opinion the very root from whence their
conceipted merit does spring.

. IV. His second evasion, That merit of men are required, not beca^se
Bellarmines second evasion.
of the insufficiency, but because of the great efficacy of Christ's merits;
which merited with God, not only that we sh^ld obtain salvation, but that
we should obtain it by our own proper merits: or which is all one, that they
merited not only eternal salvation for us, but also the virtue or power of
meriting.

Repl. This answer is nothing but a mee^e begging of the question; taking for
granted, that which we utte^y deny, and none of them shall ever be able to
prove, that Christ merited for us, that we our selves should merit eternal
life.

For first, the power of meriting heaven at the hands of God is Christ's
peculiar: neither can any mere man, no not in the state of innocence, nor any
Angel, not any mere creature merit any reward at the hands of God: because
when they have done all, they have done but their duty. Much less can we,
who never do all, and that which we do is stained with the flesh, and is
mingled with manifold transgressions, if not of commission, from which none are
free, yet at least of omission.

Secondly, that Christ died for our sins to free us from hell; and that he
in his own person performed all obedience both Romans 5. 9, 16.
passive and active, that thereby we might be justified and saved, we read in
the Scriptures. But that he dyed for our good works to make them meritorious,
or that he merited for us the power of meriting heaven, which power is proper
to himself alone, and presupposes infiniteness of merit and worth, we read
not. The similitude which Bellarmine uses of the Sun, whereby God does
illuminate the world, and of other secondary causes, which God does use as
means whereby to work (which argue not Gods inability but his omnipotency in
giving such power to his creatures) to prove, that God his saving us by our
own merits, does not argue the insufficiency of Christ's merit, but the
sufficiency in giving such power to our merits, is as mere a begging of the
question as the former: taking for granted, that as God does enlighten the
world by the Sun, etc. (which all men know by experience) so he does save us
by our own merits: when as the Scriptures in plain terms deny us to be
saved by our works, but wholly and only by the merits of Christ. Besides, the
similitude is altogether unlike. For God does not illuminate the inferior
world by himself, but by the Sun, nor perform those other actions by
himself immediately, for which he has ordained secondary causes, as his
instruments, working ordinarily by means. But Christ by himself Act. 20. 2^.
Gal. 1. 4. 2. 20. Ephesians 5. 2. 1 Timothy 2. 6. Tit. 2. 14. Heb. 1. 3. 7. 27. 9. 14.
10. 14. 1 Pet. 2. 24. Apoc. 1. 5, 6.
has merited for us, giving the virtue and power of meriting to nothing out of
himself.

. V. His third Evas^on, That they do not part the glory between Christ and
themselves, beca^se they acknowledge their merits to be the gifts of God: and
that there is no good thing in themselves, which is theirs, and not The third
evasion that they do not part stake: with Christ.
Gods, from whose grace the force of merit depends. Which answer altogether
takes from our works the power of meriting with God. For how can we merit of
God by that which is his? But indeed this evasion, which here is used to serve
the present turn, is not suitable with the Popish doctrine, which teaches men
to part stakes with God, as I have said. First, in respect of grace, the
efficacy whereof they divide between God and their own free will. Secondly,
in respect of their justification, for the first they ascribe after a sort to
grace, the second which is increase of justice, to their own merit. Thirdly,
in respect of goo^ works, which as they be wholly Gods, so be they wholly
their own, as Bellarmine here says.

. VI. His fourth Evasion, That though we be saved by our own merits; yet we
are no less beholden unto Christ, than if we were saved without them, but
rather more. Because we are not only saved by his grace, but are also by it
saved after a most noble and ^onourable manner, that is to say, by our own
merits, which he has merited for us, that we by them might merit eternal
life. As if he should say, Christ has saved us, that is, has merited grace
and good works for us, that we by them may become our own Saviors. This
sounds well for man's praise, who would feign have a share in his own
salvation. But it becomes u^ to say, Psalm. 115. 1.
Not unto us, O Lord, not unto us, but to thy name give the praise. For what
glory we arrogate to our selves, we derogate from God, who will not give his
glory to another. If God is to have all the glory, then are we to have none.
If we take any part to our pEsay 42. 8.
selves, we do not ascribe it wholly to God. It is very true, that we are
beholden and bound to Christ, not only for salvation it self, but also for
those graces and good works unto which eternal life is rendered, as a free
reward. But the more gifts and graces we receive from Christ; the more we owe
unto him, the less we can merit of him. If we call his graces our merits; and
his gift and free reward our deserved hire, as the Papists do, then do we
challenge unto our selves the praise, both of the one, and of the other. But if
Christ in his own person and by himself has merited for us both eternal
life it self, and those things also unto which it is promised, as a free
reward: With what face can we ascribe it to our own merits? Or if we do
ascribe it to our own merits, though but in part, how do we not part stakes
with God.

. VII. And whereas he says, it is a most honorable way to be Bellarm. that
we are saved by our own merits, because that is a more honorable way.
saved by our own merits: I ask, whether more honorable to God, or to us? If
to us; the Scripture teaches us to strippe our selves of all honor in the
matter of our salvation, and to ascribe all honor and glory to God. It were
indeed more honorable for man to need no Savior, than being utterly lost in
himself to be saved by another. It were more honorable for man to be free
from all sin, and to be endued with most perfect righteousness, and if it
were possible to merit his own salvation; than being by sin fallen into the
state of damnation, to need a Savior. But now man having by his apostasy from
God, lost that honorable estate wherein he was created, and fallen into a
state of misery: his glory, wherein he is now to rejoice, is, that God (who
gave no Redeemer to the Angels that fell) gave his only begotten Son to
redeem him: his merit, as Gods mercy: his honor, that of a child of Satan,
and of a firebrand of hell, he is by Christ made the Son of God, and heir
of eternal life. And for Gods glory, it is not to be doubted, but that it was
most honorable to God for the illustration of the glory both of his mercy and
also of his justice, that man being fallen should be saved by the merits of
Christ: that being redeemed and justified, he should still be subject both to
inward infirmities and corruptions, and also to outward temptations, that in
our weakness his strength might appear, that we should not trust to our own
merits, or boast in our own worthiness, but should rely wholly on the mercies
of God and merits of Christ; ascribing the whole glory of our salvation
thereunto, and not to our own merits, who can deserve nothing but punishment
at the hands of God, if he should enter into judgment with us. And these were
Bellarmines Evasions.

. VIII. Others say, that their doctrine of merits nothing derogateth The
evasions of other Papists. First, that it is no less honor to Christ, to give
us where with to pay our debts, than himself to pay them for us.
from the merits of Christ, there being no great difference (as they conceive)
betwe^ne our doctrine who teach that Christ our Savior did himself and in his
own person both pay our debt and purchase heaven for us; and theirs, who hold,
that Christ indeed paid our debt, but to purchase heaven he himself did not
lay down the price, but did as it were put money into our purses, whereby we
might purchase and merit the same for our selves. But as the payment of our
debt requires a ransom of infinite value: so the purchase of heaven is not to
be procured at a less price. Christ therefore gave himself to be ^ Tim. 2. 6.
(...), a full price of Redemption for us, not only by Heb. 1. 3.
himself purging our sins and paying our debt by satisfying the penalty of
the Law: but also by giving a s^fficient price, which is his merit, to purchase
the heavenly inheritance for us. The benefit of this his merit, Christ applies
and communicates to all that truly believe in him: but the power of meriting
is not communicable to the members who are mere creatures, but is peculiar to
our head, who is both perfect man and perfect God also. And therefore no
obedience whether active or passive of any, but of his person only is
meritorious.

. IX. The more impudent is the recrimination of our English Fishers
recrimination that we derogat^ from the merits of Christ.
Jesuits, who are not ashamed to affirm, that we, who use justly to censure
them for derogating from the merits of Christ, that we, I say, extenuate the
merit of Christ, in denying that he m^rited for our good works that they
should condignely merit eternal life, and that therein we err fundamentally.
The impudency whereof is much the greater, because they are not able to allege
any Text of Scripture, or testimony of any of the ancient Fathers, testifying
that Christ did merit for us the power of meriting. For it was not the purpose
of our Savior to communicate that power to his members, which is a peculiar
prerogative of the Head: neither was it his meaning to save us to that end,
that we should be our own Saviors. Neither is it credible, that he would
give us money, as it were, to enable us in our own persons either to pay our
debt, or to purchase our i^heritance, seeing himself in his own person has
paid the full price of our redemption, and by his own personal merits has
fully and al sufficiently purchased ^he heavenly inheritance for us. For to
what end should he give us wherewith to merit, when he himself has more than
sufficiently merited for us, so that no other merit needs. But if other
merits are required besides, how his is merit acknowledged all-sufficient?
Again if it had been Christ's purpose to give us wherewith to merit, then
would he have infused most perfect righteousness into us, which should not
have been stained with any sinfulness, neither should need remission or
indulgence But we are so far from having this power to merit heaven, that the
best of us had need to pray with David, Psalm 143. 2. Psalm. 130. 3, 4.
as being not more just than he, Enter not into judgment with thy servants O
Lord, etc. for if thou should mark what is amiss, who should stand? and
with the Apostles, as being not more holy than they, forgive us our trespasses,
etc. our chief righteousness in this life, consisting as Augustine De Civit.
D. l. 19. c. 27.
truly says in remission of sins, rather than in perfection of virtues.
Now, whiles we are sinners in our selves, as all are, we cannot merit any
thing but punishment at the hands of God: and whiles we deserve hell how can
we possibly merit heaven?

. X. These were the arguments which Bellarmine took upon him Our third reason.
to answer, but could not satisfy. Now we are to add some others. Our third
reason therefore is this: If we cannot merit so much as temporal blessings at
the hands of God, then much less eternal; But we cannot merit so much as
temporal blessings at Gods hands; and therefore much less eternal.

1. The assumption I prove thus, first by the confession of Jacob, Genesis 32. 10.
that he was less than the least of Gods mercies. Of David, concerning mankind
in general, Psalm. 8. 4. and concerning himself in particular, 2 Samuel 7. 18.
Secondly, if by all our labors and endeavors we are not able to merit of God
so much as a piece of bread, but must beg it at Gods hands, then can we not
merit eternal life of him. But the former is true, for therefore our Savior
has taught us to make this daily prayer, that God would give us day by day our
daily bread. To this purpose Saint Hierome In Romans 8. 18
says well, that a man could not suffer any thing worthy the heavenly glory,
though it were such as this present life is. But Chrys^stome De c^mpunct. ad
(...).
goes further, if we should dye ten thousand times, etc. as he was before.
Anastasius, Anastas. sin aita quaest. 135.
for what good things soever we do, we are not answerable to God (...), for
the air alone which we breathe In Psalm. 23. 5.
Basil: Those, which are esteemed retributions, are granted to men only for
the Lords bounty sake: for all the righteousness of mortal men do not match
the gifts already vouchfafed, much less those which are to come, which exceed
our thought. But most agreeable to our doctrine is that assertion of Greg^rius
In 1. ^ent. did. ^. q. ^ art 2.
Ariminensis, quod ^dum ae^erna vita, etc. that no act of man though proceeding
from never so great charity does condignely merit with God not only eternal
life, but not so much as any other reward whether eternal or temporal.

. XI. Our fourth reason: That which we attain unto by right of The fourth
reason, bec^ise we attain to eternal life as our inheritance by right of
adoption.
adoption, as our inheritance purchased by Christ, and prepared for us from the
beginning of the world without any respect to our merits, that we do not
obtain by our merits.

Unto eternal life we do attain by right of adoption, as our inheritance
purchased by Christ, and prepared for us from the beginning of the world, and
that without any respect of our merits.

Therefore we do not attain to eternal life by our merits.

The assumption is manifest: for therefore in many places of Scripture the
Kingdom of heaven is called our inheritance, Act. 20. 32. and 26. 18. Gal. 3.
18. Ephesians. 1. 14. 18. 5. 5. Col. 3. 24. and that an eternal and incorruptible
inheritance, Heb. 9. 15. 1 Pet. 1. 4. And of this kingdom the faithful are
heirs, Iam. ^. 5. For therefore are we adopted the sons of God that we may be
heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs of Christ, Romans 8. 17. Gal. 4. 7. and
to the same end are we justified by his grace, that we might according to hope
be made heirs of eternal life, Tit. 3. 7. Bellarmine himself has taught,
as we have De justif. l. 5. c. 17. sed quanquam.
heard, that we are entitled to the Kingdom of heaven jure adoptionis. And in
that De justif. l. 5. c 14.. quinta ratio.
we begin to be the sons of God, we begin ^o have right to the inheritance of
the eternal ^elicity, now we begin to be the sons of God, before we begin
to bring forth good works. And hereby appears the truth of the proposition:
for we have our right of adoption not by merit, but by the free grace of God,
who has predestined Ephesians. 1. 5. 6.
us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself, according to the
good pleasure of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace, wherein he
has made us accepted in the beloved. And this inheritance was prepared for us
from the beginning of the world, Mat. 25, 34.

If it be objected, that as it is called an inheritance, so also a reward, and
reward presupposes merit, for so the Council of Trent Sess. 6. cap. 16.
teaches, that eternal life is to be propounded to the godly, both as grace,
that is, a free gift promised by Christ, and as a reward duly to be rendered to
their merits according to Gods promise. I answer, that eternal life is no
such reward as presupposes merit, for it is a free reward, freely promised,
freely given. Neither can those things stand together, which the Council of
Trent has conjoined, that eternal life should both be gratia a free gift,
graciously promised and freely bestowed, and also a due wages to be rendered to
desert, neither if it be the reward of inheritance, as it is called Col. 3. 24.
which is freely bestowed on the sons of God, it cannot be a mercenary wages
which is due to hired servants.

. XII. Our fifth reason: If good works do^ merit eternal life, His fifth
reason because good works ar^ not causes ^f eternal life.
then are they causes of it, for merits be the causes of that which is merited.

But good works are not the cause of eternal life, therefore they do not
merit it. The assumption I prove, first, from that received testimony of
Degratia and lib. arb.
Bernard, that good works are via regni, non causa regnandi. Quid autem hac
conclusione firmius? says Epist. 19. 1109.
Cassander, who also says, that Thomas Bradwardin and diverse other Schoolmen
deny good works to be the cause of the eternal reward, and that some who
call them causes, do mean Causam sine qua non, which properly is no cause.

Secondly, true causes of salvation may be trusted in for the obtaining of
salvation.

Our good works are not to be trusted in for the obtaining of salvation.

Therefore they are not true causes thereof.

The proposition is Bellarmines: De justif. lib. 5. cap. 7. propos. 2.. posse a.
Licet confidere in omni vera causa.

The assumption also in effect is his. For if it be most safe, as he truly
says, Ibid. propos. 3.
by reason of the uncertainty of our own righteousness (which none of them
can be certain of without special revelation) and danger of vain glory, not
to trust in our own merits, but to repose ^ur whole affiance in the only mercy
and bountyof God: then are they fools who repose affiance in their own
works. And no doubt but they are fools who trust in their own heart, as
Solomon says, Prove. 28. 26. For as Adrian says, Adrian de Trajecto in 4. Sent.
who after was Pope, Our merits are like astaffe of reed which not only
breaks, when it is leaned upon, but also pierces the hand of him that
leans on it. To trust in a man's own righteousness^ is the property of a
proud Iustitiary and hypocrite, Ezec. 33. 13. Luke 18. 9. and of one that is
accursed, Ier. 17. 5.
because he removes his heart from God and puts his trust in man, that is
to say, h^mselfe: for as In vigilia natalis Domini, sermon. 5.
Bernard well faith for a man to trust in himself, Non fidei* sed per ^dem
est: nec confidentiae sed diffidentiae magis in semetipso habere fiduciam. But
the true and upright Christian, renouncing all confidence in his own
righteousness, as being a beggar in spirit, Matthew. 5. 3. rests wholly on the
mercies of God and merits of Christ, Psalm. 130. 3, 4. and 143. 2. Dan. 9. 18. 1
Cor. 4. 4. Phil. 3. 8, 9. according to the advice of our Savior, Luke 17. 10.

If it be objected, that the godly in many places of Scripture do allege
their own innocence and integrity as seeming to put some affiance therein* 2
King. 20. 3. Nehem. 5. 19. Psalm. 18. 21, 24. 2 Timothy 4. 7, 8. I answer, first,
it is one thing to place affiance in our good works as causes of our salvation,
as Bellarm. de justif. lib. 5. c. 7. Bona merita sunt vera salutis causa licet
autem confidere in (...) nivera causa.
merit-mongers use to do: another, from our good works as tokens and signs
of our election, vocation, justification, and as presages of our glorification,
to gather comfort, ass^rance and hope to our selves of our justification and
salvation, which the faithful use to do, and to that end are they commanded
to practice good works, that they make their calling and election sure, 2 P^t.
1. 10. This distinction is acknowledged by Lib. 5. cap. 7. Sciendum.
Bellarmine, Sciendum est, says he, aliud esse fid^ciam nasci ex (...), ali^d
fiduciam esse ponendam in meritis. It is one thing out of our good works to
gather assurance and affiance in God, which the faithful do, as they are
exhorted in the Scriptures, 2 Pet. 1. 10. Job 11. 15. Romans 5. 4. Probation
works hope, 1 Ioh. 3. 21. If our heart condemn us not, then have we
confidence toward God: and it is another thing to place affiance in our
merits, which none but proud Iustitiaries and Pharisaicall Hypocrites use to
do. Secondly, we must distinguish betwixt the innocence and justice of a man's
cause, and the innocence and justice of his person. For the same men in the
Scripture who for the justification of their persons desire the Lord Psalm 143.
2. and 130. 3. 4.
not to enter into judgment with them; for the justification of their cause
have not feared Psalm. 7. 3, 4, 8. Three other reasons.
to appeal to Gods judgment.

. XIII. Our sixth reason: those who cannot fully discharge their duty, much
less can they merit. For they that merit must do more than their duty. For
they that do but their duty (though they do all that is commanded) must
acknowledge Luke 17. 10.
themselves to be unprofitable servants. But if they fail in their duty and
come short of that which is commanded, then can they merit nothing but
punishment at the hands of God. But no mortal man is able fully to satisfy
his duty. Our duty is to abstain from all sin, yea to be (...) from all
sin, and to do the things commanded, to do all, and to continue in doing
all, and that in that manner and measure which the Law requires. But those
things no mortal man is able to do, as has been proved heretofore. So far
is every mortal man from meriting any thing, but punishment, at the hands of
God.

Our seventh reason. If good works do merit salvation, then we are saved by
them: but we are not saved by good works, Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. Tit. 3. 5. therefore
they do not merit salvation.

Eighthly, the last reason. The heavenly Canaan is a land of promise as the
earthly Canaan was: which the Lord gave to the Israelites not because of their
merits, Deuteronomy. 9. 5. Nor for the merit of their forefathers, Josh. 24. 2. but
because he loved them and that for no other cause, but because he loved them,
Deuteronomy. 7. 7, 8. In which love as he freely promised it, so in the same
unde^erved love he did freely bestow it. And yet he was just in giving it,
because he had promised it, Nehem. 9. 8. The same we are to conceive of the
heavenly Canaan, whereof the other was a Type, that it is a land of promise and
no^ of merit, freely promised and freely bestowed on the heirs of promise.

CAP. IIII. Testimonies of Fathers disproving merits, and first those which
Bellarmine has sought to answer, and then others.
. I.

TO the former testimonies and proofs, I will adjoyne the testimonies of
Fathers and other writers. And first those, which Bellarmine De justif. lib. 5.
cap. 6. Hilary.
has endeavored to answer, of which Hilarie In Psalm. 51.
is the first. Spes in misericordia Dei in s^culum, and in seculum seculi est.
Non enim illa ipsa justitiae opera sufficient ad perfect^ beatitudinis meritum,
nisi misericordia Dei, etiam in hac justi^ae voluntate, h^manarum demutationum
and motuum vitia non reputet: hinc illud Prophetae dictum est, melior est
misericordia tua super vitam -- In tantum misericordia Dei muneratur, ut
miserans justitia voluntatem aeternitatis quoque suae justum quemque tribuat
esse participem. His intendement is, that the hope of salvation is to be
placed in Gods mercy, which is better than our righteous life. For the works
of righteousness without Gods mercy in forgiving of sins will not suffice to
obtain the reward of blessedness, which the mercy of God, pitying our will of
righteousness, bestows on the just. But Bell^mine makes him speak what
pleases him, for to omit, that for sufficient, he reads Sufficerent,
Hilary, says he, does teach, that with our goodworkes are mingled certain
sins, which though they make not a man unjust, as being light and veni^ll,
yet they need pardon and mercy, because nothing that is defiled can enter into
the kingdom of heaven. Bellar^ines meaning is, that at the day of judgment,
the faithful shall need Gods mercy for the pardoning of venial sins, as
heretofore Ad object. 1. cap. 5.
^ee has taught. But there is no such matter in Hilary, neither is it true, as
I have showed Cap. 2..
before, that at the day of judgment the faithful shall need remission of
venial, or any other sins: neither does Hilary say, that the sins which
are forgiven by the mercy of God are light, and such as the Papists call
venial. Neither is it true, that there be any sins, which do not make them
sinners in whom they are; seeing Bellarmine here confesses that men are so
defiled by them, that they being not remitted, exclude them from heaven:
neither does he say with good merits are mingled sin^es, neither does he call
those works which are mingled with sins good merits, for that implies a
contradiction; but he says, they do not suffice to merit or obtain the
reward of blessedness, and therefore indeed denies the works of
righteousness to merit eternal life.

. II. The second is Basil: Mane^ sempitern^ requies illos, qui in hac Basil in
Psalm. 114. alias 11^.
vitalegitime certaverunt non ob eorum merita factorum, sed de munificentissimi
Dei gratia in quem sperarunt, which is a pregnant testimony. But Bellarm*
taking advantage at the Printers fault in the old Edition of Basil, leaving out
the word (...), which since has bin supplied; answereththat Chemnitius did not
rightly translate the words of Basil, for in the Greek neither the words Non
ob eorum merita, are found, nor the word Grati^. The words are these, (...).
There is propounded an eve^lasting ^est, to them who lawfully strive in this
life, not rendered according to the debt or due of works, but according (to the
grace) of the most bountiful God, in whom they have trusted: where the word
(...)* if it were not expressed, is of necessity to be understood, and the
rather, because he seems by allusion to invert the words of the Apostle, Romans
4 4. (...). For with Bellarmine, in stead of (...) to repeat (...), as if he
had said, according to the duty or debt of the most bountiful God, or great
giver, it is absurd, gift and debt being contrary. And also by (...) debt or
du^ty, to understand, as he does, measure which becomes the bounty of God,
that is much greater than is due to the works, is no less absurd. For neither
does (...) siignifie measure, neither is the word (...) repeated in the latter
clause, which signifies rendered, but (...) that is, exhibited, which
Bellarmine leaves out. Neither does he say (...), as Bellarmine absurdly
understands him to speak; for there is no debt or duty of God. Neither
would it hinder our cause if the word rendered were repeated in the latter
clause, for what is promised, is to be rendered. But in plain terms, Basil
says, that eternal rest to them that live well is not rendered (...),
according to the merit of their works, but (...) according to the grace of the
munifi^nt God, exhibited.

But his second Evasion is more gross, that Basil speaks of the reward as
rendered, not according to the merit of works which men have done by their own
strength, but such as are done by grace.

Repl* Basil plainly speaks of those who fought a good fight in this life
and have trusted in God, and says, that the eternal rest is laid up for them,
and that it is rendied not according to the merit of works, but given according
to the grace of God the great Giver. Neither does he speak of natural or
g^acelesse men, of whom he never dreamed, that the eternal rest is p^epared
for them; but of godly men, such as David was, whose wo^ds, Return unto thy
rest, O my soul, were the occasion of this speech. Besides, if the rew^rd be
rendered as Bellarmine says, Supra condignum* how is it merited ^x condign^? Or
if it be mer^ted ex condigno; how is it supra condignum?

. III. The third is Saint Augustines, out of whom h^ recites Augustin^
only three places, as ^ited by us, the firl^. In Psalm. 70. conc. 2.
(...) sunt, (...) Dei sunt. The sins are thine, the merits are Gods.
Supplicium tibi debetur, and cum praemium v^nerit, ^ua dona cor^abit, non
meri^a (...). Punishment is due to thee. And when the reward shall come, he
will crown his own gifts, not thy merits.

2. Pro De verbis Apostoli. sermon. 15
nihilo salvos facies illos: nihil invenies unde salves, and multum invenis
vnde damnes, thou will save them for nothing, thou find nothing for which to
save, and thou find much, for which to condemn.

3. Maluit dicere gratia Dei vita ^terna, ut intelligeremus, non pro meritis c
De gratia and lib. arb. cap. 9.
nostr is Deum nos ad aeternam vitam, sed pro sua miseratione perducere, he
chose rather to say, that life eternal is the grace of God; that we might
understand, that not for our merits, but for his own mercy he does bring us
unto eternal life. Which are most plain and pregnant testimonies. Bellarmine
answers in gross: wheresoever Augustine condemns merits, he speaks of
such merits, as be in us, from our selves, that is to say, without the grace of
God. And to this purpose he quoteth August. Epist. 105. ad Sixtum in two
places, and his Book de gratia and lib. arbitr. c. 6. 7. 8.

Reply, Augustine by merits understands good works: which he considers
either as going before grace, wrought by the strength of our own free will,
which against the Pelagians he denies t^ merit either grace or glory; or he
speaks of them as proceeding from grace, which he acknowledges to be
rewarded with eternal life. But these, though he call them merits, because
they are to be rewarded: yet every where he says, that the reward is given to
them not as to our merits deserving it, but as to the free gifts of God. And
therefore that the reward it self is called gratia both because it is freely
given, and because those works to which it is given, are wholly to be
ascribed to Gods grace: and consequently, that the Lord, when he rewards our
works with eternal life, does not reward them, as our merits, but as his own
gifts Than which what can be spoken more effectually against the merits of
condignity? For if our good works be not our own, as from our selves, how can
^hey merit of him whose gifts they are. If they were our own and from our
selves, and were also perfect (as they are not) then perhaps it might be said,
that when God rewards them, he rewards our merits: but not being from our
selves, but merely by his gift, when he rewards them he does not reward our
merits, but crown his own gifts. It is plain therefore, that whereas August.
considers good works two ways, either as our merits, or as Gods gifts; he
both constantly denies eternal life to be rendered unto them, as to our
merits, and also affirms, that it is given to them freely, as to the free
gifts of God. And this is proved out of those very places which Bellarmine
alleges, in the first place he says: Epist. 105.
Cum Deu^ coronat merita nostra, nihil aliud coronat quam muner a s^a. When God
does crown our merits (so he calls good works) he crowns nothing else,
but his own gifts, and in another place. In Psalm. 10^.
Ergo coronat te, quia dona sua coronat, non merita t^a, and again in the same
epistle he says, Epist. 105.
that howsowever eternal life is rendered to our good works, which he
therefore calls merits: yet because these good works or merits unto which it
is rendered are not from our selves, but from grace: it self therefore is
called grace, non ob aliud, nisi quia gratis datur, for no other cause, but
because it is freely given: nor for that it is not given to merits or good
works, but because they themselves are given, to which it is given. And again,
that eternal life is the reward of true righteousness; to which righteousness,
if it were from our selves, and were to be found in us, the reward should be
due as the stipend thereof: but being not from our selves, but from the grace
of God: therefore to us eternal life is grace as being the free reward of
grace; to which, as it is freely promised, so it is freely given. And the like
is to be said of the other places, some whereof I have before alleged as being
pregnant to our purpose. Wherein as in innumerable other places, Augustine does
not speak of the works of natural men, but of the works of the faithful
and regenerate proceeding from grace, to which, not as to merits, but as to the
free gifts of God eternal life is freely given. And it is apparent that he
speaks of the faithful, who are in the state of salvation, even then, when
they are to be saved De gratia lib. arb. cap. 9.
ut intelligeremus non pro meritis nostris Deum nos ad eternam vitam; sed pro
sua miseratione perducere.

And again De verb. Apostoli sermon. 15.
cum pr aemium venerit, sua dona coronabit, non merita tua. And again pro
nihilo salvos facies illos, nihil invenis unde salves, and multum invenis unde
damnes.

To these three I will out of very many places, which might be alleged out of
Augustine* against the condign merit of our works, add a few more.

4. For writing on those words, Psalm. 142 In Psalm. 142.
Propter nomen tuum Domine vivificabis me in justitia tua, spoken in the future
tence of a faithful and regenerate man, viz. the Author of that Psalm, in ^ua
justitia, says he, non in mea, non quia eg^ merui, sed quia tu miser eris: nam
si meum ostenderem meritum, nihil abs te mererer nisi supplicium. In thy
righteousness, not in mine, not because I have merited; but because thou have
mercy. For if I should show my merit, I should deserve of thee nothing but
punishment.

5. Again writing on those words of the 62. Psalm, In Psalm. 62.
Melior est misericordia tua super vi^as, he says, multa sunt vit^ humana: sed
Deus unicam vitam (...), and no^ illam dat nob^ q^asi propter merita nostr^,
sed propter misericordiam suam.

6. Si In Psalm 94.
vellet pro meritis ager^, non inveniret nisi quos damnaret.

7. Promisit In Psalm. 1 c 9.
enim b^minibus divinitatem, mortalibus immortalitatem, peccatorib^s (...),
abjectis glorificationem quicquid promisit indignis (...), ^t non quasi
operib^s merces promitteretur, sed gratia a nomine s^o gratis (...): quta and
hoc ip sum, quod just vivit, in quantum ^mo potest just viv^re, non meriti
^ani, sed beneficii est divini.

8. Psalm. 139.
Me^itis suis ni^il tribunt (just^) non tribuerat ^tum nisi misericordia (...)
(O De^s.)

9. No^ Tract. 3. in I^an.
pro merito quidem accipies vitam ater^am, sed tantum pro gratia.

10. Debita Epist. 105:
redditur poena damnato, indebita gratia liberato: ut nec ille se indig^ quer
atur, nec dignum se iste glorietur. --

Si autem gratia, utique nullis meritis reddita, sed gratuita bonitate donata.

12. And again, Gratia evacuatur, si non gratis donatur, sed meritis redditur.

. IV. In the fourth place he cites for us Prosper, by the halves, or Prosp. de
v^t. Gent l. 1. c. 17. alias. 5.
not so much: for in the beginning of that Chapter which Bellarmin^ cites, he
speaks of those, who having lived in wickedness are converted a little
before their end; and says this happens ut indubitanter agnoscas gratuita
esse Dei munera: and ^icut nulla sunt tam detestanda faeinora, quae possunt
gratiae arcere donum: ita nulla posse tam praeclara opera existere, quibus hoc
quod gratis tribuitur, per retributi^nis judicium debeatur. Therefore no debt
due to us from God, no merit in us: afterward he says, that those who were
sent into the vineyard at the eleventh hour, did represent those who are
called in the end of their life, and that the Lord did make them, who came at
the eleventh hour equal with those who wrought all day, non l^bori pretium
solvens, sed divitias bonitatis suae in e^s, quos sine operibus elegit,
^ffundens; ut etiam hi qui in multo labor sudarunt, nil amplius quam novissmi
acceperun^, intelligant, donum se gratiae, non operum accepisse mercedem: not
paying an hi^e to the labor, but pouring forth the riches of his bounty on
them, whom he chose without works: that they also who took great pains, and
received no more than the last, should understand, that they received a gift of
grace, and not the wages of their work. By the day-peny the equality of
eternal life is signified as Prosper teaches as Denario vit^ aeternae
significatur ^qualitas.
Bellarmine himself confesses. And therefore it is not rendered as an hire or
wages to men's labors, for then the reward should have been proportionable to
the labor, but as a gift of grace, which the Lord bestows according to his
good pleasure, Matthew. 20. 15.

He^e Bellarmines threed-bare answer, that Prosper denies eternal life to be
the wages of such works or merits as go before grace, but grants it to be
wages of those which proceed from grace, is not worth the refuting: for the
works to which the day-penney was given, were the works of the laborers,
which they performed after their calling. Unto which notwithstanding it was
given not as the price or hire of the labor, but as a gift of grace: for if
the reward was not the deserved wages of their works, but the free gift of
their Lord, then their works were not merits of their reward. But that Prosper
did not deny true merits which proceed from grace, Bellarmine says, it is
plain by the same place, where he says, Bona merita sequi in homine post
adeptam gratiam, non autem praecedere: I answer If he had said so, his
meaning had been the same with that which he learned of Augustine, that good
works do not go before, but follow grace. But indeed there is no such saying
of Prosper in that place.

. V. The fifth is Gregory the great: On those words of Job: Si Gr^g (...). lib.
9. cap. 14.
habuer^ quippiam justum, non (...), sed meum judicem depre^abor, (which it
self is an excellent testimony, against merits,) commenteth thus, Velut si
apertius fatea^ur dicens, and si ad ^pus virtutis excr^'vero, ad vitam non ex
meritis, sed ex venia convalesco: as if he should more plainly confess and
say, though I grow up to the work of virtue, yet to life I am enabled, not by
merits, but by pardon. To this, Bellarmine gives the same answer which he did
to A^gustine and Prosper, which is that one and the same bush whereby he
se^keth to stop all gapps, that he speaks of such merits as we have from
our selves, which neither are, nor can be any. But to this place this answer
cannot be applied, seeing Gregory speaks those words in the person of Job,
whose works proceeded from grace, he being the most gracious man that was then
upon the earth.

The same Gregory writing on the seventh Penitential Psalm. 143.
Psalm, speaks to this effect. If that felicity of Saints be mercy, and is
not acquired by merits, which he had noted before out of the Psalm, what then
shall become of that which is written, and thou rendrest to every man according
to his works? if it be rendered according to works, how shall it be esteemed
mercy? But it is one thing says he, to render according to works, another to
render for the works themselves. For in that it is said according to works,
the quality of works is meant, that whose works shall appear to be good, his
reward may be glorious. For to that blessed life wherein we live with God and
by God, no labor may be matched, no works compared: especially, seeing the
Apostle says, The passions of this time are not condign to the future glory.
Where he teaches these three things. First, that eternal life is not gotten
by merits, no not of Saints. Secondly, That it is not given for our works as
the meritorious cause, though according to our works. Thirdly, that our works
are not worthy of it, and therefore cannot condigne^y merit it.

. VI. The sixth and last is Bernard, out of whom he cites, as objected Bernard.
by us, four Testimonies. The first, de annunciat. sermon. 1. where is an
excellent passage against merits, out of which Bellarmine cites for us one
only sentence. But I will recite the whole place. Now as touching life
eternal, we know, that the passions of this time are not condign to the
future glory, though Nec si unus omnes sustin^at.
one man should sustain them all. Neither are the merits of men such, that
eternal life should be due to them by right, or that God should do some
injury, if he did not give it. For to omit, that all our merits are Gods
gifts, and so for them man is more a debtour to God, than God to man: what are
all merits to so great glory? Finally, who is better than the Prophet -- who
held it necessary to say unto God, Enter not into judgment with thy servant O
Lord: and a little after: when he had commended special faith (which the
Papists cannot abide) he ^aith, ipse peccata condonat, ipse donat merita, and
pramia nihilominus ispe redonat, he forgiveth our sins, he gives us merits
or good works, and he nevertheless gives us the rewards.

In which words are contained six good arguments against merit of condignity.

The first, If the passions of this life (even martyrdom it self) are not
condign or worthy to the future glory though one did bear them all, then much
less, are our actions or good works: But the passions of this time, though
one man should sustain them all, are not condign or worthy to the future
glory: therefore much less are our good works worthy of that glory.

Secondly, Condign merits are such that eternal life is due unto them by
right, insomuch as God should seem to do wrong if he did not bestow it, as
the Papists most presumptuously teach: But our good works are not such, as
Bernard here plainly testifies, therefore our good works are not condign
merits of eternal life.

Thirdly, Those things which be the gifts of God, do not merit of God, yea
they are so far from meriting at the hands of God, that they make men, who
have them, debtours to God, and not God to them. But our good works, which
some call merits, are all of them the gifts of God.

Fourthly, Between merits of condignity and the reward there is an equal
proportion: But what are all our good works, which they call merits, to so
great glory?

Fifthly, They who have condign merits, may boldly appear before the
judgment of God, and challenge their due reward: but the holiest man that
lives ought to say with David, enter not into judgment with thy servant O
Lord, for no man living shall be justified in thy sight, if thou enter into
judgment with him.

Sixthly, If God does give unto us both our good works or merits and also the
reward, then our good works do not condignely merit everlasting life: but the
antecedent is true, therefore the consequent.

Of these six Bellarmine cites only the second, and that only he answers,
viz. that Bernard teaches, that eternal life is not due to merits by right
absolutely, because they presuppose both the grace and the promise of God; but
grace and promise being presupposed, eternal life is due by right, which he
would prove out of 2 Timothy 4. 7. and Heb. 6. Reply, Bernard speaks with
presupposall, both of Gods grace and promise; and teaches that good works,
though proceeding from grace, though having the promise of reward; yet to them
eternal life is not due by right, neither do they merit it condignely, as is
proved by the six reasons, whereof Bellarmine answeareth never a one. For in
the first reason he speaks of the sufferings, according to the Apostles
meaning, of the sons and heirs of God, which they suffer for or with Christ;
having this promise that if they suffer with Christ they shall be glorified
with him: yet these, though one man should sustain them all, are not condign
to the future glory.

As for the second which he would seem to answer, instead of explaining it,
he plainly contradicts it, saying that our merits are such as eternal life
is due to them by right.

In the third argument Bernard does not only presuppose, that the good works
or merits, where of he speaks, do proceed from grace; but from thence
proves, that because they are Gods gifts, they cannot merit of God; but the
more a man has of them, the more he is indebted to God.

In the fourth he shows, that between all our works, though never so much
proceeding from grace, and the future glory which is promised to them, there is
no proportion.

In the fifth he speaks of them that are most godly, who have both grace and
promise of glory, that they are so far from condign merit, that if God
should enter into judgment with them, none of them could be justified in his
sight.

In the sixth he sets down the degrees of grace freely bestowed upon us:
that he does condonare peccata, donare merita, and redonare praemia. Of his
grace he forgiveth our sins, of his grace he gives us good works, which
he calls merits: of his grace redoubled upon us he graciously gives the
reward, which he has freely promised, as for his proofs out of 2 Timothy 4. and
Heb. 6. I shall answer in their due Infr. adargum. 4.
place. Unto this Testimony Bellarmine might have added another out of the same
Sermon. It is necessary first of all to believe that thou can not have
remission of sins but by the indulgence of God: then, that thou can have no
good work, unless he also give it: lastly, that by no good works thou can
merit, that is, obtain eternal life, unless it also be freely given thee:
nisi gratis detur and illa.

. VII. The other three places are these. First, Totum hominis In Psalm. 91.
sermon. 15. In cantic. sermon. 61. In attercat* cum Diabolo.
meritum est, si totam spem suam ponat in eo, qui totum hominem salvum facit.
Secondly, Proinde meritum meum, miseratio Domini. Thirdly, Fateor, non sum
dignus ego I confess I am not worthy, neither can I by mine own merits
obtain the Kingdom of heaven. But my Lord possessing it by a double right,
the inheritance of his Father, and the merit of his passion, contenting him
self with the one, he gives me the other.

To these three together Bellarmine frames two misshapen answers. First,
that Bernards meaning was, that our merits are not of our selves, but from Gods
mercy, and that he would prove out of his 68. Sermon on the Canticles: Merita
habere cures, habita data noveris. And therefore, say I, his meaning was, that
our good works do not merit: For being his free gifts, they make us indebted
to God, as he teaches, and not him to us. But indeed Bernard does not speak
of our works or merits, either as from us, or as in us, but of the mercy of
God in pardoning our sins for the merit of his Son. And therefore whiles
God abounds with mercies in Christ, he says he cannot want merits. For man's
justice is Gods indulgence, and therefore blessed is the man, to whom the Lord
imputes not sin: O solus In Cantic. sermon. 23.
vere beatus, cuinon imputavit Dominus peecatum -- omnes enim peccaverunt --
sufficit mihi ad omnem justitiam solum habere propitium cui soli peccavi. Omne
quod mihi ipse non imputare decreverit, sic est quasi non fuerit. N^npeccare,
Dei justitia est, hominis justitia, indulgentia Dei.

His second answer is conjecturall, that perhaps Bernard out of humility (and
perhaps not) was ignorant of his merits, and out of the uncertainty of his own
grace did not trust in his merits, but in the mercy of God alone.

Reply, He knew that he had no merits, but Gods mercies in Christ, because he
was not ignorant that he had many sins, which notwithstanding, he was confident
in the mercies of God and merits of Christ. Neither was he so uncertain of
such inherent righteousness in himself, as whereby he might hope to be
justified and saved, as he was certain of the contrary.

As for his allegation out of the 68. sermon* in Cantic. It is evident, the
Bernard by merits understands nothing but good works, and not merits
properly so called, as appears by that before alleged ex sermon. 1. de
annunciat: and out of the same. 68. sermon in cantic. Non est quod jam quaeras
quibus meritis speremus bona, presertim cum andias apud Prophetam, Non propter
vos, sed propter me ego faciam dicit Dominus, which is no less than to deny
merits, and in one of the places by Bellarmine In Cantic. sermon. 61.
cited Meum proinde meritum miseratio Domini. Non plane sum meriti inops,
quandiu ille miserationum non fuerit: quod si misericordiae Dei multae, mult^s
nihilominus^ ego in meritis sum. But that famous Testimony of his, I may not
omit, though I have mentioned it before, in the end of his book, Degratia and
l. arbitr. where he distinguishing the gifts of God into merita, and praemia,
and therefore speaking of merits as proceeding from grace; he says, those
things which we call our merits, that is to say good works, spei quaedam sunt
seminaria, charitatis incentiva, occulta praedestinationis indicia, suturae
faelicitatis pr^sagia, vi^ regni, non caus^ regnandi, they are certain
seminaries of hope, motives of Charity, tokens of secret predistination,
presages of future felicity, the way of the kingdom, not the cause of
reigning: and therefore no meritorious cause of salvation.

. VIII. And these were all the Testimonies, which Bellarmine Other testimonies
not touched by Bellarmine.
takes notice of, as alleged by us out of the Fathers. But I have not so done
with them. For as in the question of justification by faith alone I produced a
multitude of Testimonies, to prove^ the consent of the ancient Church with us:
So in this place, that good works are not truly meritorious of eternal life,
I do prove not only by all those Testimonies (for if we be not justified by
them, we are not saved for them) but also by a new supply of Testimonies,
which by diverse learned men have been collected, but chiefly by our most
learned Answer to the Jesuits challenge, page 500. etc.
Primate, whereof I will recite so many, as his Malone, page 692 etc.
adversary has meddled with, that I may briefly, and as it were in transcursu,
vindicate them from his cavils. Of these the first is

In Romans lib. 4. c. 4.
Origin: I can hardly persuade my self, that there can be any work which may
of duty or debt require the remuneration of God: 1.
Seeing even that, that we are able to do, to think, or to speak, we do it
by his gift and bounty: What debt then shall there be of his, whose grace has
gone before? from whence I reason thus: To no gifts of his, God is a debtour,
or owes reward, as due:

All our good works are his gifts, therefore to none of our good works is God
a debtour, or owes reward, as due. Whereof the reason being, because they are
the gifts of God, proceeding from his grace, which precedeth our good works,
he is proved to be ridiculum caput, who answers, that Origin speaks of
such works, as are done by the sole power of man's free will without grace.

. IX. Hilarie, writing upon the parable of the Workmen, Matthew. 20. having
said, that the Gentiles, who upon the preaching 2. Hilar. i^ Matthew. can. 20.
of the Gospel were to be saved by the justification of faith, were meant by
those, who being called at the eleventh hour, were the first that in the
evening received the gift of the wages appointed for the labor of the whole
day: he adds these words. Merces quidem ex dono nulla est, quia debetur ex
opere, sed gratuitam Deus omnibus ex fidei justificatione donavit. Wages indeed
by gift there is none, because by the work it is due: but to all by the
justification of faith God has given the same free. Whence I argue: No wages
is of free gift. Why? because it is due to the work.

Eternal life is of free gift, which God gives to all that believe by the
justification of faith. Therefore eternal life is not wages. Mat. Yea, but
Hilarie elsewhere says, that the kingdom of God In Mat. can. 5. 9.
is the wages of such as live well. Answ. It is merces indeed non debita sed
gratuita; not wages, but a free reward. For so in this very place he calls it
first, donum mercedis the gift of reward, secondly, gratuitum, free, thirdly,
in the words next following gratuitam mercedem, a free reward; and lastly he
says, that the gift of grace does give the reward of the Law well and
blamelessely kept, to them that believe by faith, being of the last made the
first, that is, saved. For the first which were made last, who murmured at this
free reward, were of the many that were called, Matthew. 20. 16.
but not of the few which are chosen. Absurd therefore is his answer, who
says, that Hillarie says no more, but that faith and justification by faith
is the free gift of God, but that there is not a word to signify that heaven
is not the wages of good works which notwithstanding is the thing to be
concluded from hence. So that according to this wife exposition, by the wages,
which according to the parable is in the evening given to the laborers, is
faith, or justification by faith, meant, and not eternal life which is the end
of our faith and the reward of all our labors; which according to the
judgment of all Writers, even Bellarmine himself is signified by the
day-penny given to them who of the last were made first: For the day-penny was
both the mercenary wages contracted for by those who were first; and the free
reward, which the bounty of the Master of the vineyard bestowed freely on the
last, who were made first, that is, saved.

. X. Ambrose, after he had said, Hic quidem luctamur, sed 3. Ambr^s. ex^ort.
ad virgins.
alibi coronamur, Here we wrestle but elsewhere we are crowned: lest he should
seem to arrogate unto himself, as if by his wrestling he deserved the
crown, adds by way of prevention: I spoke not of my self alone, but of all
men in general. Nam unde mihi tantum meriti, cui indulgentia pro corona est?
for whence should I have so great merit, to whom indulgence is for a crown?
Hence I reason thus: to whom Gods indulgence or mercy in pardoning their
sins is their crown, they cannot plead their merits: But to Ambrose and to
all good men Psalm. 130. 4. 32. 1.
indulgence is their crown: therefore they cannot plead their merits.
Wherefore this was not more humbly, than truly spoken of Ambrose. And
elsewhere In Psalm. 118. sermon. 20.
: which of us can subsist without mercy? quid possumus dignum praemiis facere
coelestibus, what can we do worthy the heavenly rewards? -- by what merit of
man is it granted: that this corruptible flesh should put on incorruption? --
the sufferings of this time are unworthy to the glory that is to come.
Therefore the form of heavenly decrees does proceed with men, not according to
our merits, but according to Gods mercy. To this a frivolous answer is given,
that Ambrose speaks of merits, as contradistinguished from Gods mercy: when
Ambrose speaks of himself and of all the faithful who are endued with
grace, who notwithstanding are not able to do or suffer any thing worthy of
the future glory.

. XI. Basil on those words, Psalm. 33. 18. the eye of the 4. Basil in Psalm. 32.
Lord is upon them that hope in his mercy, he says, that he does hope in his
mercy, who not trusting in his own good deeds, nor looking to be justified
by works, has the hope of salvation only in the mercies of God.

To this an impudent answer is given, that they are said to hope in Gods
mercy, who hope that their good works, proceeding from the grace of God, are
by his mercy made meritorious of eternal life. For which they have have no
ground either in Scriptures or Fathers, praeter impudentiam asseverandi. And
surely, if this had been Basils meaning, he should have set down the
description of a proud justitiarie, rather than of an humble Christian, such as
he intended to describe. For speaking of those words, who hope in his mercy,
he says, (...) etc. the Psalmist sets forth the humility of them that serve
the Lord: how do they hope on his mercies? for he that does not trust to his
own good deeds, nor expects to be justified by works, but has his only
hope of salvation in the mercies of God: but he that trusts, that by the
grace of God, his works, are made meritorious, he does with the Pharisee
trust in his works, as proceeding from grace. For the Pharisee, though he
acknowledged his righteousness to come from God, and therefore thanketh him
for it, yet he is noted to have trusted (...) ^8. 9.
in himself. The mercy of God, in which the faithful hope, is his mercy in
forgiving their sins, not in making their good works meritorious: as
appears by the words immediately following: for says Basil, when he shall
call that saying to mind, Behold the Lord and his reward to render to every
man according to his work, and shall consider his own evil deeds, he is
indeed afraid of punishment, and through fear subjecteth (...)
himself to those things which are threatened: but that he may not be
swallowed up of sorrow (...), he conceives good hope looking to the mercies of
God and his love to mankind, (...), and the hope which he conceives is this,
that his soul shall be delivered from death. But though they cannot answer
this place, yet they will clavum clavo petere, and requite us with another out
of Basil, which shall be answer^d in his due place.

In the mean time I add two other Testimonies out of Basil, for writing on
those words of the Psalm, And redeem us for thy mercies sake. See, says he,
In Psalm 43. V. ult.
how he concludes his speech. After a thousand virtues, whence does he pray
to be saved? By Gods mercy and bounty.

3. And again, in Psalm. 23. 5. where David having descrybed the just and
upright man who shall be saved, says, this man shall receive the blessing
from God, and mercy from God his Savior. Here says Basil he shows the fruit
of good deeds, and very fitly did he conjoyne blessing and mercy. For the
rewards, which men do think of, are granted to men only for Gods bounty
sake. For all the righteousnesses of men, do not equal so much as the gifts
already granted, much less those which are to come, which do exceed the
thought of man.

. XII. Adv. Pelag. lib. 2.
Hierome, Pro nihilo salvos facies eos; haud dublum, quin 5. Hierome.
(...), qui ^on pr^prio merit^, sed Dei salvantur clementia, for nothing thou
shall save them, no doubt he means the just, who are not saved by their own
merit, but by the mercy of God.

2. Again, Adv. Pelag. lib. 1.
Animadverte, quod beatam se dicat (Maria Matter Domini) non (...) merito atque
virtute, sed Dei in se habitantis clementia. Observe, that the blessed Virgin
calls her self blessed, not by her own merit or virtue, but by the clemency
of God dwelling in her.

3. And again, Jbid.
Tunc justi sumus, then we are just when we confess our selves to be
sinners: and our righteousness consists not in our own merit, but in the
mercy of God.

4. Ad Demetriadem.
God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble, but where is grace, it
is not the retribution of works, but the largess of the giver; that the
saying of the Apostle may be fulfilled, it is not of him that wills, nor of
him that runs, but of God that shows mercy.

5. Writing on those words, Lib. 17. in Esaiam, c. 64. 8.
Esai. 64. 8. thou art our Father, he says, Si nostra consideremus merita
desperandum est, si tuam autem clementiam, etc. If we consider our merits, we
must despair, but if thy clemency, who do scourge every son whom thou
receivest, we dare power forth our prayers.

6. In ^sai. lib. 6. cap. 13. 7.
When the day of judgment or of death shall come, all hands will be dissolved
-- because no work shall be found worthy Gods justice, and in his sight shall
no man living be j^stified, (namely, if he enter into judgment with him)
whereupon the Prophet says in the Ps^lme, If thou Lord observe iniquities, who
shall abide?

To these two that threadbare answer is given, that they speak of humane
works not assisted by grace: when it is plain, that the former words are
spoken in the person of Gods children, whose good works are always assisted
by grace: the latter of all men, even of the best, whose works, though
proceeding from grace, are stained with the flesh, and therefore not worthy of
Gods justice.

. XIII. The same answer is given to the testimonies of 7. Macarius and Marcus.
Maca^ius and Marcus the Eremits; which cannot be so eluded. Hom. 15. page 206.
Macarius speaking of the dignity of Christians, for whom God has prepared a
kingdom, writes thus, As touching the gift therefore which they shall
inherit, a man might well say, that if any one should ^ven from the creation of
Adam to the consummation of the world, fight against Satan, and should suffer
afflictions (...), he should do no great matter in respect of the glory which
he shall inherit.

Marcus among his twenty two (...).
sentences concerning those who think to be justified by works, which in the
first ^entence he calls, (...) has diverse against merits, whereof I will
cite a few.

Our Lord, says he, Sent. 2.
when he would show, that the keeping of the whole Law is (...) debita, to be
performed as a debt, and that the adoption of sons is given by his blood; he
says, when you shall have done all things that are commanded you, say, we are
unprofitable servants, we have done what was our duty to do: (...) Therefore
the kingdom of heaven is not wages or a mercenary reward of works, but the
Grace or free Gift of the Lord prepared for his faithful servants.

The Sent. 3.
servant does no require liberty (...), as a de^erved reward -- but receives
it (...) as given by grace.

Sent. 17.
Some not doing the Commandments think they believe well. Others doing them,
look to receive the kingdom (...), as due wages, (...). both sorts miss the
heavenly Canaan.

Sent. 18.
From Lords no reward is due to servants (...), neither do they obtain
liberty, unless they serve well.

Sent. 19.
If Christ dyed for us according to the Scriptures, and we live not to our
selves, but to him that dyed for us and rose again; surely (...) we are bound
as debtours to serve him u^till death: how then shall we esteem the adoption
or inheritance of sons (...) due unto us? 8. Chrysostom.


. XIV. Out of Chrysostom many pregnant testimonies are alleged, first, In
Col* (...). ^.
In Coloss. homil. 2. Why does he call it (...), lot or inheritance by lot?
(...), etc. he shows that no man by his own good works, does obtain the
kingdom -- for no man shows forth such a conversation, that he should be
worthy of the kindgdome, but this is alto^ether of the gift of God, wherefore
he says, when you shall have done all, say, we are unprofitable servants, for
what things we ought to do we have done. The same has The^philact.

To this you may add that which I cited before out of his Treatise De
compunctione ad St^lochium, and that which he writes in Psalm. 4. and 5. and
in his sermon De prim^ homine praelato ^mni creatur^. In which it is said,
though we should die ten thousand deaths and should show forth all virtue,
though we should perform ten thousand good works yet we cannot perform any
thing worthy of those honors bestowed upon us, worthy of that heavenly
kingdom, or correspondent unto it, but it is of his m^rcie, of his love, of
his grace, that we are saved, than which nothing can be spoken more plain
against the merit of ^ondignity.

To all which a senseless answer is given, that heaven is the free gift of
God, and yet is purchased by our merits, which implies a contradiction within
it self, and is expressly repugnant to the Scriptures, Rom* 4. 4. and 11. 6.
And the reason which is given to prove it, does overthrow it; because the good
works which they call merits, are the free gifts of God, and therefore cannot
merit of God, as I have showed before.

. XV. To that which is alleged out of the life of Saint 9.
Athanas. in vita Antonii. August. in Psalm. 36. conc. 2.
Anth^ny, and out of Augustine, in Psalm. 36. Conc. 2. in both which places is
notably expressed the infinite disproportion between that we can do or suffer
(which the Papists call merits) and the heavenly reward, which evidently
overthrows the Popish doctrine of meri^s, as I have heretofore proved; it is
answered, that notwithstanding all this disproportion, eternal life is given,
and justly given as the reward thereof. But the question is not whether God
does justly give the reward which he has freely promised, but whether we do
merit and deserve it. This answer therefore is frivolous.

Out of Augustine I have before produced manifold and manifest testimonies: but
yet because the Papists allege out of him two Assertions, which to them seem
contrary to that we hold; to wit, that God is our debtour in respect of
eternal life, and that in justice he does render it unto us; I will br^efly
clear them. For first Augustine In Psalm. 32: conc. 1. I^ Psalm. 83. De verbis
Apostoli, s^rm. 16. In Psalm. 109.
every where professes, that God is not a debtour unto us in respect of out
desert, but in regard of his gracious promise, which proves not our merit, but
the contrary. For what he freely promised without respect of our worthiness or
desert, that he also promised to give freely. And therefore eternal life,
when it is given according to his promise, it is given freely and without our
desert. God is a debtour only in respect of his promise, a debtour unto
himself, as I have said before, in respect of his truth and fidelity; it
being impossible, that he should lie or deny himself, but not a debtour to us
in respect of our desert or dignity. ^or whatsoever he has promised us,
Quicquid promisi, indignis promisit, ut ^on quasi operibus merce*
promitteretu^* se gratia a nomiue suo gratis dare^ur.
he has promised it to them that are unworthy, as was alleag^d before out of
Augustine in Psalm. 109. that it should not be promised as a wages or a
mercenary reward, but being Grace might according to the name be graciously
given.

Again, it is just with God, that he should render to the faithful eternal
life, not because they deserve it, but because he has promised it: for what he
has promised he is faithful and just to perform. But he has promised
without respect of our desert to give it freely, therefore it is just, that he
should freely give it to us, and without our desert.

XI.. XVI. Theodoret in Sophoniam, c. 3. in fine.
Theodoret, The salvation of men depends on 11.
Gods mercy alone: for we do not attain unto it, as wages: but it is the
gift of Gods goodness, wherefore the Lord says, Propter me salvabo, I will
save for mine own sake, etc.

To this the answer is shameless: that this place makes not for our purpose.
And why? For by salvation is not meant eternal life, but of our first
vocation, whereof there is no show. As though Theodoret did contend that we do
not attain to our first vocation (by which we are as it were called into the
vineyard) as wages. And again, he speaks of the Church, that is, of them
that are already called, and no doubt, but that by the same grace, by which we
are elected, called, justified, we are also saved: but that was free and
undeserved, and therefore so is this.

Again, I^ Romans 8. 18.
The crowns surpass the fights, the rewards are not to be compared with the
labo^rs. For the labor is small but great gain is hoped for, and therefore
he called those things which are expected, not wages, but glory, Romans 8. 18.
and in Romans 6. 23. Hic non dicit mercedem, sed gratiam, here he does not say
wages but grace.

It is answered, that although the reward do much surpass the pains, yet it
is a just reward. No doubt. But why just? Not because it is equal as it ought
to be, if it be rendered to merit of condignity; but because it is promised,
and accordingly given of God the righteeous Judge.

Prospers testimony De vocat. beat. lib. 1. c. 17.
which Bellarmine (to whom his Disciple 12. Prosper.
does refer us) sought to obscure, was before cleared to be most pregnant
against the merit of good works: unto which we may add that on Psalm. 102.
upon these words, who crowns with mercy; that we may understand, says he,
that by the same mercy the crowns of good works which he calls merits are
given, by which were given the merits of the crowns, that is, freely and
without merit or desert.

. XVII. And this was the doctrine of the primitive Church for the first five
hundred years, and was continued in the next five hundred, and in the third
also, as is plentifully proved by multitude of testimonies, in the said learned
work of our most learned Primate, unto which, because his adversary gives no
answer, I will refer the Chri stian reader, citing only a few of the latter
times, as it were, for a taste. Venerable Bede, Bid in Psa. 23
Et hoc, non ex meritis, sed sola gratia. And thus that the godly man shall be
well rewarded, is not by merits, but by grace only.

In Dominic. septuages.
Haymo: vita aeterna nulli per debitum redditur, sed per gratuitam
misericordiam datur Eternal life is rendered to none by debt or duty, but is
given by free mercy.

In Joan. 1.
Rupertus, the greatness or eternity of heavenly glory is a matter not of
merit but of grace.

Photius apud Oecumen. in Romans 6. 23.
Photius In Romans 6. 23. he did not say that eternal life is (...). (...),
(...) the wages of good works, but a free gift.

Oecumen. in Col. 1. 12.
Oecumen. in Coloss. 1. 12. (...) etc. well did he call it (...), as being a
certain inheritance and gift, for the sufferings of this present time are not
worthy, etc. Romans 8. 18. On which place also he says, Oecumen. in Romans 8. 18.
the Apostle shows, that we neither can suffer, nor confer any thing
worthy the remuneration that shall be there.

I conclude with De Mensurat. Crucis B.
Anselmus, Si homo mill annis serviret Deo etiam ferventissime, non mereretur
ex condigno dimidiam diem esse in regno coelorum. If a man should serve God a
thousand years and that most fervently he should not condignely merit to be
half a day in the Kingdom of heaven.

CHAP. V. Bellarmines dispute, sirst, concerning the name merit. Secondly,
concerning the thing, which he endeavors to prove out of the Scriptures.
. I.

NOw we are come to Bellarmines dispute concerning De justis. lib. 5. c. 2.
merits. Wherein he discourses first of the name, and afterward of the thing
it self. As Of the name Merit.
touching the name he endeavors to prove, that it is grounded on the
Scriptures. And to this purpose he alleges in the first place, Eccl. The
first proo^e Eccl. 16. 14.
16. 14. which he according to the vulgar Latin translation, reads thus;
omnis mis^ricordia faciet locum unicuique secundum meritum operum suorum, all
mercy shall make place for every one according to the merit of his works. So
that his first proof is nothing but a corrupt translation of a testimony cited
out of an Apocryphal Book. The words in the original are these (...), make
way for every work of mercy: (...), for every man shall find according to
his wo^kes, that is, says Bellarmine, according to the merit of his works.

Answ. But the phra^e (...), which is often used in the Scripture, as when it
is said God will judge every man, or he will render to every one, according to
their works, does not import merit, that the name of merit should thereon be
grounded; but the quality of men's works, whether good or evil, that is, he
will graciously reward them that have done well; and he will severely punish
those that have done evil: and so it is expounded, 2 Cor. 5. 10. according to
that which he has done, whether good or evil, so Romans 2. 6, 7, 8. Matthew. 16.
27. cum Matthew. 25. 46. Ioh. 5. 29. This truth is acknowledged by In Psalm. 7.
poenit.
Gregory the great: it is one thing says he to render secundum opera
according to works, and another thing to render propter ipsa ^pera for the
works themselves: for in that which is said, according to works, ipsa operum
qualitas intelligitur, the quality it self of the works is understood, that
whose works shall appear to be good, his retribution also shall be
glorious, which words were spoken by Gregory in answer to an objection, which
is the same with Bellarmines in this place. If the felicity of Saints be
mercy, and not acquired by merits (as you say) what shall become of that which
is written, and thou shall render to every man according to his works. If it
be rendered according to works, how shall it be esteemed mercy? But, says he,
it is one thing to say according to works, whereby the quality only is noted,
good or bad; another, for the works themselves, which notes merit. But the
Scripture no where says that God does reward the godly, pr^pter opera sua, but
thus it speaks, To thee Lord, mercy for thou rewardest every man, that is,
every good man according to his work, you see then, that the obje^tion made
against Gregory's assertion, or rather David's, is Bellarmines; the answer,
which Gregory makes is ours.

Yea but Hierome, says Bellarmine, who was most skillful in the three
languages does use to translate that which in the Hebrew and Greek, is
according to works by the word merit, saying, according to the merit of their
works.

Answ. If he did so, that would not prove the use of the name merit in the
Scriptures; but indeed he does ^ot so: for usually he renders secundum opera
according to their works. Indeed Latin interpreters of latter times in the
Church of Rome, being poisoned with the Popish doctrine of merits, are very
forward as might be showed at large, to ^oist in the word merit into their
translations where the original, which they translate, has no such thing: an
instance whereof I will hereafter give in the translatour of Ignatius. The
vulgar Latin is more sparing howsoever Genesis 4. 13. it renders the words of
Caines complaint thus, Major est iniquitas mea, quam ^t veniam merear: My sin
is greater than I can merit, that is, according to the ordinary use among the
Latins, obtain pardon: for it cannot without great absurdity be understood
of merit properly. Howbeit the words are rather thus to be rendered, my
punishment is greater than I am able to bear: which interpretation is proved
by those reasons which Cain uses in that place, to aggravate, not his sin
but his punishment. Besides that place the verb mereri is used but eight Deuteronomy.
7. 10. I^s. 11. 20. Iu^. 20. 10. 2 Chro^ 19. 2. Esib. 16. 18. I^b. 6. 2. and
11. 6. Heb. 10. 29.
times in the Latin Bible, and always in sense the worse, viz. deserving
punishment: and that is the proper sense: for sins are properly merits of
punishment, and therefore to merit punishment is properly attributed to them.
The Nowne merit is used but thrice, and that only in the Book of
Ecclesiasticus, that is to say, besides this place in two others, where it
signifies, not merit of reward, but worth or dignity, as namely of the soul.
chap. 10, 31. Of the men, chap. 38. 18. So that the name merit taken in the
popish sense, for a good work deserving the reward of eternal life, has no
warrant at all not so much as in the Latin vulgar translation, and much less
in the original Scriptures themselves.

. II. His second testimony is Heb. 13. 16. to do good and to communicate His
second testimony, Heb. 13. 16.
forget not, talibus enim host^is promeretur Deus, for with such hosts (say our
Rhemists) God is promerited. The Greek word is (...), unaptly and barbarously
translated promeretur, when as it properly signifies is well pleased: and the
meaning is, that such sacrifices are (...); well pleasing or acceptable unto
God. Oecumenius expounds it by the word (...) is pleased. But not all things
that please God do merit of him. Servants must be (...) well pleasing to
their Masters, Tit. 2. 6* and do that which is pleasing in their sight, who
notwithstanding cannot merit any thing at their hands. So all our obedience in
do^ing that will of God which is (...) acceptable, is pleasing to God, and we
our selves in so doing are (...) acceptable to God: but when we have done all
things that we can, we cannot merit so much as thanks, but must confess our
selves to be unprofitable servants, in doing but that which was our duty to
do. Luke 17. 10. Here therefore nothing but a barbarous translation is
alleged to prove that, which is not in the original ^text. Bellarmine, though
he cannot deny it to be barbarous, yet he says it is a very fit translation:
for most properly we say in Latin, that one man does merit of another and
oblige him to him to himself, wh^ does any thing whereby another is pleased or
delighted. I answer, first, that who so does merit of another does also please
him: but not whosoever does that which is pleasing unto another, does also
merit of him as I said before of servants. Secondly, there is great disparity
between God and man. One man may merit of another, or oblige or make him
beholding unto him. It is therefore a strange conceit of Bellarmine, because
one man may merit of another, by doing him a pleasure, that therefore a man may
m^rit of God* or oblige him unto him. By doing good we profit our selves and
others, but we cannot profit God: our goodness reaches not to him, Psalm. 16. 2.
Can a man be profitable unto God? says Eliphaz: is it any pleasure to the
Almighty that thou art righteous, or is it gain to him that thou make thy
way perfect, Job. 22. 2, 3. and so Elihu, Job. 35. 7, 8. This translation
therefore, as it is barbarous, so it is impious, in making God beholden unto
us. Yea but says Bellarmine, this word being joined with that of sacrifices.
does not only signify, that God is delighted with good works, but that his
favor is procured, and he induced to reward them that do well. Answer. The
Apostle does not say (...) God is made propitious, or as Bellarmine alleging
out of Latin Chrysostom placatur, where the Greek is (...) as in the text of
the Apostle. For the sacrifice of Christ alone by it self is propitiatory; the
sacrifices of the Law, only as they were types of it. As for the spiritual
sacrifices, whereof the Apostle speaks, they are not (...) propitiatory, but
only (...) acceptable and well pleasing in Christ, as being perfumed with the
odours of his sacrifice. This therefore was but a poor and indeed a base
shift, which Bellarmine was put to, who finding no relief in the original
text of the Scripture, is feign to flee unto corrupt translations, as he does
not only in these two places already alleged; but also in that allegation of
Chrysostom, for placatur: and as afterward we shall see in citing Ignatius
and other Greek Fathers.

. III. And this is all the footing that the name merit has in the Scriptures.
For though, Bellarmine add two other arguments: yet they belong not to the
name but to the thing. So that here Bellarmine might have begun his third
Chapter with this transition, sed ut ad rem ipsam veniamus, Having spoken of
the name, let us come to the thing. For his other two arguments, the one from
the word Dignity, the other, from the name reward used in the Scriptures, do
not prove the use of the of the name merit in the holy Scriptures, but serve,
in his conceit, to prove the thing; and are indeed two principal arguments
which he brings to prove the merit of good works, which it shall suffice to
answer in their due place. For I do not think them worthy of double c Cap. 3.
pains. Only for the present, I answer, to the first, that where is speech of
our dignity, it is to be ascribed to Gods dignation, as Bernard well says In
Dedic. Eccl. sermon. 5.
Digni nos sumus sedipsius dignatione, non dignitate nostra, we are worthy,
but by his dignation, or deigning to accept of us as worthy, not by our own
worthiness, secondly, the words dignus and digne sometimes do signify not the
equality of worth, but that which is convenient meet or becoming as (...)

(...) Col. 1. 10. (...) 1 Thessalonians. 2. 12. 3 Ioh. 6. (...) Ephesians. 4. 1. (...) Phil.
1. 27.
To the second, thatthere are rewards free, liberal, and undeserved as well as
those which be mercenary, and deserved and therefore the name of reward does not
always presuppose merit, or desert. To which purpose let the reader compare
these parallel places, Mat. 5. 46. Luke 6. 32. where the words (...) and (...)
are used in the self same sense. For if you love those that love you, what
reward have you, quam mercedem habetis says Matthew, quae vobis est gratia?
says Luke, what thanks have you? in the one is (...), in the other (...).
Thus much of the name.

. IV. For the thing Bellarmine brings three sorts of proofs: For the thing:
Bellarmines proofs out of the Scriptures. De ius^if. l. 5. c. 3.
Authority of Scripture, Testimonies of Fathers, and reason. The authorityes of
Scripture he reduces to seven heads. The first is of those places wh^re
eternal life is called merces, reward. His reason is thus framed: If eternal
life be the reward of good works, then good works do merit it: but the
former is true, viz. that eternal life is the reward good works: therefore
the latter, viz. that good works do merit eternal life.

Answ. The proposition he takes for granted: all his proof in this place
being that sine dubitatione without doubt it is true. But in his second Chapter
he proved it by this, which goes for a maxi^e among them, that merces and
meritum are relatives. But I answer by distinction. That merces reward is of
two sorts. It is either debita due, as justly deserved, or grat^ita as freely
bestowed, and without desert: as Ambrose also distinguishes. Alia est merces,
says he, Epist. 1. l. 1.
liberalitatis and gratia, aliud virtutis stipendium, laboris rem^neratio,
which distinction is insiunated by the Apostle, Romans 4. 4. for reward is either
imputed (...), according to grace, as the inheritance of an adopted son: or
rendered (...) according to debt, or duty, as the hire or wages of an hired
servant, or labourer, 1 Timothy 5. 18.
who is worthy of his hire. And is acknowledged by De iustif. l. 1. c. 21..
Deinde.
Bellarmine. For when the Apostle says, to him that works, the reward is not
imputed according to grace, but according to debt, satis aperite indicat, esse
quandam mercedem, qua imputari possit secundum gratiam, non secundum debitum,
he does plainly enough show, that there is a certain reward, which may be
imputed according to grace, not according to debt. Merces noftra says Pr^sat.
in Psalm. 31.
Augustine, gratia vocatur. Si gratia est gratis datur. Our reward is called
gratia, (so the Latin translateth (...)) if it be grace, it is freely given.
And again, De v^rb. Apost. sermon 1. 3.
God has sent a Physician, he has sent a Savior, he has sent him who
should heal freely: that is but little, that he should heal freely, who
should also give reward to them that are healed. Nothing can be added to this
benevolence. Who is he that will say, let me heal thee, and I give thee a
reward. Of this free reward we have examples and Testimonies in the holy
Scriptures; as first, that which Bellarmine in the first place cites Cap. 2.
very impertinently to prove the name merit, Gen, 15. 1. where the Lord says
to Abraham, I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward. Psalm. 127. 3.
heritage and reward used promiscuously. Children are an heritage from the Lord,
and the fruit of the womb is his reward. And so merces and gratia, as was
noted before out of Matthew. 5. 46. and Luke 6. 30. Such a reward is our
inheritance in heaven, which is therefore called the reward of inheritance,
Col. 3. 24. And this most plainly appears in the antithesis which the
Apostle makes between the reward of sin and the reward of piety. The wages
of sin is death, but eternal life is (...), the free gift of GOD in JESUS
CHRIST our LORD, Romans 6. 23. But of this place we have spoken in our fourth
Testimony, whereby it appears, that howsoever merces debita, that is wages,
and meri^um are relatives, yet merit, and the reward of eternal life: or any
other free reward, are not relatives. Among men wages has place, because the
labourer deserves it, and he that hireth him is benefited by the labor, and
there is ordinarily a due proportion between the labor and the wages. But
with God it is otherwise: we can deserve nothing of him, neither is he
benefited by our labors, neither is there any proportion between our works
and the reward of eternal life. The proposition therefore, though by him taken
for granted, is by us to be denied.

. V. The assumption, that eternal life is the reward of good Assumption,
eternal life is the reward of good works.
works, we freely confess, so it be understood of a free reward; which, as
it was graciously promised, so it is freely and undeservedly given. Bellarmine
therefore should have proved, that eternal life is a mercenary, and on our
part a deserved reward. But of all the places which he quoteth, both in the
second and third Chapters, where the word mer^es is used, not one does prove
eternal life to be a deserved reward, or imply the merit of condignity. As
Genes. 15. 1. I am thy shield and thy exceeding great reward, 2 Chronicles. 15. 7.
Your work shall be rewarded, Prove. 11. 18. To him that sowe^h righteousness
there shall be a sure reward. For as Hos. 10. 12. He that sows in
righteousness, shall reap in mercy, Wisd. 5. 16. The righteous shall live
for ever, and their reward is with the Lord, Eccl. 18. 22. The reward of the
Lord abides for ever, Esai. 40. 10. Behold the Lord will come, and his reward
with* him, so Apo^. 22. 12. Matthew. 5. 12. great is your reward in heaven, 1
Cor. 3. 8. Every one shall recive his own reward, according to his own labor.

. VI. Only there may be question of that place, Matthew. Of the parable Matthew.
20.
20. 8. Call the laborers, and give them their wages, which Bellarmin^ cites
in the third Chapter, and afterward urges, both in the same Chapter, and in
the seventeenth, and also nineteenth. And for as much as this place is often
alleged by the Papists to prove, that eternal life is the wages, or hire due
to good wo^kes, I will therefore show, first, that it makes not for them:
secondly, that it makes First, that this ^rable makes not for the Papists.
against them. For the first: I affirm, that from parables nothing can be
proved that is besides the scope of them. The scope of this parable is to show,
that many who are first shall be last, and the last first, and that many are
called but few chosen, as appears both by the last verse of the former
Chapter, for proof whereof this parable is* propounded, for so he says, verse.
1. For the kingdom of heaven, etc. And also by the sixteenth verse of the
Chapter, which is the reddition of the parable. So the last shall be first, and
the first last, for many be called but few are chosen. The first are they who
were called early in the morning, and hired for a certain wages or hire, viz.
for a penny by the day. But the first, in the sequel of the parable became the
last. If therefore it be alleged, that to these eternal life was given for
the hire of their labor; I say, it is not only besides, but also contrary to
the scope of the parable, which was to show, that those who were first c^lled,
were of the many that are called, but not of the few that are chosen, and
consequently, not of the few that are saved. The penny therefore that was
promised by the householder, and received by these workmen, does not signify
eternal life as Saint Regul. cont: 255. 256.
Basil supposes. For though they received the penny, yet because they were
called but not chosen, they missed of eternal life. Thus therefore I argue:
Eternal life was not received by these workmen; for they were called, and not
chosen. The penny, which was promised, was received by these workmen, verse.
10, 11, 14. therefore the penny, which was promised, is not eternal life. And
this may be gathered out of the parable it self. First, because these we^e
mere hirelings, who would not work, but for a certain hire, led only by
reward, for the obtaining whereof they trusted in their own merits. Secondly,
because after they had received their penny, they envied their fellow workmen,
whom the Lord rewarded, not according to their merits, but according to his
own bounty, to which they trusted and not to their own merit. Thirdly,
because they murmured against the householder, as if he had not dealt with them
according to their desert, who had wrought twelve hours, and had borne the
burden and the heat of the day. Fourthly, because being sharply reproved by
the Lord of the vineyard, they were sent away with indignation, saying to one
of them, which was intended to all: take that which is thine, and be gone: but
whither does he bid them go? Basil gues^eth, whither, they who be on the left
hand, shall be Matthew. 5. 41.
commanded to go. And this may further be proved by conference with the like
place, Luke 13. 30. where our Savior having told the Jews, who were first
called, that they should be excluded out of the kingdom of God, and the
Gentiles from all parts of the world should be admitted, says, and behold
there are last which shall be first, meaning the Gentiles: and there are first,
meaning the Jews, which shall be last, that is, excluded out of the number of
them that shall be saved. For as elsewhere also he says, Many are called
Matthew. 22. 14. (of which number was he that coming without his wedding
garment was cast into utter darkness, verse. 13.) but few are chosen.

. VII. For the second: that this parable makes against them, This parable
makes against the Papist^.
I prove thus. If this reward, whatsoever it be, were rendered according to
merit, and according to justice, as a just and deserved reward; then there
would have been a due proportion observed between the labor and the reward:
so that a greater reward should have been given to the greater labor, and a
less to the less. But here the unequal labors, of 12, of 9, of 6, of 3, of
one hour the same reward is given, viz. to every one a penny, not according to
the merit of the laborers, for then (dividing the penny into twelve parts) to
them that were called at the third hour^ nine parts of a penny, to them that
were called at the sixth hour half a penny, to them at the ninth hour the
fourth part of a penny, to them at the eleventh hour but one twelfth part of a
penny should have been given; but according to the good pleasure of the
householder, who alleges, he might do with his own what he plealeth, and
therefore would give to him who wrought but one hour, and that in the cool of
the day, as much as to him that wrought twelve, having bo^ne the burden and the
heat of the day. Whereupon De vocat. Gent. l. 1. c. 17.
Prosper, as you have heard, infers, that whereas God did make those who
were called at the eleventh (...) equal with the first, he did it to commend
the excellency of h^ grace, not paying a price or hire to their labors, but
pouring forth the riches of his bounty upon them whom he chose without works,
that they also who took great pains and received no more than the last, might
understand, that they received a gift of grace, and not wages of works. For as
R^dulphus Dominic. in septuag. hom. 2.
Ardens speaking of these words verse. 13. did thou not agree with me for a
penny; let no man, says he, think that God is by covenant as it were bound
(to us) to pay what he has promised. For as God is free to promise, so also he
is free to pay: especially, seeing as well the merits, as the rewards are his
grace. For God in us does crown nothing but his own grace; who, if he would
deal strictly with us, there would no man living be justified in his sight.
Whereupon the Apostle, who had labored more than they all, says, I reckon,
that the sufferings of this time are not condign to the future glory shall be
revealed in us, ergo hac canventio nihil ali^d est quam voluntaria Dei
promissto, therefore this agreement is nothing else but Gods voluntary promise.
In Matthew. 20.
Ferus also writing on these words says, this parable does teach us, that it
is grace, and not debt, whatsoever is given unto us of God: and that where is
no debt or duty, but all is given of grace, there no wrong is done.

And further, that you may see how little this parable makes for
merit-mongers: we may observe, that as diverse of the Fathers understood by the
first the Jews, at least the justitiaries among them, who, the Lord having
made a covenant with them of works, that for their days labor he should
give them a penny; expecting reward according to their merit, were of the first
made last: so by the last the faithful among all nations, with whom the Lord
has made the covenant of grace, not promising to pay them according to the
merit of their work, but to (...). verse. 4.
give them what to him should seem just according to the Covenant of grace,
which promises the reward of keeping the whole Law to them that truly
believe; who expecting reward, not according to their own merit, but according
to the grace u Verse. 4. and 7.
and good pleasure of God in whom they ^trusted, were of the last made the
first. So far is this parable from proving, thatet ernall life is given to
men according to the merit of their works, that it proves, that the reward
which is given, is freely given, and that those who seek ^o obtain eternal
life by their own desert, do miss of it.

. VIII. But here Bellarmine cavilleth with the answers of Bellarmines cavils
with Mela^on and Calvin.
Melancthon and Calvin, who, as is it seems, understanding, as the most do,
by the day-pennie the equal reward of eternal life, do answer: First, that
it may be called merces a reward, in regard of the promise (which it self is
free) of that which is freely given, and therefore is a reward of grace, and
not of merit: Secondly, because it is the reward of the inheritance, C^l. 3. ^4.
which, though given in Gods purpose before all times to those whom he has
elected in Christ without respect of works: yet to draw us unto obedience, and
to fit us for our inheritance, he has promised it as a free reward of our
faith and obedience: To the first Bellarmine replyeth, that the reward is given
to the works, which is the condition of the promise, and not to the promise it
self. I rejoyne, that it is given to the works, according to the promise, that
is, as a free reward.

To the second he says, that eternal is more properly called reward, than
inheritance, etc. I answer, primarily it is the inheritance intended before
all time in Christ without respect of works, and in the fullness of time
purchased by Christ, and so promised to all the faithful: and yet in a
secondary respect, that we might be allured to obedience and to good works, by
which we might be fitted for that heavenly inheritance, into which no unclean
thing can enter, it is also promised as a gracious reward, freely given of God,
not merited by us. Even as a father having adopted a son, thereby intending
to him and indeed entitling him to his inheritance; should upon his obedience,
either already performed, or to be performed, promise to make him his heir. In
this case, who seeeth not, that although the son come to his fathers
patrimony, both as his inheritance and as a reward, Yet the prime title is the
right of inherit^nce* the second is the title of free donation. But of merit
(though the son behave himself never so well) no title at all. Neither is
that the more honorable title, as Bellarmine here absurdly avoucheth, unless
that we rre to think, that the mercenary title of an hired servant, is more
honorable than the hereditary title of a son. For this is all the honor,
which, by their doctrine, accrueth to the children of God, that they turn the
adopted sons of God into mercenary servants, and the inheritance of sons
into the wages of servants. But of this, heretofore.

IX. Others, perceiving that the equality of reward rendered to labors so
unequal, as of twelve hours, and of one, cannot stand M^nats cavil.
with justice, if rendered as in justice due: (for it is just, where the reward
is of duty, that the greater labor should receive the greater reward:
howbeit, as you heard out of Ferus, where all is of grace no wrong is done; for
may I not do with mine what pleases me, Matthew. 20. 15.
says the Master of the vineyard) have sought out another evasion. That they
who were called at the eleventh hour, and so wrought but one hour, labored
as much as the first, who labored all the day: which is not worth the
confuting. For if in one hour they labored as much, as the other in twelve,
then deserved they as great a reward at the least. Why then did their fellow
laborers expect a greater reward? Why did they murmr at their Lords unequal
dealing? And why did not the Lord himself plead, that equal reward was to be
given to equal labors ^ Why did he plead his right to do with his own what
he pleases ^ but that he would have it understood, that the reward by him
given, was not of duty, but of grace; not rendered as a debt out of duty, but
given as a free reward out of his own bounty, and as Bellarmine himself
says, De ju^tis. l. 5. cap. 19.
non ex justitia, sed ex liberalitate. This fiction therefore, never heard of
before, was by Maldonate In Mat. 20.
devised for a poor shift in a desperate cause.

X. Bellarmines second argument is taken from those places, Bellarmines second
argument
wherein it is taught that the heavenly reward is given to men according to the
measure and proportion of their works and labor. His argument is thus to be
framed.

What is given according to the measure and proportion of works, that the
works do merit:

Eternal life is given according to the measure and proportion of works:
therefore works do merit eternal life.

The proposition he proves, because if the reward be given according to the
proportion of works, then there is regard had in giving that reward not only
of the promise, or of the bounty of the rewarder, but also of the dignity of
the works. The assumption he confirm^th by diverse texts of Scripture, as
Psalm. 62. 12. thou shall render to every man according to his works. Mat. 16.
27. The son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his Angels, and
then he shall render to every one according to their works. Luke 6. 38. with
the same measure that you mete, it shall be measured to you again. Romans 2. 6.
who will render to every man according to his works. 1 Cor. 3. 8. every man
shall receive his reward according to his own labor. Gal. 6. 7. what things a
man shall s^w, those also he shall reap. Apoc. 22. 12. Behold I come quickly,
and my reward is with me, to render to every man according to his works.

XI. Before I apply mine answer to the parts of his Syllogism, The answer.
I am to propound a twofold distinction concerning the reward of our
inheritance. First, that it may be considered either as our inheritance, or as
our reward. Secondly, that it may be considered in respect either of the
substance of it, as it is eternal life, or of the degrees of glory therein. As
it is our inheritance, as it is eternal life, it is one and the same equally
given to all that a^e saved, and not given unequally according to the
proportion of our virtues or works. It is one and the same, first, in respect
of the same meritorious cause, which is the merit of Christ. For as by his
righteousness we are equally justified; so by his merits we are equally saved,
equally made partakers of that inheritance, which by the same price of his
m^rits is equally purchased for all that truly believe. Secondly, it is one
and the same objective, in respect of the same object, it being the vision or
fruition of the same God, who is the chief good. Thirdly, in respect of
continuance, in regard whereof it is called eternal life, which is one and the
same to all, being the same everlasting inheritance, and the same ^ternall
fruition of God and Fellowship, which we shall ever have with Christ, and by
him with the whole Trinity. But however eternal life in respect of the
substance be on^ and the same equally procured by the merit of Christ; yet it
is not to be doubted, that there are diverse degrees of glory, where with God
does crown the diverse degrees of grace, which he has bestowed on his children
in this life. For although all that shall be saved shall have fullness of
felicity, so much as they are capable of; yet some are more capable than
others. Even as vessels of diverse measures being put into the sea will all be
f^ll of liquor, according to their capacity; yet some will contain a greater
quantity than others. So all the Saints, though all full of happiness, yet
shall not all be endued with the same measure of glory, but according to their
capacity. This is that which heretofore I alleged out of Vid. Lib. 4. cap.
13.. 2.
S. Ambrose, that god does give to all that are saved, aequalem mercedem vit^,
non gloriae, equal reward of life, not of glory. These things thus premised, I
answer; first, by denying his proposition. For although, according to the
proportion both of habitual grace, and of actual obedience (which we call
good works) the degrees of glory in the life to come shall be bestowed: yet
these degrees are not thereby merited; but God does graciously crown his
greater graces, which he freely bestowed in this life, with a greater measure
of glory in the life to come. Besides, Bellarmin^ and other Papists do teach,
that God crowns our good works supra condignum, therefore those crowns
cannot be merited ex condigno. Secondly, I deny his assumption, averting that
eternal life it self is not bestowed according to the proportion of our
works, but as it is wholly merited by the obedience of Christ; so is it
equally bestowed upon all the faithful, who are equally justified by the
merits of Christ.

XII. But here Bellarmine cavilleth with two answers given, Bellarm. cavils.
as he says, by our Divines, the former, that diverse rewards are given to good
works both in this life and in the world to come, but not eternal life it
self, against which he proves, that good works are rewarded with eternal
life, and that there are no rewards in the world to come, which do not belong
to eternal life. Whereas no doubt the meaning of those, who gave that answer,
was this, that there are diverse degrees of rewards given both in this life, and
in the world to come, as namely the diverse degrees of glory, but there are not
diverse degrees of eternal life, that is one and the same to all that are
saved. We do not deny but eternal life is the reward of good works, and
therefore Bellarmine might have spared his pains in proving that, which we do
not deny; but we deny it to be given in diverse degrees, according to the
proportion of men's works. The other answer, that et^rnall life is to b^ given
to good works, no otherwise b^t as they are signs of faith; which also he
solemnly disputes against, utterly mistaking the matter. For first, we say,
that God does graciously reward the virtues and obedience of his own children,
not as their merits, but as his graces. Secondly, we say indeed, that in the
Gospel eternal life is promised to those that believe without respect of
works, and damnation denounced against those that believe not: but because
both faith and infidelity are inward and hidden, and many deceive themselves
with an inward opinion, and an outward profession of faith: therefore the Lord
at the last day will proceed in judgment, according to the evidence of men's
works. So that the Lord pronounces the sentence, according to works as the
signs and evidence of faith, but rewards both faith and them, as his own
gifts and graces. Howbeit more properly eternal life it self is rendered to
the righteousness of faith, which is the righteousness and merits of Christ
imputed to them that believe, by which the faithful are equally justified, and
equally entitled to the kingdom of heaven; but the degrees of glory are given
according to the degrees of our sanctification, that is, to the degrees both of
the habits of faith and other graces, and of the acts and exercise thereof,
which we call good works. All which, being Gods own free gifts, he does
freely reward, crowning his greater graces, with greater glory.

XIII. As for the places of Scripture which testify that God will reward men
according to their works: I answer, that secundum The places of Scripture
weighed.
opera, according to works, does not signify the proportion, but the quality
of works as I have showed before out of Gregory: Mat. 16. 27.
that is, as in some of the places it is expressed, good works are to Romans 2.
6.
Apoc. 22. 12.
be rewarded with glory, evil with punishment, Romans 2. 6, 7, 8. 2 Cor. 5. 10.
etc. And so is that, Gal. 6. 7. to be understood as the Apostle explaineth
himself, verse. 8. that as every man does sow, so he shall reap: viz. he that
sows to the flesh shall of the flesh reap corruption but he that sows to
the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap ^uk. 6. 38.
everlasting life. The allegation out of Luke 6. 38. is impertinent, as
appears by his parallel, Mat. 7. 1, 2. Judge not, that you be not judg^d: for
with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged, and with what measure you
mete, it shall be measured to you again. For first, it seems to speak of
humane judgment; that as we judge others, so we shall be judged of others,
according to the Lex t^lionis.
law of like for like. Secondly, it speaks of active judging in the worse
sense, which is therefore forbidden; and the reason is from the like judging
passive, Iam. 3. 1.
as an evil, though just reward thereof: so far is it from speaking of the
reward of eternal life. Or if the place should be generally understood of men's
judging well or ill, and of their being judged according, either by God or man;
nothing else can necessarily be gathered, but the like judgment in quality,
that is, either good or bad. 1 Cor. 3. 8.
And the like is to be said of 1 Cor. 3. 8. where the Apostle does not sp^ake
of the eternal reward, either of life or death, rendered to good or evil
works, according to the proportion thereof: but of the blessing of increase,
which God gives to those that are planters or waterers in his garden, as a
reward of their labors. By planters he understands himself and other
Apostles, who were the planters of the Church: by waterers, Apollo and other
Evangelists, and Preachers, who fed the Church with their doctrine. The reward
of their labors (who are Gods workmen, verse. 9. laboring for him, and not
for themselves) is the blessing of increase which God gives thereunto. Even as
the harvest is the reward of the earing, not to be asscribed to the merit of
earing, but to the blessing of God. And so it is here plainly said, though the
Planter and the Waterer shall have their own rewards: yet their reward is not
to be asscribed to the merit of their labor, but to the blessing of God. I
have planted says Paul, and Apoll^ has watered, but God gave the increase. So
then, neither he that planteth is any thing, nor he that waters, but God that
gives the increase: Or if the place should generally be understood o^ all
works both good and bad, the meaning would be, that the reward would be
answerable either good or bad. That of the Psalmist, Psalm. 62. 12. To thee,
Lord, mercy, for thou rendrest to every man according to his work, is not
generally to be understood of the works of all men both good and bad; (for the
bad works of the wicked he does not reward in mercy, but judgment without
mercy shall be executed upon them:) but of the good works of the godly
only, which though they be good and acceptable to Iam. 2. 13.
God in Christ, yet he rewards them not according to merit, but according to
his mercy. The place Ap^c. 22. 12. may be an exposition of the rest. For
whereas in the rest it is said, that God will judge (...) according to their
d^eds, here Christ says, he will render to every one, (...), as his work
shall be, viz. good or bad. But here the Papists would seem to bring a reason
a pari, that as the wicked are damned pr^pter peccata, for their evil works,
so the godly are saved propter opera bona, for their good works. And as ^vill
works merit hell, so good works, pari ratione, merit heaven. Answ. it is
impar ratio: there is no equality in the comparison: For first, the Scripture
plainly teaches, that by and for their evil works men are condemned; and as
plainly denies, that by or for good works men are saved. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9.
Tit. 3. 5. Secondly, any one sin meriteth death, because it is a breach of
the Law, yea, of the whole law, Iam. 2. 10. but not any one good work can
merit heaven, because it is not the fulfilling of the whole law: for there must
be a concurrence of all duties. In so much that if a man should perform all
the Commandments, and fail in one; the breach of that one makes him guilty
of all. Thirdly, evil works are Greg. Moral. lib. ult. cap. ult.
purely and perfectly evil, and therefore absolutely deserve death: but the
good works are not purely and perfectly good, as I have heretofore prooved.
therefore death is the due stipend of sin, but eternal life is the free gift
of God. Fourthly, sin is absolutely meritorious of damnation; but so is not
our obedience of Salvation. For though we could perform all the commandments
by a total, perpetual, and perfect obedience, yet we must acknowledge our
selves unprofitable servants, and much less could we merit thereby, because we
have done but our duty; and where is no more but duty, there can be no
merit. Debitum non est meritum.

XIIII. His third argument is taken from those places which do so testify
eternal life to be rendered to good works, that they place the very reason why
eternal life is given in good works. The places be these, Matthew. 25. 34, 35.
Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess the kingdom prepared f^r you from the
beginning of the world: For I was hungry, and you gave me meat, etc. and in
the same chapter, verse. 21. because thou have been faithful in few things,
etc. Apoc. 7. 14. These are they who came out of great tribulation, etc.
therefore they are before the Throne of God. In which places the particles,
enim, quia, ideo, for, because, therefore, are all causall. His reason stands
thus: To what things the causall particles are applied, they are causes of that
to which they have relation; as namely of Salvation:

To works of charity the causall particles are applied:

Therefore works of charity are causes of Salvation.

To the proposition I answer, that causall particles do not always, nor for
the most part, signify causes so properly called. For that is a gross er^our
of the Papists, as I noted before. The word cause sometimes is used properly to
signify that argument which has relation only to its effect, by virtue
whereof the effect has its being, either as from the efficient, or as of the
matter, or as by the form, or as for the end. Sometimes it is used generally
to signify any argument or reason whatsoever, which is not the cause of the
thing, or of the being of that whereof it is said to be a cause, but of the
consequence or conclusion, and thus the rendering of any reason is called (...)
a rendering of the cause, though perhaps it be from the effect, or any other
argument. And forasmuch as persons are discerned and known by their effects,
(for as our Savior says, By their fruits you shall know them) therefore it is
usual in the Scriptures from the effect to argue and declare the cause: As
thus: God is merciful, for he rewards the godly according to their works.
God is just, for he rewards the wicked according to their sins. This man
is elect, because he truly believes and repents; this man truly believes,
because he is fruitful of good works. This is a good tree, for it brings
forth good fruit. To the woman that was a sinner Luke 7. 47.
much was forgiven for she loved much. In those and infinite more examples the
cause or reason which is rendered is from the effect. Therefore the proposition
is false.

. XV. Now let us consider the places of Scriptnre which he alleges, and
first Matthew. 25. 35. for when I was hungry, etc. This reason, which is
alleged, is not from the cause, as if good works were the meritorious cause
of our inheriting the kingdom of heaven; but from the effect to prove the
cause, which is expressed, Verse 34. as I have showed Lib. 7. cap. 4.. 12. and
cap. 5.. 11.
before: For, for what cause are men to be saved? First, because they are
blessed of the Father, that is justified, and therefore entitled to this
kingdom. Secondly, because they are elected, and therefore this kingdom was
prepared for them from the beginning. Thirdly, because they ar^ the heirs of
God, for whom our Savior purchased this inheritance, noted in the word (...)
i^rit. But how shall it appear, who they are that are blessed and justified,
for whom this kingdom is prepared, for whom this inheritance is purchased? By
the fruits of justification, election, redemption, and namely by the works of
mercy and chari^y toward the poor members of Christ: according to which, as
the evidence, our Savior Christ will judge. And thus his reason stands,
those who are blessed of God, that is, justified; for whom this kingdom wa^
prepared, and this i^heritance purchased, they are to inheri^ this kingdom.

But you are such, as appears by the fruits, for your excercising the works
of charity and mercy toward my poor members and that for my sake, is a plain
evidence of your election, justification and redemption and according to this
evidence I judge of you, come therefore, inherit the kingdom, etc. But to this
allegation I have answered twice Lib. 7. cap. 4.. 12. and cap. 5.. 11.
before.

The second place is out of the same Mat^h. 25. 21.
Chapter, Verse 21. In which there is no causall particle e^pressed in the
original, neither is it any desert, but duty of the servant to be faithful,
neither any debt or duty of his Lord, but his hou^y and largess in rewarding
of his fidelity in few things, with making him ruler over many things.

The third place is Apoc. 7. 14. These (...) ^hey who came out of great
tribulation, etc. therefore they are (...) the Throne of God: In alleging
whereof Bellarmine leaves out that which is most ma^riall, that they had
washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, (...)
therefore they are before the Throne of God, which shows, that they stood
before the Throne of God, not in their own merits, but in the merits of
Christ, by which they were justified. That which is said of their tribulation
does not insinuate their desert, as though thereby they had deserved to be
before the Throne of God, but the order of their afflictions going before their
glorification, and the consecution of eternal life following thereupon; for as
it is said of our Savior, Phil. 2. that he having humbled himself unto death
the Lord did therefore exalt him, Verse 9. and Luke 24. 26. that he was first
to suffer those things, and so to enter into his glory: so of the faithful it
is likewise said, that through much tribulation they must enter into the
kingdom of God, Act. 14. 22. And this is the answer which Calvin Inst. lib.
3. c. 18.. 1.
gives to some of these places, that they signify ordinem consequentiae,
magis quam causam. For whom God ha^h appointed to salvation, for them he has
prepared the way of Ephesians. 2. 10.
ob^dience and Matthew. 7. 14. Act. 14. 22. Heb. 12. 1.
patience, that therein they make walk toward their Country, which is
^eaven; good works therefore and afflictions, are not the cause of salvation,
but the way to it. That good works be causes, Bellarmi^e proves from the
causall particles.


. XVI. But says Bellarmine, Christ could not more plai^ely have expressed,
that good works are the caus^s of salvation, than when he said; for when I
was hungry you did, etc. especi^lly seeing he ^seth the same form of fpeech
against the wicked: for I was hungry, and you did not, etc. In which the cause
of damnation is noted. I answer, that our Savior, if he had meant that good
works are the meri^orious cause of salvation, he was able to have expressed
it in as plain terms as Bellarmine dothBut his intent in these reasons, which
he gives, was not to set down the causes of salvation or damnation, but the
notes and marks of them who are to be saved or condemned, as the evidence,
according to which he pronounces sentence. Yea, but Bellarmine will prove,
that the particles for and because are truly causall. By what reason? Forsooth
by a circular augmentation, bec^se good works are causes. And how did he
prove good works to be causes? Because these particles are causall. To prove
that works be causes, meaning meritorious causes, he alleges three Texts of
Scripture, 2 Cor. 4. 17. Gal. 6. 8. Phil. 2. 12. Two whereof I discussed before
in their due place, where he endeavored to prove that good works a^e necessary
necessitate effici^tiae, as causes of salvation, viz. 2 Cor. 4. 17. lib. 7.
cap. 5.. 7. and of this eighth book, cap. 2.. 21. and Phil. 2. 12. lib. 7.
cap. 5. 5.

That of Gal. 6. 8. he that sows to the Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap
life everlasting, makes against him rath^ than for him. For as in the natural
harvest the increase is not to be ascribed to the ploughing and sowing, but to
the blessing of God: so much more in the spiritual.

. XVII. But that these particles are not always truly and properly These
particles not always causall.
causall Calvin shows by a notable instance. God had promised Abraham when
he first called him out of Vr, that in him, that is, in his seed, all the
nations of the earth should be blessed. This promise the Genesis 12. 1. 3.
Lord often renewed, as appears in his story, which again he confirms by
oath, Genesis 22. 16. 18. When Abraham had upon trial in an excellent manner and
measure approved both his faith and obedience unto God. By my self have I
sworn, says the Lord, that because thou have done this thing, and have not
withheld thy son, thine only son -- in thy seed shall all the nations of
the earth be blessed, because thou have obeyed my voice. Here both in the
beginning of the oath and in the end the causall particle is used, shall we
therefore say, that Abrah^ms obedience did merit that all the nations of the
earth, that is, Abraham himself and all the faithful in all nations should
be blessed in the promised seed? God had long before made this gracious
promise to Abraham, without respect of this or any other his works, and had
this act of obedience never been, the promise of the promised seed in his
posterity would have been performed, so that the grace and love of God was the
only cause, why he promised to send his own Son, who should take on him
the seed of Abraham, and not Abraham's obedience. All that can truly be said
is, that upon this obedience God took occasion to renew his promise, and to
confirm it by oath, for the further confirmation of Abraham's faith. So that
his obedience was so far from being the cause of the thing promised, as it
was but the occasion of renewing the promise. But Bellarmine in this example
mentions only that inferior promise concerning the multiplication of
Abraham's seed, and says, that as God did promise it, so he would have him to
merit it by his good works: even so the Lord having predestined all the
Elect unto Glory, yet his pleasure is, that they should attain unto it by
their own merits. Which clean overthrows the grace of election which which
was without respect of works, and also of salvation. For if our election or
salvation be of works or merits, then is it not of grace. And if this answer
of Bellarmine be good, then may it in like manner be applied Itaque ex eo quod
Deus absolute promisit Abrahae multiplicationem posteritatis (and so
blessedness to all the faithful in his seed) non sequitur ut Abraham eam non
vere mer ^erit, immo sequitur, ut meruerit, cum Deus per ^jusmodi medium
promissio^em suam implere decreverit.
to that part of the Oath concerning the promised seed, namely, that Abraham by
his obedience had merited, that in the promised seed the faithful of all
nations should be blessed, which is no better than blasphemy. It is true that
God has elected us that we might be Ephesians. 1. 4.
holy, and that by the 2 Thessalonians. 2. 13.
sanctification of the Spirit we might be fitted for his kingdom, and receive
the Act. 26. 18.
inheritance among those that are sanctified. And this holiness is so
necessary a property and cognizance of them that shall be saved, as that
without it no man Heb. 12. 14.
shall see God, wherefore though it be not the cause, as I have showed
heretofore, yet it is the way to the Kingdom, and consequently causa sine qu^
non. And therefore that we may be stirred up to seek after holiness which
is so necessary, the Lord in abundant mercy has promised eternal life
thereunto as the reward, whereby he does superaboundantly recompense, all our
service and obedience, and most graciously crown his own gifts and graces in
us. Yea but, says Bellarmine, God in like man^er promised children to ^saack;
yet his pleasure was that he should obtain them by the merit of prayer.
Reply, that a man should merit by prayer, is as absurd, as to imagine, that a
poor man, who has nothing, does by his begging merit alms. It is true, that
when God promises good things unto us, as the end, we are to use those
means, which God h^th preordained (whereof prayer is a principal) and to
walk in that way which leads to that end: but those means are no merits,
nor that way no cause of obtaining that, which God, as he has graciously
promised, so he freely bestows.

. XVIII. The fourth argument is from those testimonies where Bellarmines fourth
argument from the reward rendered in justice.
the reward is said to be rendered to good works out of justice, as 2 Thessalonians.
1. 4. we glory in you in the Churches of God for your patience and faith in all
your persecutions and tribulations which you sustain for an example of the
just judgment of God: and after, verse. 6. If yet it be just with God to repay
tribulation to them that vex you, and to you that are vexed rest with us. 2 Timothy 4. 7, 8. I have fought a good sight, I have consummate my course, I have
kept the faith. Concerning the rest, there is laid up for me a crown of
justice, which our Lord will render to me at that day a just judge. Heb. 6. 10.
God is not unjust, that he should forget your work. Iam. 1. 12. Blessed is
the man that suffers tentation; for when he has been proved he shall
receive the Crown of life. Apoc. 2. 10. Be thou faithful until death, and I
will give thee the Crown of life. Hereto also, says he, belong those places;
Pro. 19. 17. foeneratur Domino he lends, as it were upon usury, to the Lord,
who has pi^y on the poor, 1 Cor. 9, 24. Know you not, the they which run in
the race, all run indeed, but one receives the price? so run, that you may
obtain, 2. Tim. 1. 12. I am sure, that he is able to keep my depositum unto
that day. For he should do wrong, who should either not repay, that which was
lent, or not pay the prize to him that overcommeth, or not restore the
depositum, that is, the thing which is committed to his trust: For all these
include justice. His argument is thus to be framed:

That reward which God in justice renders to good works is merited by them:

Eternal life is a reward which God in justice renders to good works:

Therefore eternal life is merited by them.

The proposition he takes for ^ranted; the assumption he proves by all those
testimonies, which he has alleged.

. XIX. But first I answer to his proposition, by distinguishing The first
answerh to the proposition.
the word justice: which is taken either universally, Deuteronomy. 32. 4. Psalm. 145.
7. Psalm. 11. 7. Romans 9. 14.
comprehending all moral virtues, and so it is all one with Gods goodness,
both as he is good in himself, and as he is good to his creatures,
comprising the bounty, and therein the love the grace and mercy of God, as
well as that which more properly is called his justice. So that what good
things is rendered accor^ing to this justice, is not therefore merited.

More particularly justice is either in word or deed. God is just in his word,
both in respect of his precepts which are just, Psalm. 19 9. Psalm. 19. 137, 138.
as a just Lawgiver, and also in respect of his promises, in performance
whereof he is 1 These. 5. 24.
faithful and Nehem. 9. 8.
just. For it is a just thing for any to stand to his promises, yea, as the
Orator says Cic. de offic.
f^ndamentum est justiti^ fides. Hence in the Scriptures faithful and just are
sometimes joined as synonyma, 1 Ioh. 1. 9 If we confess our sins, he is
faithful and just to forgive us our sins. And in this sense God is said to
be just, when he does render unto us that which he has promised. So in the
places alleged, 2 Timothy 4. 7, 8. Heb. 6. 10. Iam. 1. 12. He is just also in
his works, Psalm. 48. 10. and 145. 17. For God does whatsoever he wills, Ephesians.
1. 11.
and whatsoever he wills, that is just. This justice by Philosophers is
distinguished into distributive and commutative, both observing equality; the
former geometrical; the later arithmeticall. But this distinction does not
agree to the justice of God in respect of the later branch, which consists in
commutation, that is, in mutual giving and receiving. For God gives all
things to all, Act. 17. 25. but receives not any thing from any. Romans 11. 35*
as I have said before, and therefore cannot be a debtour to any, but to
himself in regard o^ his promise. Thus then the justice of God, which is in
fact, may more fully be distinguished: that it is either disponens, or
remunerans, disposing, either as a just, but most free and absolute Lord of
all; or as he is the just God, the Creator, Governor, and Preserver of all
things. Remunerating, as he is the just judge. As a most free and absolute
Lord, he disposes things according to his absolute will and pleasure. Who
possessing Genesis 14. 22.
all things by full and absolute right, may according to his pleasure dispose
of them, doing with his own what he pleases, Romans 9. 18, 21. Matthew. 20. 15.
As he is the just God, that is the Creator, Preserver and Governor of all,
he disposes of all things according to his goodness, Mat. 5. 45. 48. giving
all good things to all, not universa singulis, but such as are agreeable and
fitting to all, according to their several kind, nature, and quality. And from
this justice the order of the whole Universe depends. This goodness os God
sometimes in the Scripture is called his justice, Psalm. 116. 5. and so
translated by the 72. Genesis 19. 19. and 32. 10. Exodus 34. 7. Esai. 63. 7. and
this justice is by the said 72. rendered mercy. Deuteronomy. 6. 25. and 24. 13. Psalm.
24. 5. and 33. 5. and 103. 6. Esai. 1. 27. Dan. 4. 24. and 9. 16. And as he is
God of all and just to all in giving to all those good things which belong to
them: so is he after a more peculiar manner the God of the faithful, Genesis 17.
7. even the God of their righteousness, Psa. 4. 1. as their justifier and
Savior, by the righteousness of God 2 Pet. 1. 1.
and our Savior Jesus Christ, by imputation whereof he is just in justifying
us, Romans 3. 25, 26. and in remitting our sins, Psalm. 51. 14. 1 Ioh. 1. 9. and
accepting of us as righteous in Christ unto eternal life: and to this justice
of Christ and not to ours, does the Lord in justice, as a just Judge, render
eternal life, being no less just than merciful in saving us. And in this
justice of God as well as his mercy* are we to repose our affiance, both for
our justification and salvation. For if we truly believe in Christ, we have
in him satisfied Gods justice, in him we have fulfilled the Law, and therefore
remission of sins and eternal life is in justice due unto us, not for any
merits of ours, but for the merits of Christ. There remains the remunerating
or distributive justice of God, as a just Judge judging the world in
righteousness, Psalm. 9. 4, 8. and rendering to every one according to the
quality of their works Psalm. 62. 12. Romans 2. 6. Ier. 32. 19. For it is just
with God to reward the righteousness of the righteous, and to punish the
sins of the wicked, as in the place alleged, 2 Thessalonians. 1. 5, 6. and Psalm. 18.
20, 24. Mat. 10. 41, 42. 2 Timothy 4. 8. Exodus 34. 7. And this justice is
distinguished according to the qua^ity of the persons toward whom it is
exercised: for toward the godly it is justitia liberans and beans, of which
Psa. 31. 1. and 71. 2. deliver me in thy righteousness: and toward the wicked
vindicans or puniens, Psalm. 94. 1, 2. Exodus 34. 7. (...). 1. 2, 3.

The proposition therefore is not true, unless it be understood of
commutative justice, which belongs not to God. For the reward which God
gives to good works, if it be according to his universal justice; it is to
be ascribed not to our merits, but to his goodness. If according to his
justice in word; not to our merits, but to his fidelity. If according to his
justice, as he is absolute Lord; not to our merits but to his good pleasure. If
according to his justice, as he is Creator, etc. not to our merits but to his
bounty. If according to his justice, as he is the God of our righteousness;
not to our merits, but to the merits of Christ. If according to his
remunerating justice; not to our merits, but to his liberality.

Answ. 2. God may be said in justice to render reward, either in respect of
the worthiness or desert of the work, or in some other respect: If not in
that respect, or if in any other respect, it argues not merit. But not in that
respect, for all our works are unperfect and stained with the flesh, and no
way in worth comparable to the reward: but in other respects, as first in
regard of his promise, which it is just with him to perform: secondly, in
regard of Christ's merit applied to us.

. XX. I come to the assumption, which understood of commutative The
alleagedplaces examined.
justice, is not true: of others, it is to no purpose. Let us then examine his
proofs: whereof not one does prove the question. For as touching the first,
viz. 2 These. 1. 6. we have said, that it is just in respect 1.
of Gods remunerative justice, by which he renders to every one according to
the quality of their works, to recompense tribulation to the wicked, which
persecute the Church: and to the godly who are troubled, rest with the Saints.
The second, 2 Timothy 4. 7* 8. It 2.
is just with God, when the faithful have fought a good fight, have finished
their course, have kept the faith, that he should render unto them the crown
of righteousness, both according to his fidelity in performing his promise
(for it is just, that the crown, which he has promised to the faithful, he
should give them having kept the faith: and also according to that
righteousness, as he is the God of our righteousness, that is, the justifier
and Savior of all that believe. For it is just, that the righteous judge
should give to the Apostle, having kept the faith, that crown of
righteousness, which God has promised, and which Christ has purchased, and
which in respect of Christ his merit and righteousness imputed, is in justice
due, not only to the Apostle, but to all the faithful, who are described by
this note, that they love his coming. If it be demanded, why it is called the
crown of righteousness, De gratia and lib. arb.
Bernard shall inform us. Est ergo quam Paulus expectat corona justi^iae; sed
justitiae Dei, non suae. It is therefore a crown of justice which Paul
expects, but of Gods justice, not his own. For it is just, that he should
render what he owes, and he owes what he has promised. And this is the
justice, whereof the Apostle presumes, the promise of God. The third, Heb. 6.
10. 3.
God having promised, that he would be Esai. 49. 15, 16.
mindful of his servants, he is not unfaithful to break his promise, nor
unjust to forget them. But what is this to the purpose? or that which
follows, Iam. 1. 12. 4.
that when a man is by bearing affliction found to be (...) approved, he shall
receive the crown of life, which God has promised to all that love him: or
that Apoc. 20. 10. where to him that is faithful unto 5.
death, the Lord promises to give, out of his gracious bounty, a crown of
life.

As touching those places, which concern loan, the prize and the depositum;
in all three it is presupposed in the very nature of the contracts, that a
promise is made by the borrower, by the master of the game, by the depositary,
that the thing borrowed is at the day of payment to be restored, the prize is to
be given to him that wins it, and the depositum is to be rendered when the
depositor does demand it: and therefore that it is just that the promise in
every one should be performed. And even so 2 Timothy 1. 12.
Paul in the last place, as De* gra^ia and lib. arb.
Bernard has well observed, Dei promissum suum appellat depositum, and quia
credidit promittenti, fiden^er promissum repe^it; promissum quidem ex
misericordia, sed jam ex justitia persolvendum: calls Gods promise or that
which he promised, his depos^um, and because he believed the promiser, he does
confidently call for the thing promised; promised indeed in mercy, but now in
justice to be rendered.

. XXI. His fifth argument is taken from those Testimonies His fifth ^rgument
that life is promised on condition of works.
wherein eternal life is promised to good works, as Ma^th. 19. 17. If thou will enter into life, keep the Commandments, and verse. 29. Every one that
shall leave house or father, etc. he shall receive an hundred fold, and shall
possess eternal life, 1. Tim. 4. 8. Godliness is profitable for all things,
having the promise of this life, and of that which is to come, Iam. 1. 12. he
shall receive the crown of life, which God has promised to them that love
him. Now, says he, a promise made with the condition of a work, does not
only make the thing promised a debt (for he that promised is bound to stand to
his promises) but also causes, that he who shall fulfill the work, may be
said to have merited the thing promised, and may by right require it as his
reward. His reason briefly is this: Eternal life is promised upon condition of
good works: therefore good works are meritorious of eternal life.

I deny the consequence: though eternal life be promised upon condition of
good works, yet good works are not the meritorious cause thereof.

First, The reasons of my denial are these: first, because eternal life,
before we had a being, was freely intended to all of us that shall be saved,
not according to our works, but according to Gods own purpose and grace which
was given us in Christ Jesus before all secular times, 2 Timothy 1. 9.

Secondly, Because Christ has merited it for all the elect: and there is no
other meritorious cause of salvation besides him.

Thirdly, Because in Christ it is freely promised to all the faithful, as
their inheritance purchased by Christ, and therefore not to be obtained by
their own merit.

Fourthly, As it was a reward freely promised, so it is freely given, as (...),
as the free gift of God.

Fifthly, Because, as it self is the free gift of God, so the graces and good
works to which it is promised as a reward, are the free gifts of God; of which
the more we have, the more are we indebted to God: so sarre are we from
meriting any thing at the hands of God by them.

Sixthly, Because all our works are debita debts or duties, which we owe unto
God: and therefore when we have done all, we must say, we are unprofitable
servants.

Seventhly, Because there can be no merit of condignity, where is not an
equal proportion between the work and the reward.

Eighthly, Because our best works are stained with the flesh.

Ninthly, Because God is our absolute Lord, and we are his bondservants: to
whom we owe our selves and whatsoever we can do: Neither are we able to
render unto him so much as is due, and much less can we merit any thing from
him.

Tenthly, Because God to all his creatures gives all Act. 17. 25.
good things, but receives Romans 11. 35.
nothing from any, and therefore cannot be made a debtour to any of his
creatures.

Therefore though eternal life be promised to good works, yet it is not
merited by them.

Yea but says Bellarmine, the promise made with a condition of works does
make the thing promised due. Answ. First, where the condition is fully
performed, there the thing promised is due. But we all fail in the
fulfilling. And therefore if reward be given to such as come short of their
duty, as all do, it must be acknowledged to be of Gods grace, and not of our
merit. Secondly, the thing promised is due not by merit but by promise, not in
^espect of the work done, which is a duty, and that not so perfectly
performed, but that it needs pardon, but only in respect of the promise:
because he who has promised has bound himself to keep his promise. But
Gods promise was d^ gratuit^ non de debito, I say, his promise was freely to
give eternal life, and so according to his promise he freely bestows it. Yea
but, says he, by performing the condition not only the thing promised
becomes due; but he also that has performed, may truly be said to have
merited the reward promised. But this, say I, should have been proved, and not
taken for granted, being denied by us, and disproved by all the ten arguments
even now produced.

. XXII. His sixth argument is taken from those places wherein ^ellarmines sixth
argument from those places which mention worthiness.
mention is made of dignity or worthiness. For as before he had said in his
second Chapter, to be worthy of reward, and to merit it is all one, according
to that saying of our Savior, Luke 10. 7. the labourer is worthy of his hire.
The places are these, Wisd. 3. 5. God proved them and found them worthy of
himself, 2 These. 1. 5. that you may be counted worthy of Gods kingdom, for
which also ye suffer, Luke 20. 35. They that shall be accounted worthy of that
world, and the resurrection from the dead. Apoc. 3. 4. they shall walk with me
in whites because they are worthy. His reason may thus be framed: whosoever
are worthy of eternal life they do merit or deserve it.

Those that do good works are worthy of eternal life: Therefore they do
merit or deserve it. I answer by distinction. For there is difference between
these two, to be worthy, and to be counted worthy, (...) and (...) or (...), to
be worthy by a man's own worth or merit, or by acceptance and grace or favor
vouchsafed by another to be esteemed worthy: to be worthy in our selves, or to
be accepted as worthy in Christ. If the word be understood in the former sense,
I deny the assumption: if in the latter, I deny the proposition. For to be
worthy, or rather to be accounted worthy of eternal life by mercy and grace,
not dignitate sua, sed dignatione divina, not in themselves, but in Christ,
which is the case of all the faithful: and yet to merit and to deserve it by a
man's own worth, implies a contradiction.

Against the assumption I say, that none of the faithful, though fruitful of
good works, is in himself, or by his own worth or merit worthy of eternal
life. This has been the confession of the faithful in all ages, as I partly
noted before. Jacob confesses, Genesis 32. 10. that he was less than the least
of Gods mercies, that is, unworthy of them, though but temporal; what would he
have said of eternal? David professes himself unworthy of those temporal
honors which God had vouchsafed unto him, 2 Samuel 7. 18. 1 Chronicles. 29. 14. John
the Baptist confesses, that he was not worthy to carry Christ's shoes, Mat. 3.
11. or to loose the latchet of them, Luke 3. 16. John 1. 27. The Centurion,
whose faith is so highly commended, professes himself not to be worthy, that
Christ should come under his roof, Mat. 8. 8. The afflictions of this life,
though one man did bear them all, are not worthy of the future glory, Roman.
8. 18. Add to these the confessions of the Fathers, though cited, many of
them, before. In Psalm. 118. ^ sermon. 20.
Ambrose: Quid p^ssumus dignum pramiis facere coelestibus.

In Esai. l. 6. in cap. 13. 7.
H^erome: Nullum opus dignum Dei justitia reperietur. Again, In Romans 8. 18.
Rever a nihil posset (...) condignum pati gl^ria coelesti, etianisi talis
esset illa, qualis modo est vita.

In Colos. hom. 2.
(...): No man shows forth such a conversation, as to be worthy of the
Kingdom of Heaven. No De compunct. ad stelecli.
though a man should die ten thousand deaths, and should perform all virtuous
actions.

The Author of the work not finished upon Homil. 53.
Matthew, what do we in this world, worthy that we may deserve to be made
partakers of our Lord in the heavenly Kingdom? Therefore the Apostle rightly
says, I reckon, that the sufferings of this time are not worthy of the future
glory.

In altercatione cum Diabol^.
Bernard: Fateor non sum dignus ego, nec propriis possum meritis regnum
obtinere coelorum. and elsewhere, In Dedic. eccles. ser^. 5.
Nihil sumus in cordibus nostris; forte in cord Dei potest aliud latere de
nobis. Lege homo in cord tuo, lege intra teipsum de teipso testimonia
veritatis; etiam hac communi luce judicabis te indignum.

Again, Ibid.
Nos sumus (sponsa Dei) sed in cord Dei. Nos sumus, sed ipsius dignatione, non
dignitate nostra -- quod etsi n^s puerili animositate gratis servari nolumus,
merito non salvamur. excludit miseriae dissimulatio miserationem: nec dignatio
locum habet, ubi fuerit praesumptio dignitatis.

The faithful indeed are digni worthy, as it is said Apoc. 3. 4. Sap. 3. 5.
but it is dignatione divina, non dignitate sua: worthy, not in themselves, but
in Gods acceptance in Christ: even as they are just, not in themselves, but in
Christ, 2 Cor. 5. 21. Augustine, In Psalm. 43. 26.
Propter nomen tuum, h. e. gratis; propter nomen tuum, non propter meritum
meum, quiatu dignatus es facere, non quia ego dignus cui facias. And this is
signified in the places alleged, Luke 20. 35. 2 Thessalonians. 1. 5. which speak not
of being worthy, but of being accounted worthy in Gods acceptance.

To the proposition I answer, that they who are worthy, not in themselves but
in Christ, not in respect of their own dignity, but of Gods dignation (which
is the case of all the faithful) though they be accounted worthy of eternal
life, yet they do not merit it themselves; but the merit of Christ is imputed
unto them, which excludes our merit. To that of Luke 10. 7. and likewise 1 Timothy 5. 18. The workman is worthy of his hire; has place among men, who can
deserve and earne their wages one of another, so that the one be not the
bond-servant of the other, but Gods workmen, of whom those places speak,
though they deserv^ their hire of them among whom they labor; yet cannot,
being not their own men, but the bondservants of God, deserve any thing at his
hands. Again, even among men the labourer is not worthy of his hire, who has
but begun and not perfected his work: but our obedience, our righteousness,
our charity, whereby we serve God, is but inch^ata, non perfecta justitia.

XXIII. His seventh argument is taken from those places Bellarmines seventh
argument, because God is a righteous Judge.
where it is said, that God is a righteous judge, and no accepter of persons,
as Romans 2. 11. Gal. 2. 6. 1 Pet. 1. 17. Act. 10. 34. but acception of persons
is a vice contrary to distributive justice, viz. when a judge gives reward
without merits, or a greater reward to less merits, or a less reward to
greater merits. God therefore in the retribution of rewards considers the
merits of men, and according to the diversity of merits he assigns the
mansions of eternal life. This argument, if it shall conclude the question,
must thus be framed: If God do render to men the rewards of eternal life,
neither without their merits, nor greater rewards to less, nor less to
greater merits; than God in the retribution of rewards considers the merits
of men; and consequently the good works of the faithful are meritorious of
eternal life: but the antecedent is true, therefore the consequent. The
assumption he proves, because the contrary is repugnant to distributive
justice. Thus therefore he proves it. If God do render rewards to men without
their merits, or greater rewards to less merits, or less rewards to greater
merits, then is he an unjust judge, and an accepter of persons (which God
forbid.)

But God is a righteous judge, and no accepter of persons, as is proved by the
testimonies alleged: therefore he does not render to men rewards without their
merits, neither does he give greater rewards to less, nor less rewards to
greater merits. Answ. I deny the assumption of the former syllogism, and the
proposition of the second. The assumption was, that God does not render to men
rewards of eternal life without their merits, etc. For that God does give the
reward of eternal life to some, at the least, without their merits, it is
evident in the elect infants, who having no merits of their own, are saved
only by the merits of Christ. And the like is to be said of all other
believers, for whom our Savior by his merits has purchased everlasting life.
Therefore that assumption is so far from being true, that the contrary
thereof is always true, viz. that God does give the reward of eternal life,
as his free gift to all that are saved without any merit of theirs. Neither is
there any other merit of eternal life but the merit of Christ, which is more
than sufficient for all that believe.

The proposition of the prosyllogisme has two branches in both the parts
thereof, of both which I deny the consequence, for as touching the first,
although God do render to men the reward of eternal life without their
merits, yet he is not an unjust Judge. For though they have no merit of their
own, yet they have the all-sufficient satisfaction, and the infinite merit of
Christ, unto which eternal life is in justice due. For the second: Although
the Lord should give greater rewards to less offices and graces, and less to
greater, yet were he not unjust, nor an accepter of persons. For by the
parable of the workmen, Mat. 20. We learn, that the Master of the vineyard,
though he gave the day-penny to them that wrought but one hour, which was as
much as he gave them that wrought twelve hours, yet was not unjust therein. For
in that which is free, and merely of grace, there is no injustice nor
acception of persons. Indeed where the wages or hire is to be rendered (...) as
deserved and earned by the workemens labors, it is to be distributed
according to distributive justice. But where the reward is free and of grace,
the rewarder may do with his own what Matthew. 20. 15.
pleases him: GOD especially, to whom, in all things whatsoever he does, his
will is the rule of justice.

XXIV. To these heretical premises Bellarmine adds a suitable Bellar.
cololary, that we^, who deny merits, deny the article of the last Judgment.
Epist. 46. ad Valentinum.
corollary: wherein there is more malice than might. Therefore (says he)
Augustine says well: If there be no merits how shall God judge this world:
wherefore the heresy of our adversaries which takes away merits, does also
take away the article of faith concerning the future judgem^nt. Answ. Augustine
by merits understands works which are to be rewarded, both the good works
of the godly, proceeding from grace sanctifying and helping the Will, which he,
though unproperly, calls their merits: and also the evil works of the
wicked proceeding from their free will not freeed by grace, which also he
calls, and that properly, their merits. For whereas there were two sorts of
men living in the Monastery of Retract. l. 2. c. 66, 67. ep. 46, 47. lib.
degrat. and li. arbitr. lib. de corrept. and gratia.
Adrumetium (whereof Valentinus was, to whom he writes) who ran into contrary
extremes: the one, so holding free will that they denied grace; the other, so
holding grace that they denied free will; and which was worse, said, that at
the day of judgment God is not to render to every man according to his works:
Augustine writes against both. Si non est Dei gratia, quomodo salvat mundum?
et si non est liberum arbitrium quomodo judicat mundum. If Gods grace be not;
how does he save the world? and if there be no free will, how does he judge
the world? and afterward in the place, which Bellarmine cites, having denied
against the Pelagians, that grace is given according to merits; he adds
these words, Non qui^ nullum est meritum, vel bonum piorum, vel malum impiorum,
ali^quin quomodo judicabit Deus mundum? not because there is no merit, either
good of the godly, or bad of the wicked, otherwise how shall God judge the
world? That is, if there be no works to be rewarded, neither good with
bliss, nor bad with punishment, how shall God judge the world? But we
acknowledge, that God will render to every man according to his works,
rewarding the good works of the godly (which are unproperly called merits,
both themselves, and their reward being the free gifts of God) with eternal
life, and the evil works of the wicked (which properly are called their
merits) with everlasting death. So far are we, through Gods grace, from
denying that article of the future judgment, whereof the Pope and the Papists
se^me to make but a mockery; he granting, and they accepting, or defending his
grant of indulgences and pardons for many thousands of years; whereby is
presupposed, that the day of judgment may perhaps be so long differred. For
at the day of judgment, when all shall be adjudged to eternal, either life,
or death, purgatory shall be at an end, as themselves teach; and together with
Purgatory the use of pardons ends.

CAP. VI. The Testimonies of the Fathers alleged by Bellarmine De just. l. 5.
c. 4.
answered.
. I.

NOw I come to his allegation of the Fathers. But In what sense the Fathers use
the word ^erit.
before I examine the particular testimonies, I am to admonish the Reader, that
he have an eye to the point in question. For that the Latin Fathers do often
use the terms of merit or meriting, we do acknowledge, but without any
advantage to the Papist. For the Papist uses the words in the proper sense,
for deserving and desert. But merits with the Fathers signify no more but good
works, or at the most good works, which God will reward: that is, either
simply good works, or with relation to reward. And the Verb t^ merit, besides
the general sense of obtaining, or finding favor, which is very frequent,
they use it more particularly for doing works of grace which God will
graciously reward. In which senses the use of the words, though unproper, were
not to be misliked in the Fathers, were it not that the after-writers have
taken occasion thereby to use the words properly, for deservnig, and desert,
and that in justice for the works sake, as well in good works, as in bad. I
mean, that good works do as truly and as properly deserve eternal life, as
evil works deserve everlasting death, which was not the meaning of the
Fathers; who meant not, that a man does deserve those good things at the hands
of God, which by them he is said to have merited. If therefore his allegation
be of merits and meriting used by the Fathers in the former, that is, the
unproper senses, as indeed they are, he shall prove nothing, but that the
Fathers do not dissent from us. And if they serve not to prove, either that
the works of grace in themselves do merit, that is, deserve eternal life, as
the meritorious causes thereof: or that Christ has by his merits made them
meritorious, then do they not at all make for the Papists against us. But I am
confident, that they are not able to produce any one pregnant testimony of the
ancient Fathers, affirming, either that our good works do truly and
properly, that is condignely merit eternal life: or that Christ has merited
for our works that they might be meritorious of everlasting life.

II. He begins with the Greek Fathers, of whom he cites Greek Fathers.
Ignatius in Epist. ad Romanos.
eight. The first is, Ignatius: Sinite me ut bestiarum esca sim, per quam
possim Deum promereri. Here Bellarmine for a poor shift is feign to make use
of a corrupt Latin Translation, as it were a puddle, leaving the fountain and
the purer streams. The original is, (...), suffer me that I may become the
food of wild beasts, by whom I may obtain God. And so their own Vairlemius
translateth, Sin^e me ferarum escam fieri, per quas licebit Deum adipisci. But
the same Latin Inter (...). page 98.
Translatour doting, as it seems, upon his Helena of merit, more than once
or twice in that Epistle, uses the word merear, that I may merit, where the
Greek is (...), that I may find, enjoy, obtain, and in the first sentence of
the Epistle twice, Deprecans Deum obtinui ut videre merear dignos vultus
vestros sicut plurimum optabam promereri. The Greek is (...), which Vairlemius
renders thus, Deprecatus Deum obtinui, ut viderem divinas vestras facies, quas
plurimum expetebam. And in the third sentence, for (...) Si modo gra^iam
consequar, the Latin Translatour, whom Bellarmine follows, reads, Si
quidem per gra^iam meruero. And in the next sentence, for (...) De^m asseq^i,
he reads, Deum promereri. And in the next, where Ignatius says, I shall not
have the like opportunity (...) Deum assequendi, of attaining to God, he
reade^h, ut Deum promeruissem, five times in the five first sentences. I omit
the rest. But how little Ignatius favored the proud and Antichristian conceit
of merits, may appear by that which follows in the same Epistle. Now being
bound in him I lea ne to covet no wo^ldly nor vain thing. By sea and land even
from Syria to Rome I fight with beasts, being night and day bound to ten
Leopards, which is a guard of Soldiers, who by benefits become worse. But I by
their injuries am more instructed. Notwithstanding (...).
I am not hereby justified.

The second is Justin Martyr, Homines qui dignos se Dei voluntate and 2. Justin
Martyr, Apolog. 2. an^e medium.
consilio operibus praestiterint, cum eo victuros esse meritis suis sumpsimus,
ac regnatur os sicut ab o^ni interitu perturbationeque sint liberi. Where
Bellarmine again makes use of a corrupt translation, the Greek Text is this;
(...). Where, having said that God has created all things for men, adds:
who, if by their works shall show themselves worthy his will (or to his will)
we have received (or learned) that they are vouchsafed (or accounted worthy
of) conversation with him, reigning together with him made incorruptible and
impassible. Here in stead of being vouchsafed or deemed worthy his (that is)
Gods conversation or fellowship, viz. in heaven, where they shall reign with
him without corruption or passion, he absurdly reads, they shall live and
reign with him by their merits.

The third is Irenaeus, Let us think that crown precious, which is 3.
Irenaeus. lib. 4. cap. 72.
gotten by conflict or contending for it, and comes not unto us of it own
accord, that is, without seeking. And by how much the more it comes unto us
by striving or contending for it, by so much it is the more precious.

Not that contention or conflict is the meritorious cause of eternal life, but
the way to heaven, Luke 13. 24. Matthew. 7. 14. Act. 14. 22. and the means to
victory, to which God has promised freely to give a crown of life, Iam. 1.
12. Apoc 2. 7. 10. 17. Bellarmines reference of his Reader to the forty fourth
Chapter, is but to make him lose his labor.

The fourth is Origin, whom Bellarmine falsifieth, reading pro meritis, Origin*
in Romans 2. lib. 2.
in stead of pro operibus. I will recite the whole place. Nunc requiramus de
justo judicio Dei, in quo reddet unicuique secundum opera sua. Et primo guidem
excludantur haeretici, qui dicunt animarum nature as bonas vel malas: and
audiant, non quia pro natura unicuique Deus sed pro operibus suis (pro meritis
suis, says Bellarmine) reddit. Secundo in loco aedificentur fideles, ne putent
sibi hoc solum sufficere posse quod credant, sed sciant justum judicium Dei
reddere secundum opera. Where if he will needs read pro meritis, in st^ad of
the Apostles words, on which Romans 2. 6.
Origin writes, (...) yet according to that Latin translation he expounds
the words twice secundum opera, retaining the words of the Apostle.

The fifth is Basil, for as for Clemens Alexandrinus, and such other
testimonies Basil.
of the Fathers, as Bellarmi^e does but point at, I mean not to trouble my
self with the search of them. For if they had said any thing for him to better
purpose than those which he does cite; I presume he would have recited their
words, being forced to such poor shifts, even in those whom he does cite.

Out of Basil, he cites two testimonies: the former, De Spiritu sancto. cap.
24.
Homo exjustitiae operibus salvatur, which words, as Bellarmine cites them,
directly contradict the Doctrine of the holy Ghost, who says, that a man is
not saved by the works of righteousness, Tit. 3. 5. Ephesians. 2. 8, 9. Yea, of
Basil himself in other places, as in Psalm. 114* and in Psalm. 32. before cited.
But indeed the words are these, (...). As though a man saved by his works of
righteousness were far from bereaving the holy Ghost of his due glory, which
censure let the Papists, who look to be saved by their works, apply to
themselves. For if the words were, as he cites them, they would further
Erasmus his censure, In Epist. dedicat. ad Episc. Culmens.
that this part of that book is not Basils.

The other testimony is this, Homil. in initium, Prove.
Omnes qui viam evangelicam incedimus mercatores sumus, per oper a mandatorum
nobis possessionem coelestium comparantes. Here also Bellarmines relief is in
the translation, as shall appear by recital of the place. The kingdom of
heaven, says he, out of Matthew. 13. 45. is like a Merchant man, (...). All we
therefore who go the way of the Gospel are Merchants* gaining to ourselves
the possession of heavenly (gifts or goods) by the traffic or negotiation of
the Commandments. It behooves us therefore to gather much and manifold
heavenly riches, where, by heavenly things he does not mean the heavenly
joys or glory of heaven, but heavenly gifts and graces in this life, which in
the words following he calls heavenly wealth. Neither does he speak of
purchasing the real possession of heaven by the works of the Commandments,
but of gaining spiritual and heavenly gifts, (...), by exercising the trade,
or by the gain (for that is the (...). of Merchants and Trades^ men, Mat^h.
25. 16. Act. 19. 25.) Of Gods Commandments both Legal and Evangelicall, which
is a rich sto^ke, for in the keeping of them there is great reward, and by
employing the Talents which God has committed unto us, that we should (...)
trade with them, Matthew. 25. 16. and by trading with them gain unto our selves
a treasure of heavenly riches. For as our Savior says, Matthew. 25. 19. Habenti
dabitur, and exuberabit: habenti, that is, to him tha^ imployeth his gifts, and
tradeth with them it shall be g^ven and he shall abound. For those that
exercise the trade of Gods Commandments being rich in good works, they do,
as the Apostle says, 1 Timothy 6. 18, 19.
treasu^e up to themselves a good foundation, that is, assurance of eternal
life, for so he says, that they may lay hold on eternal life, viz. by the
^ssurance or Plerophory of faith and hope. For by being rich in good works men
do make their 2 P^t 1. 10.
calling and election sure, and so are Romans 8. 24.
saved in hope. But that we should purchase the real possession of the
heavenly kingdom by the works of the Law, which Christ alone has purchased
for us, were little better than blasphemy, from which Saint Basil is sree. And
that this, which I have delivered, was Basils meaning, appears by that which
follows. For after he had said, that we must gather heavenly wealth, he
adds, if we would not be ashamed at the showing (...) of our negotiation, as
those Matthew. 25, 26.
who had received the Talents; nor hear, t^ou wicked and slothful servant,
but having laid up our wares (which before he called heavenly riches) to
endeavor to pass through this life safely and securely. And this further
appears by the whole discourse. For having said before the words alleged,
that to our navigation in this life; the gift of governing, as it were, of our
ship is necessary, for we are all Merchants, etc. for says he, in the next
words after those which I alleged last, many who from their youth have
gathered geat store (namely of that heavenly wealth) in the middle of their
life for the want of the skill of governing, and not able to withstand the
tempests of temptations have made shipwreck, which says he, is a miserable
spectacle, (...), etc. That he who has prospered in the negotiation of the
Commandments should become like a Merchant of great wealth, who glorying in
the multitude of his wares, his ship also failing wi^h a prosperous wind, and
having passed the dreadful seas, at length suffering shipwreck at the very
haven, is at once deprived of all.

The sixth is Chrysostom, If God be just, he will render both to the
Chrysostom. De Lazar^ Hom. 4.
godly and to the wicked according to theirmerits. But if he will render both
to the one and the other according to their merits, and in this life neither
d^e receive, neither the one the punishment of wickedness, nor the other the
reward of virtue: it is manifest, that there remains another time, in which
they shall have either of them a convenien^ reward. Here also the force of
Bellarmines argument is in the translation. For the words, which twice he
translateth pro merit^s, are (...) according to their worthiness, which is of
a larger extent than merit. Now men are said to be worthy either of eternal
punishment, and that in and of themselves by their sins; or of eternal life,
but not of or in themselves, but in Christ, and by grace, God accepting of them
in Christ's worthiness, his merits being imputed to them without any merit of
their own. And thus God will repay the wicked for their demerits, and reward
the godly according to their worthiness, which stands not in dignitate sua,
but in dignatione divina, as I have said before. Howbeit, his meaning in this
place by (...) is all one, as I suppose, with (...), that is, according to the
quality of their works; that is to say, rendering damnation to the wicked, and
salvation to the godly. For so in the words going before, he says, that the
godly shall receive (...) the rewards of their virtue, and the wicked (...) and
in the allegation it self he explaneth what he means by (...), to wit,
that the wicked shall receive (...) the punishment of their wickedness, and
the godly, (...) the rewards of their virtue.

The seventh is Gregory Nazianzen: Creed resurrectionem, judicium, Nazianzen.
Orat. in S. Baptism.
mercedem, adjustum Dei lancem exigendam. The words are (...). Besides these
articles of the Christian faith, receive the resurrection, judgment,
remuneration by Gods just balance. What is that balance, but the righteous Will
of God, which is the rule and standard of all justice, which will render to
every one according to their works, that is to say, to the wicked everlasting
death, and to the godly eternal life. But merit of condignity was no point of
his faith.

The eighth is Gregory Nissen: Denique pro suis quemque meritis ornatum ^regory
Nyssen. orat. de pauper. amandis.
cerno. Gregory in that place deciphereth the judgment to come. And having
described the Judge, and them that are to be judged; I hear, says he, the
speech as of the Judge, and their answers: then follows, (...) which are the
words which Bellarmine cites, and import no more but this, that he
distributed to every one fitting rewards: which he does particularize in the
words following to them that have led a godly life, the fruition of the
Kingdom; but to the inhumane and wicked, the punishment of fire, and that
everlasting. And these were his Greek Fathers, whose learned judgments he
has not alleged, but for the most part, the popish conceits of their partial
translatours.

. III. Of the Latins he cites eleven Fathers. To whose test imonies, The
Latin Fathers.
if it be remembered that they use not the word, meriting, for justly
deserving, but either for obtaining and finding favor to obtain, or for doing
that which God will accept and reward; or the word, merits, in the better
sense, properly for such works as do truly and condignely merit or deserve;
but only for good works, either simply, or with relation to a free reward,
that is. for such good works as God will freely reward, it will not be hard to
answer. Neither will the Papists, as I suppose, be ever able to allege any
one pregnant testimony where the word is used in the Popish ^ense, for that
which truly, properly, and condignely deserves a reward to be rendered in
justice for the works sake. Neither do we deny merits in the sense of the
Fathers, but confess that the good works of the faithful are such, as God
accepts ^o reward them. And so Vega defines merit; the name of merit, says
he IOpuscul. qu. 4.
is restrained to those works which God accepts to some reward. And so
Augustine uses the word, as Bellarmine confesses, De gratia and lib. (...).
l. 1. c. 14.. (...) esse, (...).
to signify any good act for which we receive any other thing.

But let us briefly examin^ the particulars. And first the testimony of
Tertullian* which, as he alleges, it is to me a riddle. De (...) rect.
carnis. cap. 48.
Or^o meri^orum dispositorum nomine disponetur: merita autem cum corpori quoque
ads^ribantur, ordo quoque corpor^m disponatur necesse est, ut possit esse
meritorum: which I cannot assoile, though I should read with Pamelius, Ordo
enim non al^ud quam meritorum dispositor, unless we understand the word
merits not actively for good works meriting or obtaining, but passively for
the rewards obtained. For actively merits cannot be attributed to the body*
which cannot produce any act of freewill, and therefore cannot according to the
doctrine of the Papists, merit. But the rewards are attributed as well to the
body as to the soul, and from thence he proves the resurrection of the body,
out of 1 Cor. 15. 23.

The second is Cyprtan, out of whom he cites two testimonies. The Cyprian.
former De unitate Ecclesiae.
just^tia opus est* ut promereri quis possit Deum, that a man may obtain Gods
favor there is need of justice: we must obey his precepts and monitions, ut
accipiant me^ita nostra mercedem, that our good works may receive the reward,
which God has promised. The other testimony De Opere and El^mos.
is the last sentence of his Book de opere and Eleemosynis, containing an
effectual exhortation to the works of charity from the reward that God has
promised, and will graciously bestow on those that are forward in these works.
Nusquam Dominus meritis ad premium deerit, God will no where be wanting to our
good works, to reward them. To them that overcome in peace, he will give a
white crown for their actions, and to them that overcome in persecution, he
will redouble a purple crown for their suffering. Where he says no more,
being rightly understood, than the Preachers of the Gospel use to say upon the
like occasion.

His allegation ou^ of H^larie, Regnum Dei vitae nostrae stipendiis quaramus
Hilarie. In Mat. can. ^.
is a gross m^aking of stipends for merits, which are contraries. For merits
in his ow^e conceit are men's works; stipends are the rewards, which God g^veth
to our works. And this absurdity is increased by our ^al. 682. s.
Ie^uites translation set forth in capital Letters. Let us, says he, endeavor
to pu^chase the Kingdom of heaven by the price of our good life, so that in his
learning quaerere, is to endeavor to purchase, and stipen^ia vitae nostrae is
the price or merit of our good life. The words are spoken by way of exposition
upon Matthew. 6. 33. Where our Savior having dissuaded us from seeking
inordinately the things of this life, directs us what we are first to seek.
Mat. 6. 33.
But first seek the Kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these
things shall be added unto you, all these things, that is, stipendia vitae
nostrae, the stipends of this life of ours which God has promised to give to
them that seek his Kingdom and his righteousness, as the petty rewards of our
piety. For those things that he calls stipends, must either be stipends by
us given to God, or by us received from him. But the former is absurd, if not
blasphemous, therefore by the stipends of this life we are to understand (...)
the things of this life, as food and apparel, etc, which God (...) as it were
by way of advantage or surplusage, adds to these to whom he gives his
kingdom and righteousness, which they first sought: for so he says (...).
But if the kingdom of God which with these things 1 Cor. 10. 31.
is to be sought, were, by them to be purchased, then the righteousness of
God by which we are justified and entitu^ed to that kingdom, that is the
righteousness of God 2 Pet. 1. 1.
and our Savior Jesus Christ, should also be purchased by Gods temporal
gifts, for so he says, seek the kingdom of God, and his righteousness, and
therefore it rather than they should be called stipendium or merces; which the
Papists themselves deny, it being gratia only, a^ they confess, and not
m^rces.

As for those other words, I^ Mal. can. 6.
which Bellarmine cites, De nostro igitur est beata illa aeternitas
promerenda, etc. I presume, that he himself would not subscribe unto them, as
they sound, as if we attained to heaven by any thing that is properly ours,
and from our selves. But Hi^ari's meaning may be gathered from that which went
before. For writing upon Matthew. 7. 22. Many shall say to me in that day, Lord,
Lord, have not we prophesied in thy Name, and in thy Name cast out Devils, etc.
says, that Christ condemns the hypocrisy of counterfeit Preachers who,
though they were vo^d of sanctifying grace, yet because they prophesied and
wrought wonders in his Name, did therefore promise to themselves the kingdom
of heaven: quasi vero eorum aliquid proprium sit quae loq^ntur aut faciun^, as
if any of those things, which they say or do were their own, they being but
the instruments of God by whom he speaks and works, for the good of
others: and therefore both the word and the work is not thei^s, but Gods. But
if we desire to attain to that blessed eternity; pr^standum aliquid est ex
proprio, at bonum velimus malum omne vitemus, totoque affectu praeceptis
caelesti^us obtemperemus, we must do something of our own, that we will
that which is good, and shun all evil, and with all our affection obey the
heavenly precepts, which though they be not from our selves, yet may be called
ours, as being our works, and properly tending to our own good.

To the testimony of Ambrose, Nonne evidens est meritorum aut praemia Ambrose
De ^ffic. l. 1. c. 15.
^t s^pplicia post mortem manner? we readily subscribe, understanding by
merits, according to the language of the Latin Fathers, works with relation
to reward, whether good, or bad.

To the testimony of Jerome, Denarius quas^ indalgentia very principis Hierome.
Advers. ^ovinian. lib 2.
^mnes per baptismum omittit de car^ere. I am nostri laboris est, pro
d^versitate virtutum, diversa nobis praemi^ praeparare: I answer, that he
di^puting against Iovin^an, who held equality of rewards in the life to come,
using for his argument one and the same day-peny which was given to unequal
labors, answers, that unus denarius no^ est unum pr^mium, one penny is not
one and the same reward, sed un^ vita, ac una de gehenna libe ratio, but one
life and one deliverance out of hell. But as at the granting of a Princes
pardon men that are guilty of diverse crimes are all released out of prison, and
every one according to his labor or his works, is in this or that state of
life: Even so the penny, as it were the pardon of the true Prince by baptism
releaseth all out of prison. Now it must be our l^bour, according to the
diversity of virtues, to prepare unto our selves diverse rewards. His meaning is
that in the life to come, which as it is eternal, is one and the same to all,
there are diverse degrees of glory. Whereas therefore we have deliverance from
hell and title to heaven by the true Princes pardon, it being purchased for all
true believers by the merit of Christ, which in Baptism is equally applied to
all the faithful: it must therefore be our endeavor, by laboring for a
greater measure of grace, to prepare, as it were, for our selves a greater
measure of glory. For the Lord does crown his own graces in us with glory, and
the greater graces with greater glory. And although both the life it self and
the degrees of glory therein, as to sit, some on Christ's right hand, and some on
his left in his kingdom, are prepared by God, as it is said, Matthew. 20. 23.
and by our Savior, who therefore ascended into his fathers house, wherein are
many mansions, that he might prepare or provide a place for each of us, Ioh.
14. 2, 3. yet we may be said, after a sort to prepare for our selves greater
rewards when we labor to be endued with greater graces. Paulinus ad
Victricium.


To the testimony of Paulinus; Tuarum tibi praemia se debere virt^tum justus
j^dex agnoscet, I only answer this, because I have not the book: that
although it be a harsh speech, that God should be said to be a debtour to
any cr^ature; yet as Augustine says, he may be said to be a debtour, as he
is a promiser, and because it is a just thing to keep promise, he may be said
to owe the performance of that which he has promised. Uid. supr. cap. 4.. 15.
But as his promise was, not de debito, but de gratuit^: so what he freely
promised, he freely gives.

7. Out of Augustine he cites three testimonies, two out of his Epistle
Augustine Epist. 105.
to Sixtus: out of which Epistle I have before produced diverse pregnant
testimonies against merits so properlycalled. His first allegation is this:
nullane sunt merita justor^m? sunt plane: quia ^usti sunt: sed ut justi fierent
merita non fuerunt. In which testimony there is nothing for the merit of
condignity, but only the name of merit, which notwithstanding ^ignifieth
nothing but the good works of the just; which God will reward. As if he had
said, have the just no good works, which God will reward? They have, no doubt,
because they are just. For, as Saint John says, he that works righteousness
is righteous 1 I^h. 3. 7. But as the former words do not prove the merit of
condignity: so the later words plainly disprove merits of congruity, that they
might become righteous says he, they had no merits: for as in the same
Epistle Augustine teaches against bothsorts of merits. Sicut ab initio fidei
misericordiam consequuti sumus, non quia fideles eramus, sed ut essemus; sic in
fine quod e^it in vita aeterna, coronabit nos, sicut scriptum est in
miseratione and miseric^rdia.

Secondly, as touching the other Sicut merito peccatitanquam stipendium
readitur mors: ita merito justitiae, tanquam stipendium vitu aeterna, which is
repugnant to that of the Apostle Romans 6. 23. if it be not understood of a free
stipend as indeed Augustine does understand it.
Augustine indeed says, that as the Apostle calls death the stipend of
sin, so he might truly have called eternal life the stipend of
righteousness. But yet he could not say that it was debitum stipendium.
Because the Apostle by way of opposition says; that death is the stipend,
meaning the due and deserved stipend of sin, but eternal life is the free
gift of God. Nay he says the contrary, Ibid page 302.
that it is not to be demanded tanquam debitum stipendium. And De gratia and
lib. arb. c. 9.
elsewhere, as we heard before; though the Apostle might have said, that
eternal life is the stipend of righteousness; yet he would rather say, that
it is the grace of God; that hereby we might understand, that God does not
bring us to eternal life by our merits, but by his mercy. And in the same
hundred and fifth Ad Sixtum.
Epistle. The stipend of sin is death: and worthily it is called a stipend,
because it is due, etc. Deinde ne justitia de humano se extolleret bono, sicut
humanum meritum malum non dubitatur esse peccatum, non a contrario retulit
dicens, stipendium justiti^ vita aeterna, sed gratia (inquit) Dei vita aeterna
-- tanquam diceret; audito, quod stipendium peccati est mors, quid te disponis
extollere, and contrariam m^rti vitam aeternam tanquam debitum stipendium
flagitare? But of this point I have spoken more than sufficiently when I urged
Supr. cap* 2.. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17.
our fourth testimony out of Romans 6. 23.

But the third testimony De merib. Ecclesia. cap. 25.
Bellarmine chiefly urges, Vita aeterna est t^tum praemium, cujus promissione
gaudemus. Eternal life is the whole reward in the promise whereof we do
rejoice: nor can this reward come before merits be had, neither may it be given
to a man before he be worthy. For what more unjust than this, and what more
just than God? We must not therefore demand the reward, before we merit to
receive it.

Answ. Augustine, as himself Retractat. l. 1. c. 7. Minus memorem
scripturarum, in quibus non dum assuetus, eram.
testifies, wrote this book when he was newly baptized, and as yet not
accustomed or well versed in the Scriptures, and therefore if he should have
written any thing therein contrary to that, which I have heretofore proved out
of him, it ought not to prejudge those manifold pregnant Testimonies by me
cited before, which he wrought when he was of more mature judgment and of
riper years. Notwithstanding out of this testimony such as it is, Bellarmin^
collecteth five conclusions against us. First, that a man (he means ^o doubt
a righteous man) has the merits of eternal life; that is, as Bellarmine
acknowledges Augustine to use the term, that he has good works which God
will reward with eternal life: and that we confess.

Secondly, that eternal life is one and all our reward. But Augustine does not
say un^m, neither is it true. For temporal Blessings are also rewards Deuteronomy.
28. 1. ad 15. 1 Timothy 4 10.
, though but petty rewards in comparison of eternal life: neither does he say
simply totum, but t^tum cujus promissione gaudemus. For, temporal benefits we
are to use, but not to set our hearts upon them: but spiritual blessings are
those wherein Lu^. 10 20.
we are to rejoice: them we use; these, we are to enjoy: for those are utenda,
but these are sruenda.

Thirdly, that the reward of eternal life is given in justice, that we should
not say, that it is given of mere liberality. But Augustine every where else
teaches, that it is given of grace, and that it is called grace, non ob aliud,
nisi quia gratis datur, for no other cause but because it is fre^ly given, and
that it is not grace, si non sit omni modo gratuita. Neither does it hinder it
to be of Gods free grace, that it is given in justice. For these two in the
works of God, especially in the work of justification and salvation do meet
together. Grace and mercy in respect of us, in that he does justify and save
us gratis by f Romans 3. 24.
his grace: justice, not in respect of our merits, which in justice can merit
nothing at the hands of God but punishment: but partly in re^pect of Christ's
merits, unto which eternal life is due; and partly in respect of his promise
made in Christ to all that truly believe; which promise he is faithful and
just to perform.

Fourthly, that the reward is not given before they be found worthy of it that
shall have it, lest we should fay, there is no dignity in works. I answer,
that our dignity stands in Gods dignation or acceptance in Christ: which
dignity he vouchsafes to all that truly believe in Christ. For to them Christ
Rom 10. 4.
is the end and complement of the Law: insomuch, that whosoever believe in
Christ, they are esteemed to have fulfilled the Law: We acknowledge the
dignity of good works, as being the fruits of the Spirit, and as being good,
profitable, and necessary: but no dignity of merit do we ascribe to them. And
yet the faithful are not therefore unworthy, nor destitute of merits, so long
as they are accepted in Christ, and made partakers of his merits by faith: Unto
which faith Augustine uses to ascribe merit. For indeed faith is that work
of. Ioh. 6. 29.
God, which he requires instead of all our merits, because by it we are
partakers of the merits of Christ: which whosoever has is not without merits,
nor unworthy of the Kingdom of Heaven.

Fifthly, that it is a most unjust thing to desire eternal life of God the
most just judge, before we merit to receive it. Where, faith he, he plainly
condemns all Lutherans, who will not by their works merit eternal life, and
yet by assurance of faith they presume it shall be given them. Answ. If by his
word, petere, he mean desiring by prayer, I say we must desire it, before we
be worthy of it in our selves. But Augustine has the word poscere, meaning,
that no man ought to challeng or demand eternal life as his due, before he has
deserved to receive it: To which I answer, that none can deserve to receive it
by their ow^e merits, and that none but Pharisees will challenge it. But yet
all that truly believe in Christ do in him deserve it, yea in him they have
it: and he that will not believe this, he makes God a liar, 1 Ioh. 5. 10, 11.
and therefore every one that knows himself to believe, does or ought to
know, that he has eternal life, 1 John 5. 13. He might have added a sixth
collection, that nothing is more unjust, than that God should give rewards to
men before they deserve them. But this shows the unsoundnesse of this
Testimony, not beseeming Augustine. For what God gives, he freely gives; and
in that which is grat^itum free, there is no unjustice. May not God do with
his own Matthew. 5. 15.
what pleafeth him: and therefore no unjustice, when he gave the whole days
wages to them that had wrought but an hour, and therefore to such as had not
deserved it. And if it be unjust with God to give the reward of eternal life
to them that have not in their own persons deserved it, what will he say of
Gods dealing with the elect infants, who dying in their infancy are crowned
with eternal life. This Testimony therefore was but the assertion of an
ungrounded Divine. And yet this Testimony alone with our Mal. 686.
Braggadochio is sufficient to put us all to silence.

Eighthly, His allegation of Prosper, justificatus homo, id est, ex impio
Prosper Resp. ad c. 6. Gallo. rum.
pius factus, nullo praecedente bono merito accipit donum, quo medio acquir at
and meritum, makes wholly against the merit of congruity, which with the
Pelagians the Papists do hold: but against us it has nothing, except perhaps
the word, merit, which is not against us in that sense, that he and Augustine
use it, for a rewardable work, which before justification men have not, but
with their justification they receive grace, from which what good works do
proceed, are to be rewarded with eternal life.

Ninthly, the word merit being understood in that sense, as undoubtedly
Caele^inus epist. ad Gallos. c. 12.
it is in all the Latin Fathers, we subscribe to the Testimony of Caelestinus
Bishop of Rome, as making for us, rather than against us. For having said, Dei
gratia omnia hominis merita praeveniri, that all the good works of men are
prevented by Gods grace: he adds, Tant a est enim erga omnes homines bonitas
Dei, ut nostra velit esse merita, quae sunt ipsius Dono, and pro his quae
largitus est, aeterna premia sit donaturus, which notably sets forth the
unspeakable goodness of God to us, but not our desert toward him.

Tenthly, the like is to be said of his allegation out of Gregory, on Gregory
Moral. lib. 4. c. 42.
those words of Job c. 3. 19. ( Parvus and magnus ibi sunt) quia in hac vita
nobis est discretio operum, ^rit in illa proculdubio discretio dignitatum: ut
quo hic alius alium merito superat, illic a^ius alium retributione transcen^at:
where he using promiscuously the words opera and merita, by merita
understands opera bona proceeding from grace, which he acknowledged to be
the free gifts of God. Wherefore his meaning is no more but this; that on those
to whom in this life God does give greater grace, he bestows in the life to
come greater glory.

Eleventhly, in the last place he alleges Bernard, who in the Bernard in
Cantic. sermon. 68.
whole controversy of justification, and in this question of merits, is wholly
ours. Out of him he cites two Testimonies. The former, Merita habere cures,
habita data noveris: perniciosa paupertas, pen^ria meritorum. Answ. Bernard
uses ordinarily the word merit unproperly, according to the use of the Latin
Fathers, meaning thereby good works, and that either simply, or with relation
to reward, that is to say, rewardable works: such works or merits, says
Bernard, we must be careful to have; and having them, we must acknowledge them
to be Gods gifts: the penur^ of them is Mat. 25. 41, 42.
pernicious poverty. The other, Sermon. 81.
Omne quod feceris bonum malumve, quod quidem non facere liberum sit, merito ad
meritum deputatur. Answ. That is worthily accounted merit, that is a rewardable
work, which is free for a man not to do. For what is not voluntary but
forced, it deserves not reward. But to speak of merits properly, as justly
and condignely deserving a due and proportionable reward for the works sake,
Bernard acknowledges no merits, but the mercies of God and the merits of
Christ: denying our works to be our merits but Gods gifts, nor to be merits
properly, or meritorious causes of our salvation, as I have showed Supr. c. 4..
6, 7
before.

And these were all the testimonies of the Fathers, which Bellarmine thought
good to produce: which when the Reader has compared with those which I
formerly alleged, let him pronounce secundum allegata and probata, whether
we, or the Papists, have the consent of Antiquity in this great question of
merits.

IV. But to the testimonies of the Fathers Bellarmine adjoyneth the authority
of four Councels. The first whereof is the second Council held at Aurenge
Council. Aransuan. 2c. 18.
in France. Debetur merces bonis operibus, si fiant, sed gratia qui non
debetur, praecedit ^t fiant. Reward is due to good works when they be
wrought, but grace, which is not due, goes before, that they may be wrought,
which Canon as all the rest is collected out of the writings of Augustine, for
the confutation of the Semi-pelagians, and is to be understood according to
the constant and perpetual doctrine of De verbis Apostoli, sermon. 16. De Verbis
Dom. sermon. 31.
Augustine, that reward is due to good works (not in respect of the dignity or
worth of works, but) in regard of Gods Promise. Now there is great difference
between that In Psalm. 32. 83. 109.
which is due by desert, and that which is due by promise. For where a great
reward is promised to a small work, the reward is due by promise, but not by
desert. But much more when eternal life is promised to our works, betwixt
which there is no proportion. Therefore though eternal life be a reward due
in regard of promise, yet it is a free and undeserved reward, and is therefore
called (...) the free gift of God, or as Augustine uses to render it according
to the vulgar Latin, gratia, and that in opposition to the wages or deserved
reward of sin, Romans 6. 23. and is so called gratia, non ^b aliud, nisi quia
gratis datur, as I have showed before.

As for the other three Popish Councels, viz. Lateranense, Florentinum,
Tridentinum, they are not to be accepted, as witnesses; but to be excepted
against, as parties.

V. We have heard Bellarmines testimonies, both of Scriptures, Bellarmines
reason. De justif. li. 5. c. 4.. (...) ultimo.
and Fathers; now we should hear his reason, but that we have heard, and
confuted it before. In the last place, says he, there may be added one
evident reason from those things which were prooved in the former book. For it
has been demonstrated, that the good works of the just are truly just, that
they satisfy the Law of God, that they justify a man, whereupon it follows
that they are truly meritorious. Whereunto I ret^rne this answer. First, to
the Antecedent: that it has been sufficiently demonstrated, that the work of
just or justified men, though they may be said to be truly good, yet they
are not pur^ly good, that they do not satisfy the Law of God, that they do
not justify a man before God: so far are they from being truly meritorious.
Secondly, to the consequence, that although they were truly good, although by
them men did satisfy the law of God by doing all that is commanded: yet so
long as men do but their duty, they must confess themselves to be but
unprofitable servants, neither do they merit any thing at the hands of God.
For Debitum non est meritum, that which is debt is not merit. And if they
could, (which they cannot,) by their obedience satisfy the commandment for
the time to come; yet how shall they satisfy the penalty for their sins
past? wherefore a servant is well apaied, as Theophylact said, if he escape the
whippe, though he cannot deserve so much as thanks, which is but a verbal
reward. But he prooveth the consequence, because the chief reason why we
(poor heretics) deny merits, is because we think that no work in this life
is truly just; or does satisfy the law, but that all our works are mortal
sins in their own nature, etc. Answ. Though we were heretics (which he
with all his accomplices shall never be able to prove) yet would it not become
him to belie us. For neither do we deny the good works of the faithful to
be truly just, neither do we say, that they are sins and much less
mortal sins, neither is that the chief reason why we deny them to be
meritorious, as you may perceive by the reasons before alleged, neither if
that reason do (as it does) prove them not to be meritorious, does it follow,
that therefore the contrary does prove them to be meritorious at the hands of
God. For though they were not only truly, but also purely good, though they
were not sinful nor stained with the flesh, as all are; yet so long as they
are our duties, so long as they are Gods free gifts, so long as there is no
proportion between them and the reward, so long as they are accompanied with
manifold sins and infirmities, and so long as all the reasons before alleged
against merits stand in force: it follows necessarily, that we neither do or
can by all the works we can perform, merit any good thing, and much less
the eternal reward at the hands of God.

CHAP. VII. Other Questions concerning merits discussed: as of trust in merits,
and of an eye to the reward.
. I.

ANd yet here is not an end: For still ac ording to his Method, such as it is,
he has certain qu^stions to discuss. In mine opinion, he being to dispute
of merits, if he had meant to deal plainly and sincerely, should first have
showed what merit is, and what is required to a meritorious work. Secondly,
what sorts of merits there are, and what thereby is merited. Thirdly, whether
the good works of the faithful be meritorious or not, and if they be, how
far forth, and then in the last place the two questions might have been
propounded, ^s (...), that seeing, as he teaches, good works do merit
reward; whether it be lawful to do a good work, having an eye to the
reward. Secondly, whether men may trust in their merits. But he first disputes
against us, that the good works of the faithful be truly meritorious of
eternal life, which hitherto he has endeavored to Lib. 5.
prove in his first sixth chapters. In the second place, he disputes the t^o
accessory questions: the one, whether and how far forth men may trust in
their merits, cap. 7. the other, whether it be lawful in doing good works to
have an eye to the eternal reward, cap. 8, 9. Then he comes to show against
some learned men of their own side, among whom there is great dissension in
this question of merit. First, what is required to make a work meritorious,
and shows that to a merit, seven conditions are required, cap. 10, 11, 12,
13, 14, 15. Secondly, how far forth good works are either meritorious or
rewarded. Meritorious, whether ex condign^, cap. 16. and if so, whether in
respect of the promise only, or also in regard of the work it self, cap. 17,
18. And as touching the reward, whether GOD does reward good works supra
condignum, cap. 19. In the last place, what those things are that are merited
ex condigno, viz. eternal life. c. 20. and the increase of justice, but not
the grace of justification, cap. 21. nor reparation after a fall, nor
perseverance to the end, which three are merited ex congruo, as he says, cap.
22.

II. His discourse De j^stif. l. 5. c. 7.
concerning trust and affiance, whether it be to be reposed in merits, and how
far forth, serves to no other purpose, but to answer one of our arguments;
and therefore I handled this question, so far as was needful, in our
eleventh argument. Neither shall it now be needful to insist thereupon;
first, because having, as I hope, sufficiently prooved, that we have no
merits, it is needless to prove, that we are not to trust in them. Secondly,
because Bellarmine confesses, that by reason of the uncertainety of o^r own
righteousness, and danger of vainglory (for how can a man trust in his own
merits, when he knows not whether he has any or not, which is the condition
of Nemo absque revela^one certo scire po^est, se habere vera merita, a^ in eis
in fine^ usque perseve^aturum.
all Papists: or how is it possible, that a man who is guilty to himself of
sin, should without pharisaicall pride, trust to be saved in his own
merits: and therefore to say, it is lawful to trust in our merits modo
superbi^ caveatur, is as if I should say, it is lawful to worship idols with
divine worship, modo id^lolatria caveatur) it is Propter incertitud^em (...)
and periculuminanis gloriae, tutissimum est fiduciam totam in sola Dei
misericordia and benignitate reponere.
most safe to repose our whole affiance in the mercy and bounty of God;
whereunto he might have added, the merits of Christ, by trusting in which we
are taught also to rerepose affiance, not only in the Mercy, but also in the
justice of God. And if our whole affiance be to be reposed in Gods goodness,
then no part thereof is to be placed in our own merits: or if our affiance
be to be reposed in our merits at all, then it is not most safe to place our
whole affiance in Gods mercy. And if it be most safe to repose our whole
affiance in the goodness of God, then are they unwise who place it in their
own goodness. But besides the danger of pride, which cannot be avoided, and
of being perniciously deceived, if we trust to our own merits as to a broken
staff, we should also commit horrible impiety in making idols of our own
merits, or rather of our selves. For in what we repose our trust for
salvation, that we make our God. So should we s^bject our selves to the curse
of God, who says, Ier. 17. 5.
Cursed be the man, that trusts in man, and makes flesh his arm, and whose
heart departs from the LORD.

. III. His other discourse de intuitu mercedis in the overt intention Of an eye
to reward. De iustif l. 5. c. 8. which is to be had not only nor chiefly.
or pretense, which he expresses, is a mere calumniation: in the covert
intent, which he dares not pretend, it is a mere aberration from the truth.
The overt intention is to calumniate Calvin and all true Catholics, as if we
held it unlawful, when we do any good works to have in the doing of them an
eye to the eternal reward; when it is evident by the very places, which he
alleges out of Iustif lib. 32 cap. 16 3. and cap. 18.. 2. Anti^ot. council.
Trid. sess. 6. can. 31.
Calvin, that he taught nothing in this point, but that which Bellarmine
affirms to be the doctrine of the Council of Trent, and which himself
acknowledges to be true; to wit that it is lawful in doing good to have an
eye to the reward; but that this ought not be our chief respect. For our
chief respect ought to be the glory of God, which we must seek by a godly
life to advance, though there were neither heaven nor hell: but the desire of
the eternal reward is but a secondary respect, which is subordinate to Gods
glory, and to be desired for it. Bellarmine says De iustif. l. 5. c. 9. ad
pri^um.
well Cupimus Deum videre, atque ex ea visione felices effici, ut tanto
ardentius and securius Deum diligamus. The glory of God we are to seek, though
our profit were not subordinated unto it, and therefore though we were not to
have an eye to the reward. Non sine praemio diligitur Deus, q says Bernard,
Etsi absque praemii intuitu diligendus sit. For those that do good, g Bernard.
de diligendo Deo.
only, or chiefly for the ^eward, are led like hirelings by a mercenary
respect, without which they would not serve him, which becomes not the sons
of God neither does their obedience or service proceed from the love of God or
their neighbors, but from self-love; neither is eternal life to be expected
as the stipend of servants, but as the inheritance of sons. (...), says
Deiis qui putant se ex operi iustificari, sent. 54.
Marc^s Eremita, he that does good and seeks remuneration only or chiefly,
he serves not God, but his own will; neither does he love or serve God propter
ipsum, sed propter se, not for Gods sake, but for his own.

. IV. But that in a secondary respect, after the glory of God, we But in a
secondary respect.
may and ought to have an eye to the eternal reward, it is confessed, or
rather prosessed by us. And it is evidently proved, first, by Gods promises o^
rewards and blessings, and by his threatenings and curses, which God does
therefore propound, as by threatenings to deter from evil for fear of the
punishment; so by promises to allure us to the doing of good in expectation of
the reward.

Secondly, by plain direction of Scripture, as Tit. 2. 12, 13. the saving
grace of God does teach us to perform the duties of sanctification in
expectation of the happiness hoped for. So Luke 16. 9. Make you friends of the
Mammon of iniquity, that when you fail, they may receive you into everlasting
habitations. Col. 3. 23, 24. servants are to do, that which they do to their
Masters, heartily, as to the Lord, knowing that of the Lord they shall receive
the reward of the inheritance.

Thirdly, By the examples of the godly in the Scriptures, as first of Moses,
who by faith refused to be called the son of Pharaohs daughter etc. because
he had an eye (...), to the recompense of reward, Heb. 11. 26. Of David, Psalm.
119. 112. I have inclined my heart to do thy statutes, for ever is the reward,
or as the Septuagints and the vulgar Latin read, because of the reward. Of
Paul, Phil. 3. 11, 12, 13, 14. Of the example of all examples our Savior
Christ, whom we are to imitate: who for the joy, that was set before him,
endured the cross, and despised shame, etc. Heb. 12. 2.

Fourthly, In doing good works, which is the way wherein we are to walk we
have an eye to the end of our journey, which is the end of our faith, 1 Pet. 1.
9. and of our sanctification, Romans 6. 22. that is, the salvation of our souls.
They who are in a journey (as we all are viatores) travel, that they may come
to their journeyes end, and they who are in a race, do run, that they may
obtain, 1 Cor. 9. 24.

Fifthly, Because as the glory of God is the sovereign universal end; so
eternal salvation is the (...) the supreme particular end of man, subordinate
to the universal end. And therefore as in all our actions we are to have
respect to the glory of God, 1 Cor. 10. 31. so we may have respect to our
salvation, as subordinate unto it. And who knows not, but that the final
cause, though it be last in execution, yet is the first in the intention.

. V. The thing which Bellarmine covertly intends, is, that it is lawful to
do good works with an intention to merit eternal life thereby, to which end
if his discourse de intuitu mercedis be not referred, it is impertinent: and
yet not any one of his testimonies or proofs does conclude so much we are to
perform good works, indeed that we may obtain and may gather assurance that
we shall obtain the gracious reward, which God has freely promised, and will
freely bestow upon all those that lead a godly life: but not that we should
merit any reward of God, as due in justice for the works sake. And this is one
of the Papists chief quarrels against us, that we forsooth discourage the
people from good works, in that we teach they do not merit; nor are to be
done to that end, when notwithstanding we use betterarguments than they do,
to encourage men to well doing. But we reply, that the Papists, by telling the
people, that they are to do good works, that thereby they may merit eternal
life, do teach them to mar their works, and instead of performing works
meritorious, or well pleasing to God, to do that which is odious and
abominable in his sight, as being derogatory from the all-sufficient merit of
Christ. For if Christ has fully purchased by his merit the kingdom of heaven
for us, then our merits need not: or if they need, then Christ his merit is not
sufficient for us. We are therefore in the performance of good works to have
an ^ye to the eternal reward, they being the way wherein we are to walk
toward it, and the means whereby we may gather assurance to our selves that
we shall obtain it. But we are no^ to do good works to that end, that by
them we may merit eternal life, which is purchased by the alone merit of
Christ.

CAP. VIII. Questions which Bellarmine disputes against other Papists
concerning merits. And first concerning the conditions of Merit.
. I.

HItherto Bellarmine has opposed the true Catholics, whom he calls
heretics. Now, because merit, as the Papists conceive of it, is a fiction
which has no ground, either in the Canonical Scriptures, or in the writings
of the ancient Fathers; it is not to be marvelled, if in this question, which
is de non Ente, they be miserably divided among themselves. Bellarmine therefore
in the Chapt^rs following maintains that doctrine which he has delivered
against us as the received doctrine of their Church, against the private
opinions of some learned men among themselves; who in some particulars, either
agree with us, or at least disagree from the common tenes of the Papists. And
first against Holkot, and a Doctor of Lovaine (whose private opinions were
censured and condemned by Pius the fifth) and Guilielmus Al^isiodorensis
concerning the conditions required to a meritorious work. Which, as Bellarmine
says De iustif. l. 5. cap. 10.
, are seven.

The first condition is that the work be good. For if it be bad, it The three

meriteth nothing but punishment. I suppose he means materially good as
being a thing commanded, or good ex genere suo in respect of his kind, as
prayer, alms, etc. For to a work formally good, he requires all the
conditions following.

Secondly, that it be done in obedience to God, and out of a desire Secondly,

to please him: (for so much the phrase in obsequium Dei seems to import,)
otherwise we cannot expect a reward from him. This, as it is evident in the
duties which immediately we perform unto God; so it is true in those which we
perform immediately to man, and mediately to God, whom we are to serve not
only in holiness, but in righteousness also.

world; who are called viatores: to whom alone as the commande^nts are
directed, so the promises are made. For of those who are in heaven the question
cannot be understood, seeing they are comprehensores who have already obtained
the reward. These three are, as he says, agreed upon; the other four are
questioned.

. II. The fourth condition therefore is that it be liberum, free, disputed
against Robert Holkot. This is indeed a proper condition, if Four conditions
controverted.

17. 10. But by liberum, Bellarmine understands that which is The fourth is,

willingly performed, meaning no more but that to merit is required free will:
without which condition the work indeed cannot be so much as morally good
(for such proceed (...) from election) and muchlesse meritorious. But though
without this condition a work cannot merit, yet neither it nor all the rest
which he names, are sufficient to make a work truly meritorious of eternal
life. Howbeit, Bellarmine should have done well to express himself, whether
he speak of liberum a coactione, or ab obligatione, or necessitate officii;
and if the former, whether he speak of arbitrium liberum, or liberatum,
whether free by nature, or freed by grace. For if the good work proceed from
Gods grace, it cannot merit at Gods hand, as I have showed before. And it is
the opinion of some Papists, as it was of the Pelagians, that the virtue of
meriting, which they conceive to be in their works, proceeds from the power
of their own free will, as I have showed before. Neither needed Bellarmine to
have heaped up Testimonies of Scriptures and Fathers to prove that free will is
required to good works, unless he dispute of free will by nature. For that
all good works do proceed from the will free by grace, and are voluntarily
performed by the faithful, there is no doubt to be made.

. III. The fifth condition, that he, who must be thought to merit, The fifth
is, of a man in state of grace.
be in the state of grace, and the child of God by regeneration and adoption
which he proves against the aforesaid Doctor of Lovaine. This condition is
also necessarily required to every good work, not only meritorious of heaven
(for how should he attain to the inheritance of heaven, who is not the son
and heir of God) but also good and acceptable unto God. For without faith it
is impossible to please God, Heb. 11. 6. and without it, whatsoever is done is
sin, Romans 14. 23. And it is certain, that until the person be accepted, his
actions cannot be acceptable. Neither whiles the tre^ is bad, can the fruit be
good. Neither can a man do any thing that is good and acceptable to God, who
is not in Christ: as a branch Io^. 5. 5.
cannot be fruitful that is not in the vine. Neither is any man in Christ, but
he that is endued with a true faith, whereby he abides in Christ, and Christ
in him. And this we hold, both against the Papists, that no works of men not
regenerate, are good, and with the Papists against the Pelagians, that they are
not meritorious: which point good leave has he had at large to dispute Lib. 5.
c. 12, 13.
against the Pelagians, and so I proceed to the sixth.

. IV. The sixth condition proved De iustif. l. 5. c. 14.
against the said Doctor of Lovaine, that to the merit of eternal life is
required the free and The sixth is, no merit without Gods promise.
and gracious promise of God: which condition I acknowledge to be required unto
every rewardable work.

For first, seeing God is our absolute Lord, to whom we owe our selves and all
that we have, or can do, who may exact from us what he pleases without any
reward; we could not expect any remuneration from him, unless it had pleased
him for our encouragement unto well doing, to promise a reward unto us. But we
must remember, that his promise is not de debito, but de gratuito, not of
rendering a debt, but of giving a free reward: for he needed not to make a
promise for doing those things which he commands, which without a promise we
are bound to do: and therefore in that he promises a reward, it is of his
free grace; and when according to his promise he gives the reward, it is
wholly of his grace, and not of our merit.

Secondly, when there is no proportion of equality between the work and the
reward, but the reward incomparably exceeds the work; it is evident, that
such a reward promised to such a work, can no way be due to the work, as
merited thereby, but is wholly to be ascribed to the bounty of the Lord, who
freelygiveth what he had freely promised.

Thirdly, when a superaboundant reward is promised to a small work, and the
party to whom it is promised is no way able either to do, or so much as to
will the performance of it, but receives wholly his will and ability to
perform it from his Lord: the thing promised cannot be ascribed to his merit,
but to the gracious bounty of his Lord. Seventhly, that it proceed from charity.


. V. The seventh and last condition is that a meritorious work must proceed
from charity, which we acknowledge to be required in every good work. But in
the proof hereof he falls into a nice dispute, proving against Guihielmus
(...), that the virtue of meriting is to be ascribed more principally to
Charity than to faith. And although this be but an idle dispute, seeing
neither faith nor charity does truly and properly merit: yet I durst be bold
to affirm, that if to either merit were to be ascribed, that it were rather to
be attributed to faith. For by faith, the merits of Christ are applied unto
us, and not by charity. By faith, we are entitled to Gods Kingdom, by (...)
we are not. By faith, we obtain the inheritance, which by charity we do
not. By faith, we are saved and not by charity. Faith is the condition of the
covenant of grace, upon which, and no other grace, salva^ion is promised. Those
that truly love are also saved; it being the proper cognizance, and as Basi^
speaks, the character of the faithful, and none are saved without it: but
yet they are not saved by it, nor for it, but only by the merits of Christ,
which are apprehended by faith alone. Salvation which is purchased by the
merits of Christ is promised to faith, as that whereby we are made partakers of
Christ's merits; and are therefore said to be justified and saved by faith
alone: but charity and the fruits thereof are the evidence, according to which
God will save us. Christ is the foundation of our happiness, yea, he is
eternal life. Faith is the only instrument whereby we are made partakers of
Christ: all other graces are but notes and signs of our union which we have
with Christ, and of happiness by him. By faith we have this inheritance, but
it is had among those that are Act. 20. 32. and 26. 18.
sanctified. When it is said, happy is she L^kt. 45.
that believed, there the cause of happiness is noted: but when it is said
happy is he that loved, orfeared, not the cause of happiness is signified, but
a note or sign of it. Both faith and charity must concur to every good act:
for as a work without charity is not good; so without faith it is Romans 14. 23.
sin. But if you compare the graces together, it is certain that charity
proceeds from faith, 1 Timothy 1. 5. and according to the measure of our faith,
such is the measure of our love: for faith is the Mother-grace from which
charity and all other graces, as from the root and fountain do spring and
flow. It may seem indeed, that sanctification and inherent righteousness does
more principally consist in love, because charity is the fulfilling of the Law:
yet sanctification it self does flow from faith, which purifieth Act. 15. 9.
Gal. 5. 6.
the heart, and works by love. But as for the grace of justification,
whereunto merit (if we had any) ought to be referred (for justification is
the entitling of us to the kingdom of heaven) neither charity, nor any other
grace in us does concur unto it, but faith is all in all. I will not follow
him in his idle dispute: I confess the point, that to every rewardable or, as
he calls it, meritorious work charity is required.

. VI. Now let us recapitulate his seven conditions. And because Whether these
conditions concurring do make a work meritorious.
he shall not find me refractary, I do confess, that all and every of these
conditions are required to every rewardable work. For first, it must be good.
Secondly, it must be done in obeisance to God. Thirdly, it must be done by men
in this world. Fourthly, it must be voluntary and not forced. Fifthly, it must
be performed by a man who is in the state of grace. Sixthly, the expectation
of the reward is to be grounded on Gods promise. And lastly, it must proceed
from charity. But now say I, that not any one of these conditions, nor all of
them put together can make a work meritorious of eternal life before God.
They are common notes and marks of all good works whatsoever: but the proper
notes of merits are such, as I set down in the beginning of this discourse
concerning merits. For works are not therefore meritorious, because they are
materially good, nor because they are in obeisance to God, (for that is our
duty and debt which we owe to God) nor for that they are performed by such as
are viatores and pilgrims in this world, nor because they are wrought by men in
state of grace, nor because the expectation of the reward is grounded on Gods
promise, which is of a free reward and not of wages merited by us, nor lastly,
because they proceed from charity. For our charity, by reason of the
imperfection thereof, cannot stand in judgment to satisfy the justice of God,
and much less to merit. And whatsoever, or how great soever it is, it is not
only a duty which we owe to God, but the only debt which we owe, or ought to
owe to our brethren, and that for Gods sake, to omit that we receive it, as a
free gift from God, and therefore by it we cannot merit of him.

CHAP. IX. Bellarmines dispute that good works are meritorious ex condigno,
not only ratione pacti, but also ratione operis, examined.
. I.

IN the fourth place De justif. lib. 5. cap. 16.
Bellarmine discourfeth how far forth good works are either meritorious, or
are rewarded. Meritorious, whether ex condigno; and if so, whether ratione
pacti solum, or ratione operis also. That good works are meritorious ex
condigno, which is the matter that hitherto he has proved, he now
maintains against Durandus: affirming, that his Assertion, as it is refuted
by the common consent of all, almost Divines; so also by all the arguments
which formerly he has used against us, to prove that the works of the godly
are truly and properly meritorious, which I desire the Reader to take notice
of, because some draw-backs, who notwithstanding would seem stiff defenders
of merits, do bear the simple in hand, that it is but a Schoole-point to say
that works are meritorious either ex condigno, or ex congruo. When as in very
truth it is the received Doctrine of that Church, that the good works of the
godly are truly and properly meritorious of everlasting life. Now it is
evident that meritum ex congruo, is not truly and properly meritorious.

. II. In the next place, Bellarmi^e now taking it for granted that Whether
ratione pacti, or utriusque.
good works are meritorious ex condigno, he De justif. lib. 5. cap. 17.
disputes whether they be so ratione pacti tantum, or ratione operis tantum,
or ratione utriusque: whereunto I answer, that they are not ex condigno,
meritorious at all, as I have sufficiently proved before.

That they are condignely meritorious in respect of the work it self only,
and not in respect of the Promise or Covenant, was the opinion of Cardinal
Cajetan, and of Dominicus a Soto. That they are condignely meritorious not ex
ratione operis, but ex ra^ione pacti and acceptatiotis divinae, was the opinion
of Scotus, and some other Schoolmen, and of Andreas Vega. But both these
opinions Bellarmine rejects, and embraces the third, that good works are
condignely meritorious not only ratione pacti, but also ratione operis.
Howbeit, the former part of this Assertion seems to imply a contradiction.
For that which is due ratione pacti gratuiti, cannot also be due ratione
operis ipsius, unless there be an equal proportion between the work and
reward. If I promise to a Labourer in the vineyard for a days work an hundred
pounds, the sum is due in respect of the promise or covenant, but not
deserved by the Labourer. Such or rather greater is the disproportion between
our works and the heavenly reward.

Besides, that which is due ratione pacti grat^iti, is freely and undeservedly
bestowed: but the reward which is rendered to condign merit is justly deserved.

. III. And whereas Lib. 5. cap. 17. Sed quamquam.
Bellarmine propounds a distinction of eternal glory or happiness, saying,
that it may be considered either as it is an inheritance, or as it is a reward:
and says, as it is an inheritance it is due Eternal life considered as an
inheritance and as a reward.
to the persons of the faithful by right of adoption, but as it is a reward it
is due to their works by promise or covenant: first I answer, that this
distinction is unperfect, for eternal glory may be considered three ways,
either as a free gift given unto us in 2 Timothy 1. 9.
Christ before all secular times without respect of works, and prepared Matthew.
25. 34.
for us from the beginning of the world, or as the inheritance purchased by
Christ, or as a reward of our piety. Secondly, this distinction contradicts
three of his assertions: first, the maine assertion, which in this plac^ he
labors to prove, viz. that the good works of the godly do condignely merit
eternal life, even for the works sake. For as it is our inheritance or as it
is eternal life (which he calls the first degree of eternal glory)
himself confesses both here in the seventeenth Chapter, as also before in the
fourteenth, that it is not rendered to the merit of our works, but is due to
the persons of the faithful jure adoptionis, by the right of adoption, as they
are the sons and heirs of God; which right they have before they bring forth
good works, which (as he truly says) does manifestly appear in regenerated
infants, which dye in their infancy. And therefore it is evident by Bellarmines
own confession, both in this place, and also in the fourteenth Chapter, that
our heavenly inheritance (which is eternal life it self) is not merited by
our works, but is purchased by the merits of Christ's our Savior, and
therefore is one As it is a reward.
and the same to all that are saved. For as I have said heretofore, as the
merit of Christ is equally imputed to all that believe, so the reward of
Christ's merit in respect of the substance, as it is the eternal inheritance or
eternal life, shall equally be given to all that believe.

. IV. Again, as it is a reward, it is given ex pacto gratuito by a free
promise, and therefore not merited by our works, but according to the promise
freely given, and not ratione operis, as deserved thereby. Secondly, in
explication of this distinction Bellarmine says, De justif. lib. 5. cap. 17..
Sed quamquam. Ut haredit as, personae debetur jure adoptionis fine alio pacto:
ut bravium debetur operibu^ ex pacto. ^t pratereacum varii fint gradus
coeleftis gloriae, un^ tantum debet^r person^ jure adoptioni^, si^e alio pacto;
reliqui debentur operibus ex promissione vel pacto.
that whereas there are diverse degrees of heavenly glory or happiness; yet the
first only which is our heavenly inheritance it self, or life eternal is due
to the persons of the sons of God by right of adoption; the rest are due to
works by promise or covenant, which contradicts two other assertions. For
that which truly he says here and in the fourteenth Chapter, that the first
degree which is our heavenly inheritance, or eternal life it self or
salvation, is due to the persons of the faithful by right of adoption, and not
to their works; confuteth that assertion of his in his twentieth Chapter, that
eternal life even in respect of the first degree is rendered to the merit of
good works. And again, that which he truly says in his nineteenth Chapter
that God does reward good works supra condignum, above their desert and that
incomparabiliter and ineffabiliter, as he cites there out of Ad Monim. lib^.
cap. 10.
Fulgentius, confuteth that which here he labors to prove, good works do
condignely merit the rewards of heavenly happiness, meaning thereby the
degrees of eternal glory; and that not only ratione pacti, sed etiam ratione
operis.

It is true that there be diverse degrees of heavenly glory, wherewith God does
crown his children in mercy and loving kindness; neither is it to be
doubted, but that to those whom God has endued with greater measure of grace,
causing them to be more fruitful of good works; and making them more
excellent instruments of his glory and of the good of his chosen, he will give
them a greater measure of glory, crowning as I have said before, his greater
graces with greater glory. For as all that believe in Christ are equally
justified, but not all equally endued with grace: so all the faithful shall
be equally saved, but not all equally made partakers of glory. And as the
greater measure of grace is the free gift of 1 Cor. 4. ^.
God, and not our merit: so is the greater measure of glory, wherewith he
crowns his greater graces wholly to be ascribed to his grace and not to our
merit.

. V. Now let us briefly examine his seven arguments which Bellarmi^ seven
arg^ments.
he De justif. lib. 5. cap. 17.. primo.
brings to prove, that every good work of the righteous in respect of the
work it self is condignely meritorious of eternal life. Briefly, I say, for
they are not worthy to be stood upon, nor ye^ indeed to be mentioned, but only
to show the weakness of the Popish cause, which admits no better proofs:
which evidently appears by this, that our challenging Ie^uit Mal. (...).
when he takes upon him to prove the merit of condignity, contenteth himself
with the very same arguments for want of better.

His first Reason, Because life eternal is grace for grace, Ioh. 1. 16. that
is, the grace of reward for the grace of merits, or charity of our country for
the charity of the way. But between grace and grace sine dubio, without doubt
there is great likeness and proportion. No doubt but there is some likeness
between grace and glory, for grace is gloria inchoata, glory is gratia
consummata. But where is the equality on which condignity of merit should be
grounded, and which he propounded to prove, in the next Opera bona justoru^
esse (...) vi^ae (...) ex con digno non solum ra^one pacti and acceptationis
divinae, sede^iam rattone op^ris, ita ut in opere bono ex gratia praecedente
sit quaedam praportio and ^qualitas a ^ pr^mium (...) aterna. (...). de justis
lib. 5. c ^ 7.. Ja^ (...)
words going before? And if both the work be grace, and the reward be grace,
how can there be merit of condignity in the one to the other, that which is
given (...) is not given (...)* Romans 4. 4. for debitum non est gratuitum. If
eternal life be gratia, gratis data, si gratis datur, then is not due by
desert. And if the good work also be grace, how can it deserve a reward, and
so great a reward from him that gave it? For Bellarmine has taught us in the
beginning of this seventeenth Chapter, that if the work be much less than
the promised reward, it should not be a merit of condignity in respect of the
work. If, says he, the Master of the vineyard should promise to a labourer
for his days work, not the day-peny, but an hundred crowns, and yet the
heavenly reward given to a good work does incomparably surpass the unequal
proportion, that is, between an hundred crowns and a days work.

. VI. In his second argument he trifleth egregiously. He says, His second
reason.
there is a proportion between the fountain and the river running from it.
Grace is the fountain, Ioh. 4. 14. and eternal life is the river which makes
glad the City of God, Psalm. 46. 5. where according to the Latin it is thus
read, Fluminis impetus laetificat Civitate^ Dei, which Explan. in Psalm. 45.
Bellarmine himself expounds thus. Fluminis impetus laetificat Civi^taem
Dei, i. Non timebit populus Dei quando turbabitur terra, ergo, etc. Literally
the place is understood of the Brook Kidron and of the city of Jerusalem. But
if it must be allegorized, then as by the fountain grace is to be understood,
according to that of Ioh. 4. 14. so by the river should be understood
perseverance and increase of grace running to eternal life, as the sea,
wherein the course of all rivers ends. And therefore such as is the
proportion of the fountain to the sea, such is of grace or of a gracious work
to eternal life.

This was his first analogy; the second is no less ridiculous. Moreover, says
he, there is a proportion between the ascent and descent of water, for it does
ascend as high as it does descend; and therefore the grace of the Spirit which
descended from heaven will ascend as high. No doubt, if it be conveyed in a
close conduit pipe.

. VII. His third Reason, Eternal life is the day-peny of those that His third
reason.
labor in the vineyard, Matthew. 20. But the day-peny is the just hire of the
days labor. So is eternal life. The day-peny which was given to those that
wrought but one hour does signify eternal life, which is thereby proved not
to be an hire rendered as due to equal labor, but as a free reward bestowed
by the bounty of the Lord, who ^ may do with his own what he pleases. For if
it were the just wages for the whole days labor, then he that wrought but one
hour should have had but one twelfe part of the wages.

His fourth Reason, Seed in virtue physical is equal to that thing whereof it
is the seed, and contains it; Grace is the seed, and eternal life that
whereof it is the seed, therefore i^ virtue moral Grace is equal to glory.

Answ. This argument is grounded upon a similitude of grace, and seed, which
are not like in those things for which this comparison is brought. For neither
is seed the meritorious cause of that whereof it is the seed, as he supposes
grace to be, nor grace the seminall cause of eternal life: for seed is the
materiale principium. But grace, meaning grace inherent, is neither the
materiale principium, nor the meritorious cause, nor any other cause of
salvation, unles it be (...) sine qua non, which is no cause. Yea, but grace,
says he, is called the seed of GOD, 1 Ioh. 3. 9. Answ. The seed of God
properly is Gods word 01 Pet. 1. 23.
sown in our hearts as the seed of our new and spiri^uall life in this Luke
8. 11.
world. This seed conceived by the power of the Spirit is the grace of
regeneration, as the materiale principium of our spiritual life, meant in that
place of 1 Io^. ^9.
S. John, which always abides in the child of God, who being once borne of
God, is never unborne again. The fruits, in respect whereof it is called seed,
are the fruits of a godly life. For the seed of Gods Word being sown in our
hearts, and there conceived and taking root, fructifieth and brings Luke 8.
15.
forth increase, in some thirty, in some sixty, in some a^ hundred fold. The
grace of regeneration therefore is called seed in respect of the fruit of good
works, which it brings forth in this life. And further, the doing of good
works is compared to sowing of seed, which has relation to the great
harvest, as also the committing of the dead bodies of the faithful to the
earth. For even as he that casts his seed into the ground, does it in hope 1
Cor. 9. 10.
of increase at the next harvest, or as he that commits the dead body to
the earth 1 Cor. 15. 36. 42.
as seed, does it in hope of increase at the great harvest: so he which
sows in righteousness to the Gal. 6. 8.
Spirit, shall of the Spirit reap everlasting life. And as the seed cast into
the ground is not cast away, but is recompensed with increase at the harvest:
And as the body, though sown in corruption does not perish, but rises in 1
Cor. 15. 42.
incorruption at the great harvest: so he that sows the seed of good works,
though he may seem to cast them upon the waters, as Eccl. 11. 1.
Solomon speaks, he shall not lose thereby, but he shall be rewarded an
Mat. 19. 29.
hundredfold, and at the great harvest he shall inherit everlasting life. But
as the increase in harvest is not to be asscribed to the merit of the sower,
but to the blessing of God; and as the raising of the dead body to incorruption
1 Cor. 15. 38.
at the last day is not to be attributed to the merit of committing it, as
seed to the earth, but to the merit and power of CHRIST in whom 1 Cor. 15. 22.
we are made alive again: so the reaping of everlasting life at the great
harvest, is not to be asscribed to our merit, but to the merit of Christ, who
has purchased it for us, and to the undeserved mercy of God, who crowns his
own graces in us. So if we sow to our selves in righteousness, we shall
reap in mercy, as the H^s. 10. 12.
Prophet speaks.

IX. His fifth argument concludes nothing to the purpose. His fifth reason.
Eternal life, says he, is a certain supernatural action in respect of the
Object, and of the principles b^th efficient and formal: But merit, which
consists in love, is also a supernatural action in respect of the Object,
and of the principles both efficient and formal: therefore they have
aproportion between themselves, and the one leads to the other, as the right
way to the end. Answ. I grant that the grace of sanctification is the right way
to glorification, but no meritorious cause thereof. That there is a proportion
of likeness in the respects mentioned, but no proportion of equality. And that
which he speake^h of love, in which he takes for granted (which we deny)
that merit does consist, may be verified not only of the love of God, but of
faith, and hope, and the fear of God, and affiance in him, and other
sanctifying graces which have rel^tion unto God.

X. His six^h argument. It is God (in whom there is no want of power His sixth
reason.
or wise^ome to (...) what he w^eth) who decreed to bring the Elect to life
eternal, as the pr^ze, and as the crown of justice, by their meri^. Therefore
without doubt he gives them such merits, by which truly and properly and
even ex condigno, they may merit the crown. Answ. If God had decreed to bring
us to eternal life by our merits: no doubt but he would have provided for us
such merits of our own, as should truly and properly, that is, condignely
merit the same. But God has not provided such merits for us, as has been
before abundantly proved, neither has he purposed by our merits (which
indeed are none) to bring us to heaven, but only by the merits of Christ,
which alone do properly and condignely, yea, all-sufficiently and
super-aboundantly merit e^ernall life for us.

XI. His eventh argument: Our merits depend upon the merits of His seventh
reason.
Christ, both because he has merited for us the virtue or power of meriting,
and also because we merit as the lively members of Christ, and by influence
from him as our head, therefore they det^act from the glory of Christ, who say
that our ^erits are so unperfect, that they do not merit ex condigno, but in
respect of Gods acceptance. Answ. The power of meriting eternal life is
proper and peculiar to Christ our head, and not communicable to his members, as
I have h^retofore showed. Neither does it detract from his glory to say, that
our works are not meritorious: but on the contrary to give that to the members
which is proper to the head. Neither did he merit for good works that they
should be meritorious (which is an impudent fiction of these latter times.)
Neither was it his purpose to save us by making us our own saviors, but in
his own person Heb. 1. 3. (...)
to merit our salvation by his own Romans 5. 9. 19.
obedience, both active and passive, which being in themselves most sufficient,
our merits are needless.

And these were Bellarmines proofs against his own good Catholics. In the
next place he answers their allegations, which with many more I have urged
before Lib. 5. c. 18.
and maintained.

XII. After he has disputed how far forth good works are Of the reward of
good works.
meritorious, and has after his manner, proved them to merit ex condign^, and
that also ratione operis: now he questioneth Lib. 5. c. 19.
how far forth good works are rewarded. And he tells us, that it is the
common and received opinion of divines, that good works are rewarded by God
supra condignum, and evil works citra condig^um. To the former I subscribe:
and from thence disprove the merit of condignity. For if the heavenly reward
even in respect of the first degree does incomparably and unspeakeably exceed
the worth of our best works, as has been proved; then that it self, because
it is given supra condign^m, cannot be merited ex condigno. To the latter also
I subscribe, if it be understood of the sins of the faithful, in respect of
the faithful themselves. For the Lord does not deal with us after our sins,
nor reward us according to our iniquities, Psalm. 103. 10. But in all his
judgments he remembers ^ercie, Lam. 3. 33. Hab. 3. 2. and ever corrects us
under our deserts, Ezra. 9. 13. I say, in respect of themselves, for in respect
of Christ our surety, he exacted such a punishment, as did fully satisfy his
justice for our sins. And therefore he never punishes properly, that is, in
ordine justitiae, by way of vengeance to satisfy his justice, the sins of
the faithful, which he has punished in Christ: neither does he exact or
expect any satisfaction from them for their sins, for which our Savior
Christ has fully satisfied his justice. Notwithstanding, it cannot be denied,
but they are many times Psalm. 34. 19.
afflicted, and the judgments of God inflicted upon them: but yet when we are
judged, 1 Cor. 11. 32.
we are not punished by way of vengeance, but we are chastized of the Lord,
that we should not be condemned with the world. Now if God from our Savior
has exacted such a penalty, is satisfied for the sins of all the Elect; it
may be thought, that he will exact from the wicked a less punishment, than
will satisfy his justice. Some say, that God will not render to the wicked
secundum rigorem justitiae, quos just posset annihilare: but that also may be
questioned; seeing of those, who shall be condemned, our Savior says, that
it had been better for them that they had not been borne.

XIII. In the last place Bellarmine disputes of the things which Things
merited. Lib. 5. c. 20.
may be merited, or as he speaks, quae cadunt sub meritum de condigno: and
first he says, that the eternal life it self, the essential reward (which
he calls the first degree of heavenly glory, and which before he said was
due not to the merit of works, but to the persons of the faithful by right of
adoption,) it self, I say, and not only the degrees thereof (which are
incomparably and unspeakably supra condignum) may be condignely merited.
Secondly, the increase of justice is condignely merited by good works: we
deny not, but that by the practice of piety and exercise of good works men's
inherent righteousness is increased, according to that, Luke 19. 26. habenti
dabitur, to him that has (that is, does exercise his talents) it shall be
given, but that he shall ex condign^, by his works merit his second
justification, as they call it, and increase of justice, which is Gods Blessing
upon them, we have not learned out of the Scriptures; neither do we
acknowledge that we can by our best endeavors merit any good thing at the
hands of God.

XIV. And thus you see how in the last part of this controversy The Papists
high opinion of their works.
which is concerning works, the Papists have magnified, and as it were deified
their own works, alleging, not only that they are good, but purely and
perfectly good, such as not only do fully satisfy the law of God, but also
supererrogate, and therefore such as do not only justify us before God, but
also merit and deserve e^ernall life at his hands, and that truly and
properly, that is, condignely; and that not only ratione pacti, but also
ratione operis, that is, not only by Covenant, because God has promised such
a reward, but also for the dignity of the work, which is in proportion equal
to the reward: insomuch that it were unjustice in God, if he should not render
heaven to their works, which do as properly deserve heaven, as the works of
the wicked deserve hell; and that by their works they deserve not only
eternal life it self, which they ca^ the first degree of heavenly happiness,
but also the higher degrees of glory: and finally, which is a consequent of the
premises, that they may trust in their works, as being true causes of
salvation. All which assertions are insolent and Antichristian.

XV. But we, being in our selves most miserable sinners, say with Our
estimation of works.
Da^iel, Dan. 9. 7, 8, 9.
To thee, Lord, belongs mercy and Justice, but to us, shame and confusion of
face: and therefore we pray with David, Psalm. 14^. 2.
Enter not into judgment with thy servants, O Lord, for no man living can be
justified in thy sight, namely, if thou enter into judgment with him. For if
thou Lord Psalm. 130. 3.
mark iniquities, who shall stand? If we should argue with God, we should not
be able to answer one Job 9. 3.
of a thousand: with Esaias we confess, Esai. 64. 6.
that all our righteousnesses are as polluted clothes, as being stained with
the flesh, and therefore have cause to cry out with the Apostle, Romans 7. 24^
wretched men that we are who shall deliver us from this body of death. But
yet with the same Apostlc, Verse. 25.
we thank God through Jesus Christ our Lord; with David we profess that with
the Lord Psa. 130. 4, 7. 8.
there is mercy and forgiveness, that he may b^ feared, and with him there is
plentiful redemption, and he shall redeem the Israel of God from all their
iniquities. We believe that Christ by his death has satisfied for our sins,
and by his obedience has merited heaven for us; that he died for our sins,
Romans 4. 2.
and rose again for our justification, that we are justified by his Romans 5.
9. 19.
blood, and by his obedience we are constituted just: that he is the end and
complement of the Law for righteousness Romans 10. 4.
to all that believe in him; that of God he is made unto us 1 Cor. 1. 30, 31.
wisdom for our vocation, righteousness for our justification, holiness for
our sanctification, and redemption for our glorification: that according as it
is written, He that glories, let him glory in the Lord.

And howsoever we do teach, that those who are justified, are also sanctified;
and that no man can be assured of his justification without sanctification:
though we seriously urge, as our duty is, the necessity of good works, and
of a godly life, protesting with the Apostle, Heb. 12. 14.
that without holiness no man shall see God; though we teach that by our good
works we are to make our Election, our vocation, our justification sure unto
us: though we acknowledge, that they are the evidence by which we shall be
judged at the last day: though finally in the doctrine of sanctification we
urge the necessity and profit of good works as much as ever any other
Christians, whether old or new: yet in the question of justification, if our
works or our inherent righteousness be obtruded as the matter of our
justification, and merit of salvation, then do we loathe and abhor them as
polluted clouts, we renounce them as things of no value, we esteem them (or
at least, as Luther said the opinions of them) as loss: And contrariwise our
whole affiance for our justification, and all our hope of salvation we do
entirely repose in the only mercies of God and merits of Christ ou^ most
perfect and all-sufficient Savior, to whom with the Father and the Holy Spirit
be all praise and glory for evermore.

Amen.
