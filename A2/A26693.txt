AN ADMONITION TO THE READERS.
I Am not insensible, that this little tract may seem to many, as a thing born
out of due time. But they that have their spiritual senses exercised, and have
seen and tasted, how jejune, and lifeless, and insipid the more public
exercises of religion somewhere are; will be easily convinced, that now they
are called to double their diligence in family duties. And since it is the great
charge of Householders ( Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7.
), to teach their Children, and their ( Genesis 18, 19.
), households after them, and to ( Prove. 22. 6. the margin.
) catechize them in the way wherein they should go (whereunto the present
exigencies, do more than ordinarily oblige them) it may not seem altogether
unseasonable, to have added this plain and familiar help for their assistance.

If therefore the earnest Calls of your suffering Ministers, the dreadful
Charge of immortal souls, the strict Commands of your Maker and Judge, have
engaged you in a resolution to set up this much neglected, but necessary and
most beneficial exercise, let me advise you to take this plain method. First,
let those under your charge learn the Answers in the Assemblies Catechism, Then
ask them these little Questions drawn from thence, and if they are at a loss,
show them out of which part of the greater Answer, they should have made return
to the lesser Question. And this would be the more effectual, if you did run
over all a second time, that they might observe the force of every clause and
word in the Answer out of the Assembly, before you pass to examine them further
on. Do not put them upon learning the Scriptures, till they ean get through all
the Chatechism, and then examine them, how they can prove such or such a clause
in the answer, leaving the order that the Scriptures ly in. And as ever you
desire to see the happy issue, of this most useful exercise.

1. Let it be done solemnly, and appoint stated times for the weekly performing
it; and if through necessity, or negligence, you should omit the season, watch
for an opportunity speedily to do it, at least let it be done once the oftener
the next week.

2. Set to every one his task, according to their several capacities, and be
punctual in requiring it, and show your selves as zealous for the doing of Gods
work, as you are for your own. But let not the explicatory Questions and
Answers be learnt without book by any, because this would be a needless burden,
and they are in effect learnt already by them that can give an account of the
Catechism it self.

This I cannot omit, that it is my fervent desire, that not only the younger,
but also the elder sort would become students of the Catechism, and (if able)
commit it to memory. Beloved, would you know wherein you might rejoice the soul
of your Minister, would you do me a pleasure and refresh me in my tribulations
for your sakes? why, herein you may do it. This would be no little pleasure to
me, and (I am sure) no little profit to you. O the miserable defect of
knowledge, even among Professors themselves, for want of humility and diligence
to commit to memory the principles of religion?

There is a twofold knowledge; Confused and Distinct; The confused knowledge is
only to know the quod sit, that there is such or such a thing: and here, too
often, many Professors rest. The distinct knowledge is, to understand the quid
sit, and to be able to give a description of any grace, privilege, or the like,
and the difference of it from any other; and also the cur sit, or the ground or
reason from the Scripture, why they do believe such or such a truth: and here
men do (generally) unhappily fail.

Beloved, my ambition is, that you should grow in grace, and the knowledge of
our Lord Jesus Christ, that you should be clear and distinct in your knowledge,
that there should not not be one among you, but should be able to give a good
account of his faith from the Word of Truth. Verily, it is no small shame for
men of years, under the Gospel (especially for Professors, and this when we
have yet such easy and excellent helps) not to be able to prove the main point
of our religion from the Scriptures, and to give a solid description of faith,
repentance, justification, sanctification, effectual calling, and the like;
which will never be done to purpose, except they will learn a Catechism. If any
think themselves above it, I fear it is from their pride and ignorance: for my
part, I profess my self a learner. Well, will you learn with me? why should you
not stir up each other, and engage together, that you will set to this work? O
that I might but hear that you would so far gratify the request of a Messenger
of Christ, and his Ambassador to youward.

An Addition of some brief Directions for the Morning.
D. 1. If through necessity or carelessness you have omitted the reading and
weighing of these questions in the Evening, be sure to do it now. D. 2. Ask
your self, what sin have I committed? what duty have I omitted? Against which
of these Rules have I offended in the day foregoing? And renew your repentance,
and double your watch. D. 3. Examine whether God were last in your thoughts
when you went to sleep; and first, when you awoke. D. 4. Enquire whether your
care of your heart and ways does increase upon your constant using of this
course for self-examination, or whether it does abate, and you grow more
remiss. D. 6. Impose a task of some good meditation upon your selves while you
are making ready, either to go over these Rules in your thoughts, or the heads
of the Sermon you heard last, or the holy meditations for the purpose in the
practice of Piety, or Scudders daily walk. D. 6. Set your ends right for all
that day. D. 7. Set your watch, especially against those sins and temptations
that you are like to be most incident to, that day.
To the most endeared People, the Inhabibitants of Taunton; Salvation.
Most dearly beloved and longed for, my Joy and Crown.
MY hearts desire, and prayer for you is, that Romans 10. 1.
you may be saved. This is that which I have been praying, and studying, and
preaching for these many years; and this is the end of my venturing, and
suffering, and writing at this prsent time. God that knows all things, he
knows that this is my wish; Oh that I could but come at your souls! And that
this is the prize and the gain that I run for, that I might win souls. I seek
not other gifts give me your hearts, let me but part between your sins and you;
suffer me but to save you. Give me leave to carry you over to Jesus Christ, and
I will not ask you any more. I will serve you gladly, I will suffer for you
thankfully, so I may but save you. Do not wonder why I follow you so
pressingly, why I call upon you so frequently; let not my importunity be
grievous to you; all this is but to save you. Christ did not bethink his blood,
and shall I bethink my breath, or ink, in order to your salvation? What pity is
it, that any of you should miscarry at last, under the power of ignorance, or
by a profane negligence, or a formal and lifeless profession of strict
godliness.

Beloved, I am afraid of you, lest (as to many of you) I have run in vain. I
cannot but most thankfully acknowledge, that (considering the paucity of these
that are saved) there are not a few of you who are the joy of your Ministers
and the glory of Christ. But it cannot be dissembled, that far the greater
number give little ground to hope, that they are in the state of salvation. And
must not this be a pinching thought, to a compassionate teacher, to think, that
he cannot for his heart persuade men but that the most of them will wilfully
throw away themselves? Is it not a woeful sight, to behold the devils driving a
great part of our miserable flocks, (as they did once the herd of swine, the
keepers themselves amazed looking on,) I say driving them violently down the
hill, till they be choked in the water, and drowned irrecoverably in the gulf
of endless perdition? Ah miserable spectacle! what through the looseness and
sensuality of some, what throngh the wilful blindness of others, what through
the halving, and cold, and customary religion of others, how great a number of
our flocks is Satan like to carry utterly away from us, after all that has
been done to save them?

Yet I cannot but call after them. Hearken unto me, O ye Children. How long
will you Psalm. 4. 2.
love vanity, and follow after leasing, and Jer. 7. 4.
trust in lying words? As the Lord lives you are lost, except you turn: Ezekiel.
18.
wherefore turn your selves and live ye. Ah how mercy woeth you! how it waits
to be gracious to you! Hear, O sinners, hear. See you not how the merciful
Savior of the world stretches forth his hands all the day long, and spreads
forth his wings, and calls you as a hen does her chicken? Hear you not the
soundings of his bowels? he has no need of you; yet how do his compassions
melt over perishing sinners? his Hos. 11. 8.
heart is turned within him, and shall not this turn your hearts? his
repentings are kindled together? and shall not this lead you to repentance?
Rev. 3. 20.
Behold, he stands at the door and knocks. O man will thou keep Jesus at
the door, and lodge Barabbas in thy bosom? and prefer thy cruel lusts, before
thy compassionate Lord? Oh his melting love to sinners! he Isa. 55. 1.
calls after them, he Luke 19. A1, 42.
weepeth over them, he Prove. 1. 21, 22, 23.
cries to them; How long ye simple ones, will you love simplicity? Jer. 13. 27.
will you not be made clean? when shall it once be? why will you die? Turn you
at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you. Sinner, art thou not
yet melted? Oh come in at his loving calls. Come out from thy sins: touch the
scepter of grace and live: why should thou be Psalm. 2. 9, 12.
dashed in pieces by his iron rod? kiss the Son: why should thou perish in
the way? set up Jesus as thy King, lest he count thee for his Luke 19. 27.
enemy, because thou would that he should not reign over thee, and so thou
be called forth and slain before him. Oh how dreadful will this case be to
perish under the pitiful eyes of his mercy, and to die by the hand of a
Savior! Oh double hell, to have thy redeemer become thine executioner! and the
hand that was so long stretched forth to save thee, to be now stretched forth
to slay thee! and the merciful heart of Christ himself hardened against thee, so
as that he should call thee forth, and with his own hand hew thee in pieces,
(as Samuel did Agag) before the Lord.

But I have been too too long in prefacing to what I intended forthwith to have
fallen upon: indeed I am apt to run out in matters that do so nearly touch upon
your greatest concernments.

Beloved, I despair of ever bringing you to salvation, without sanctification:
or possessing you of happiness, without persuading you to holiness. God knows I
have not the least hope ever to see one of your faces in heaven, except you be
converted and sanctified, and exercise your selves unto godliness. This is that
I drive at. I beseech you study to further personal godliness and family
godliness.

1. Personal godliness. Let it be your first care to set up Christ in your
hearts. See that you make all your worldy interests to stoop to him, that you
be entirely and unreservedly devoted unto him. If you Psalm. 68. 21.
wilfully and deliberately and ordinarily harbor any sin, you are undone? See
that you unfeignedly Ezekiel. 18. 20.
take the Laws of Christ, as the rule of your words, thoughts, and actions; and
subject your Psalm. 119. 34.
whole man, members and mind faithfully to him. If you have not a true respect
to Psalm. 11. 6.
all Gods Commandments, Romans 6. 13.
you are unsound at heart. Oh study to get the image and impress of Christ upon
you within. Begin with your hearts, else you build without a foundation. Labor
to get a saving change within, or else all external performances will be to no
purpose. And then study to show forth the power of godliness in the life. Let
piety be your first and great business. It Is the highest point of Justice, to
give God his due. Beware that none of you be a Prayer-less person: for that is
a most certain discovery of a Christless and Psa. 14. 4 Job 15. 4.
a graceless person, of one that is a very stranger to the fear of God. Suffer
not your Bibles to gather dust. See that you Joh. 5. 39.
converse daily with the word. That man can never lay claim to blessedness,
whose Psa. 1. 1, 2
delight is not in the Law of the Lord. Let meditation and self-examination be
your daily exercise, else the Papists, yea, the Pagans, will condemn us. That
the short questions, which I have given you as a help to self-examination, may
be daily perused by you, is the matter of my passionate request unto you. If
ever you come to any growth in holiness, without the constant use of this
practice, I am grossly deceived; and therefore I would beseech, yea, even charge
you, by the Lord, that you would daily examine your selves by these questions,
till you have found a better help to this duty.

But Piety, without Charity, is but the half of Christianity, or rather impious
hypocrisy. We may not divide the Tables. See therefore that you do justly, and
love mercy, and let Equity and Charity run like an even thread, throughout all
your dealings. Be you temperate in all things, and let Chastity and Sobriety be
your undivided companions. Let Truth and Purity, Seriousness and Modesty,
Heavenliness and Gravity, be the constant ornaments of your speech. Let
patience and humility, simplicity and sincerity shine out in all the parts of
your conversations. See that you forget and forgive wrongs, and requite them
with kindness, as you would be found children of the most High. Be merciful in
your censures, and put the most favorable construction upon your brethrens
carriage, that their actions will reasonably bear. Be slow in promising,
punctual in fulfilling. Let meekness and innocence, affableness, yieldingness,
and courtesy, commend your conversations to all men. Let none of your
relations want that love and loyalty, that reverence and duty, that tenderness,
care, and vigilance, which their several places and capacities call for. This
is throughout godliness. I charge you before the most high God, that none of
you be found a swearer, or a liar, a lover of evil company, or a scoffer, or
malicious, or covetous, or a drunkard, or a glutton, unrighteous in his
dealing, unclean in his living, or a quarreller, or a thief, or a backbiter, or
a railer: for I denouce unto you from the living God, that Prove. 13. 20.
destruction and damnation is the end of all such. Ja^. 5. 12.


2. Family godliness. He that has set up Christ in Rev. 21. 8.
his heart, will be sure to study to set him up in his 1 Cor. 6. 9, 10.
house. Let every family with you be 1 Cor. 16. 19.
a Christian Church; every house, a house of Prayer; every Gal. 5. 19. 20, 21.
household, a household of faith. Let every householder say, with Johua, Joh. 24.
15.
I and my house will serve the Lord; and resolve with David, Psalm. 101 2.
I will walk within my house with a perfect heart. Let me press upon you a few
duties, which I have been long harping upon, but alas (I speak it to your
shame) with many (too too many) of you, to little purpose in general.

First, Let Religion be in your families, not as a matter by the by (to be
minded at leisure, when the world will give you leave) but the standing
business of the house. Let them have your prayers as duly as their meals; is
there any of your families, but have time for their taking food? wretched man!
can thou find time to eat it, and not find time to pray in?

Secondly, settle it upon your hearts, that your souls are bound up in the
souls of your family. They are committed unto you, and (if they be lost through
your neglect) will be required at your hands. Sirs, if you do not, you shall
know, that the charge of souls is a heavy charge, and that the blood of souls
is a heavy guilt. O man, have thou a charge of souls to answer for, and do
thou not yet bestir thy self for them, that their blood be not found in thy
skirts? will thou do no more for immortal souls, then thou will do for thy
beasts that perish? What do thou do for thy children, and servants? Thou
providest meat and drink for them, agreeable to their natures, and do thou
not the same for thy beasts? Thou give them medicines, and cherishest them
when they be sick, and do thou not as much for thy swine? more particularly.

1. Let the Isa. 34. 16 Joh. 5. 39.
solemn reading of the word and Psalm. 118. 15.
singing of Psalms, be your family exercises.

2. Let every person in your families be duly called to an account, of their
profiting by the word So Christ singing with his family, viz. his Disciples,
Mat. 26. 30 Luke 9. 18.
heard or read, as they be about doing your own business. This is a duty of
consequence unspeakable, and would be a means to bring those under your charge,
to remember and profit by what they receive. See Chists example in calling his
family to an account, Mat. 16. 11. 13. 15.

3. Often take an account of the souls under your care, concerning their
spiritual Herein you must be followers of Christ, Mat. 13. 10 36. 51.
estates, make inquiry into their conditions, insist much upon the sinfulness
and misery of their natural estate, and upon the necessity of regeneration and
conversion, in order to their salvation. Admonish them gravely of their sins,
encourage beginnings. Follow them earnostly, and let them have no quiet for
you, till you see them in a saving change. This is a duty of high Mark 4. 10,
11.
consequence, but (I am afraid) fearfully neglected, even by some that are
godly. Does not Conscience say, Thou art the man?

4. Look to the strict sanctifying of the Sabbath Exodus 20. 19.
by all your households. Many poor families have little time else. O improve but
your Sabbath days Lev. 23. 3.
as diligently in laboring for knowledge, and doing your Makers work, as you do
the other days in doing your own work, and I doubt not, but you may come to
some proficiency.

5. Let the Psalm. 92. 1, 2.
Morning and Evening Sacrifice of solemn Prayer, be daily offered up in all
pour families. Beware they be not found among the families Exodus 30. 7, 8.
that call not upon Gods name; for why should there be Jer. 10. 25.
wrath from the Lord upon your families? Luke 1. 9, 10.
O miserable families, without God in the world, that are without family
Prayer! What have you so many family sins, family wants, family mercies, what
and yet no family Prayers? How do you pray with Ephesians. 6. 18.
All prayer and supplication, if you do not with family prayer? Say not, I have
no time. What have thou all thy time on purpose to serve God, and save thy
soul? and yet is this for which thou can find no time. Find but a heart, and
I will find time. Pinch out of your meals, and sleep, rather than want for
Prayer. Say not, my business will not give leave. This is the greatest business
to save thy self, and the souls committed to thee. Besides, a whet will be no
let. In a word, the Jer. 29. 11, 12.
blessing of all is to be got by prayer; and what is thy business without Gods
blessing? Say not, I am 2 Samuel 7. 29.
not able. Use the Mat. 25. 24, etc.
one talent, and God will increase. Helps are to be had, till thou art better
able. But if there be no other remedy, thou must join with thine abler
neighbor. God has special g Jam. 5. 14 to 19.
regard to joint-prayer, and therefore you must improve family advantages for
the performing of it. Acts 12. 5. 10. 12.


6. Put every one in your families upon private 2 Cor. 1. 11.
prayer. Observe whether they do perform it. Get them the help of a form, if
they need it, till they are able to go without it. Direct them how to pray, by
minding them of their sins, wants, and mercies, the materials of prayer. This
was the practice of John, and of Jesus, Luke 11. 1, 2, etc.

7. Set up Catechizing in your Families, at the least once every week. It was
my parting, dying request, that you would set up and maintain this duty
constantly in your families. Have you done it all accordingly? Cannot your
consciences witness, cannot your families witness you have not? Well, I thought
my parting words would have done something with you: I hoped the fervent
request of a dying Minister, would have prevailed for such a small matter with
you. What, to this day without solemn catechizing in yonr houses? Ah, what a
discouragement to your Teacher is this? Brethren, shall I yet prevail with you?
will you reject me now also? O let me persuade you, before you take off your
eyes from these lines, to resolve to set upon the constant exercise of this
duty. Surely I have done and suffered more for you than this comes to: will you
now deny me? I beseech you let me find, if ever God do again bring me to visit
your houses, that the words of a suffering Minister have some power with you. I
have sent you an help on purpose: what, shall all my persuasions be but
speaking in the wind? and all my pains but laboring in the fire? Beloved, have
you no dread of the Almighties charge, That you should Deuteronomy. 6. 6, 7, 8, 9. and
4. 9, 10. and 11. 18, 19, 20.
teach these things diligently to your children, and talk of them as you sit in
your houses, etc. and Pro. 22. 6 The margin.
train them up in the way wherein they should go. Has God so commended Abraham
that Genesis 18. 19.
he would teach his children and household, and that he had Genesis 14, 14. the
margin.
many instructed servants, and given such a promise to him thereupon, and will
not you put in for a share neither in the praise, nor the promise? Has Luke 2.
46.
Christ honored catechizing with his presence, and will not you own it with
your practice? Say not, they are careless, and will not learn. What have you
your authority for, if not to use it for God, and the good of their souls? You
will call them up, and force them to do your work; and should you not at least
be as zealous in putting them upon Gods work? Say not, they are dull, and are
not capable: If they be dull, God requires of you the more pains and patience;
but so dull as they are, you will make them to learn how to work; and can they
not learn as well how to live! Are they capable of the mysteries of your trade,
and are they not capable of the plain principles of Religion? well, as ever you
would see the growth of religion, the cure of ignorance, the remedy of
profaneness, the downfall of error, fulfill you my joy in going through with this
duty.

I have been too long already, and yet I am afraid my letter will be ended
before my work be done. How loath am I to leave you, before I have prevailed
with you to set to the work to which you are here directed will you pass your
promise? will you give me your hands? Oh that you would! you cannot do me a
greater pleasure. Ask what you will of me. See if I will not do as much for
you. Oh that your families might be a joy to me, as that twice noble Ladies to
John; who professes he had no greater joy, then to find her children walking in
the truth! Beloved, why should you not give the hand one to another, and
mutually engage each to other, for more vigorous and diligent endeavors, in
promoting family godliness. I must tell you, God looks for more than ordinary
from you, in such a day as this. He expects that you should do, both in your
hearts, and in your houses, somewhat more than ever, under these his
extraordinary dispensations; my most dearly beloved, mine own bowels in the
Lord, will you satisfy the longings of a traveling Minister? will you answer
the calls of divine providence? would you remove the incumbent, or prevent the
impending calamities? would you plant nurseries for the Church of God? would
you that God should build your houses, and bless your substance? would you that
your children should bless you? that your Father should bless you? Oh then set
up Piety in your families as ever you would be blessed, or be a blessing; let
your hearts and your houses be the temples of the living God, in which his
worship (according to all the forementioned directions) may be, with constancy
reverently performed. Pardon my prolixity, and importunity in so earnest
pursuing of you, I am yet afraid I have done too soon, and shall end without my
errand. The Lord God persuade you. To him I turn me; for I am well assured he
can prevail with you.

O Father of Spirits, that have set me over thy flock to watch for their souls
as one that must give an account. I have long studied thy will, and taught in
thy name, and do unfeignedly bless thee, that any have believed my report. I
have given unto them the words which thou gave me, and they have received
them. I have manifested thy name unto them, and they have kept thy word. And
now I am no more with them, but I come unto thee: Holy Father, keep them
through thine own name, for they are thine. As they have kept the word of thy
patience, so keep thou them in the hour of temptation. They are but a flock, a
little and a helpless flock: but thou art their shepherd, suffer them not to
want. Do thou feed them and fold them. Let thy rod and thy staff comfort them,
and let not the beasts of prey fall upon them to the spoiling of their souls.

But what shall I do for them that will not be gathered. I have called after
them but they would not answer. I have charged them in thy name, but they would
not hear. I have studied to speak perswasively to them, but I cannot prevail.
Yea, I said I have labored in vain, I have spent my strength for naught, and
in vain, yet I cannot give them over, much less may I give thee over. Lord
persuade Japhet, to dwell in the tents of Shem. Lord compel them to come in,
and lay the hands of mercy upon them, as thou did on lingering Lot, and bring
them forth, that they may escape for their lives, and not be consumed. Lord, I
pray thee, open their eyes that they may see, and lay hold upon their hearts by
thine omnipotent grace. Do thou turn them, and they shall be turned. O bring
back the miserable captives, and suffer not the enemy of mankind to drive away
the most of the flock before mine eyes, and to deride the fruitless endeavors
of thy laborers, and boast over them, that he can do more with them, though he
seek to ruin them, than all the beseechings, counsels, and charges of thy
servants that seek to save them. Lord, if I could find out any thing that would
pierce them, that would make its way into their hearts, thou know I would
use it. But I have been many years pleading thy cause in vain. O let not these
endeavors also be lost. O God, find out every ignorant, every profane sinner,
every prayerless soul, and every prayerless family, and convince them of their
miserable condition, while without thee in the world. Set thy image upon their
souls, set up thy worship in their families. Let not pride, ignorance, or
slothfulness, keep them in neglect of the means of knowledge. Let thine eyes be
over the place of my desires for good, from one end of the year to the other
end thereof. Let every house therein be a seminary of Religion, and let those
that cast their eyes upon these lines, find thee sliding in by the secret
influence of thy grvce into their hearts, and irresistibly engaging them to do
thy pleasure.
