A Word to the WORLD.
FRom the Spirit of Truth, as a tender visitation of my Fathers love, that they
may yet return unto him that is able to save from sin and iniquity, and no
longer resist the Spirit of truth within them, which yet striveth with them,
that they may no longer feed on vain imaginations, which profits nothing; for
I have seen your abominations in the Light of the Lord, and that you are not
accepted by him, neither will he always strive with you, to call you to
repentance; but for his Seed's sake he once more calls you, if ye will
hearken, and not be rebellious, but hearken diligently, that your souls may
live in the day of the Lord, which hasteneth, wherein nothing but that which is
of himself shall be accepted: I say, it is that which his own right hand has
planted, that shall see his presence which will be glorious to that part which
is of himself; for unto that all minds must be gathered, which teaches to deny
ungodliness and worldly lusts, and leads into all truth; for he alone is able
that reproves for sin, to lead out of sin; for his Arm is not shortened that he
cannot save, nor his ear heavy, that he cannot hear; for he lives and works as
in the days of old, and delights to do good as much as ever, and waits to
be gracious to his people; he has not forgot his promise, that he would show
mercy unto the rebellious, and that he would bring back the captivity of Zion,
and dress his Vinyard himself, and send forth Pastors of his own, that shall
delight to do his will.

Wherefore return you wanderers, unto the good Shepherd, that you may be led
out of darkness into the liberty of the sons of God with me, to lie down in
peace where none can make you afraid; but as you turn and fly from him that
reproves sin in the gate, so you turn and fly from him that would lead you
into safety, peace and pure obedience, and to wait to do the will of God in all
things, and not your own; for I declare in the moving of the Spirit of the
Lord, that unless you come to witness in you that birth destroyed which is of
the flesh, you cannot come to partake of that peace which is everlasting;
therefore whilst you have a day, prize it; and no longer turn the Grace of God
into wantonness; for he will yet have mercy, and repent of the evil that he
has against you: And therefore fear before the living God who created all
things for his service, and to be at his command; for when God created Adam,
and set him in Paradise, he said, Touch not of the Tree of knowledge of good
and evil, which command he broke, and so was driven out of Paradise from the
peace.

And so my Friends, you that are not acquainted with the way to an endless
life, wait in that which shows you in secret the evil; that is the way which
will lead you into all truth; even to as many as believe in it, and patiently
wait in ^t, they shall see salvation from the lowest depth, and they shall
witness with me, that he alone is able to work a great work, and to deliver the
seed in bondage, which travelleth for deliverance, that it may come to have the
Heirship unto whom it belongs to have the pre-eminence in all things, who
alone is worthy of all honor and glory both now and for ever and ever, Amen.

A Word to the Episcopal people (so called) who have not slain the Witness, by
making War against the Light
THe Message of everlasting peace is come, if you will hearken to it, and not
fly the Cross of Christ, which is the Power of God unto salvation to as many
as believe in it, and patiently wait in it, to be led and guided by it who is
come to destroy sin in the creature, and to set up the Kingdom of
Righteousness: Therefore haste, haste, haste out of Babylon at God's call,
before a day of bitter howling overtake you, which you shall not escape except
ye repent, the Lord has spoken it; Wherefore slight not your call, but turn to
the Lord your God with all your heart, and cease from sin, and wait to know the
voice of the good Shepherd, that his will may be done in earth as it is in
Heaven, and not your own in any thing; for strait is the way that leads unto
life, and few there be that find it: But a certain number there be that have
found it, praises be to his Name for evermore, who in his everlasting love has
visited us, and brought a remnant out of Egypt, and he will bring more that
shall praise his Name, as I do this day: Therefore sleep not, but be awakened
unto life eternal; for this is the day that God calls to you by his servant,
that has tasted of the loving kindness of the Lord, and I am made to invite
you to taste of this Heavenly Treasure, that you may eat and be satisfied, that
your souls may live and be nourished up unto life Eternal; for he alone is able
to feed you, that says, I am the way, the truth, and the life, even Christ
Jesus the Light of the world, that enlighteneth every one that comes into the
world, even he that was dead, and is alive, and lives for evermore, who is
come to judge the world in righteousness. Therefore in the uprightness of my
heart, and in love have I written,

who am a lover of your souls. Mary Anderdon

sake.
