A new Ballad, declaring the great Treason conspired against the young King of
Scots, and how one Andrew Brown an Englishman, which was the Kings
Chamberlain, prevented the same.
To the tune of Milfield, or else to Greenesleeues.
JEsus God what a grief is this,
that Princes subjects cannot be true:
But still the Devil has some of his,
will play their parts whatsoever ensue.
Forgetting what a grievous thing,
It is to offend the anointed King:
Alas for woe, why should it be so,
This makes a sorrowful heigh ho.
In Scotland is a bonie King,
as proper a youth as need to be:
Well given to every happy thing,
that can be in a King to see.
Yet that unlucky country still,
Has people given to crafty will,
Alas for woe, etc.
On Whitson Eve it so befell,
a Posset was made to give the King:
Whereof his Lady Nurse hard tell,
and that it was a poisoned thing.
She cried and called piteously:
Now help or else the King shall die.
Alas for woe, etc.
One Brown that was an English man,
and hard the Ladies piteous cry:
Out with his Sword, and besturd him than,
out of the doors in haste to fly.
But all the doors were made so fast,
Out of a window he got at last.
Alas for woe, etc.
He met the Bishop coming fast,
having the Posset in his hand:
The sight of Brown made him aghast,
who bad him stoutly stay and stand.
With him were two that ran away,
For fear that Brown would make a fray.
Alas for woe, etc.
Bishop quoth Brown what have thou there,
nothing at all my friend said he:
But a Posset to make the King good cheer,
is it so said Brown, that will I see,
First I will have thy self begin,
Before thou go any further in,
Be it weal or woe it shall be so,
This makes a sorrowful heigh ho.
The Bishop said, Brown I do know,
thou art a young man poor and bare:
Livings on thee I will bestow,
let me go on take thou no care.
No no quoth Brown I will not be
A Traitor for all Christiantie,
Hap well or woe, it shall not be so,
Drink now with a sorrowful heigh ho*
The Bishop drank, and by and by,
his belly burst and he fell down:
A just reward for his traytery,
this was a Posset in deed quoth Brown,
He serched the Bishop and found the keys,
To come to the King when he did please,
Alas for woe, etc.
As soon as the King gat word of this,
he humbly fell upon his knee:
And praised God that he did miss,
to taste of that extremity.
For that he did perceive and know,
His Clergy would betray him so:
Alas for woe, etc.
Alas he said unhappy Realm,
my Father and Godfather slain:
My Mother banished O extreme,
unhappy fate and bitter bayne.
And now like Treason wrought for me,
What more unhappy Realm can be.
Alas for woe, etc.
The King did call his Nurse to his grace,
and gave her twenty pound a year:
And trusty Brown to in like case,
he Knighted him with gallant geere*
And gave him livings great,
For doing such a manly feat:
As he did shoe, to the Bishops woe,
which made, etc.
When all this Treason don and past,
took not effect of Traytery:
Another Treason at the last,
they sought against his Majesty.
How they might make their King away:
By a privy banquet on a day.
Alas for woe, etc.
Whereat they meant to sell the King,
beyond the seas it was decreede*
Three noble Earls heard of this thing,
and did prevent the same with speed.
For a Letter came, with such a charm,
That they should do their King no harm:
For further woe, if they did so,
Which made a sorrowful heigh hoe.
The Earl Mourton, told the Douglas then,
take heed you do not offend the King:
But show your selves like honest men,
obediently in every thing.
For his Godmother will not see,
Her noble Child misusde to be.
With any woe, for if it be so:
She will make a sorrowful heigh ho.
God grant all subjects, may be true,
in England, Scotland, and every where:
That no such danger may ensue,
to put the Prince or state in fear.
That God the highest King may see,
Obedience as it ought to be.
In wealth or woe, God grant it be so,
To avoid the sorrowful heigh ho.
