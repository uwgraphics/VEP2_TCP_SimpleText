By the Queen.
THE Queens Highness upon many great considerations for the benefit of her
Common weal, does will and straightly command all manner of persons of what
condition so ever they be, otherwise then such as be, or shall be excused by
unfeigned sickness, or licenced by the authority of her Majesty, or her
Progenitors: to abstain from killing, dressing, or eating of any flesh, upon
all such usual Fasting days, and namely the time commonly called the Lent,
upon pain of her Majesty's indignation and imprisonment during her Majesty's
pleasure, and such further fine as therefore shall seem meet.

FOR the better execution whereof, her Majesty charge all Justices of Peace,
and all Majors, Bailiffes, and head officers of Cities and Towns corporate,
especially of her Cities of London, and Westminster, upon proof by two
sufficient witnesses before them had, to commit the offenders thereof to
prison, there to remain during her Majesty's pleasure, and to make fine for
the same accordingly.

AND finally her Majesty wills and requires all such as shall be upon
necessity and just cause licenced as above is said, that as they regard her
Majesty's favor, they will use the same as modestly and secretly as they may,
both to avoid excess, and evil example.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster, the vij. day of February, the first year
of Our Reign. God save the Queen.
Imprinted at London by Richard Judge, and John Cawoodde, Printers to the
Queens Majesty.

Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.
