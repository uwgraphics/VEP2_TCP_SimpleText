By the King.
ALthough it cannot be without grief to us to publish, that in this our
Kingdom we should find any Subject so contrary to all the rest of our loving
people, who in so great multitudes have made perfect proof of their unspotted
lyaltie to us: Yet has there such an accident happened so farce beyond our
expectation, as We could not conceal it without prciudice to our Self, and
our Estate, whereof we assure our Sclues, that al our good subjects will be very
sensible, That is, that it has been discovered to Us by several persons, that
our Anthony Copley, the younger brother of one Copley that is lately returued
from foreign parts unto this Country, has dealt with some to be of a
conspiracy to use some violence upon our Person, whereby must either have
followed peril to our life, or danger of innovation in our State. Which
Anthony Copley, having been sought for since his practicing with others, by the
ordinary Officers and ministers our State, in places about our Court, and our
City of London, cannot yet be found: So as it seems he lurketh very closely,
awayting opportunity to attempt his treasonable purposes, or to procure other
of our Subjects to conspire with him in so disioyall a fact.

Wherefore we have found it necessary to make public declaration to all our
people of his wicked purpose, knowing well that all true and loyal Subjects,
howsoever divided from the State in matter of Religion, will abhor so
vngrations and traitorous a mind, of which good affection We require them all
to make proof, by doing their endeuouts to discover and apprchend the said
Anthony Copley wheresoever he may be found: Charging all Lieutenants, Deputy
Lieutenants, Justices of Peace, Majors, Shiriffes, Constables, and all other
our Ministers whomsoever, so be diligent in enquiring and searching for the
said Anthony Copley: whom if they shall happen to take, Our pleasure is they
send him presently to our Privy Counsel, or to some of our ordinary
Magistrates, to abide the trial of our Laws for his fact. And do further
declare, That if any person on our Realm shall conceal, harbor, keep or
maintain the said Anthony Copley, after they have by this our Proclamation, or
otherwise, notice of his traitorous purpose: We must, as there is just cause,
extend against them the power of our indignation, and the rigor of our Laws,
though we shall be sorry to find any such occasion given by any of our Subjects
whom we do hold so dear.

Given at our Honor of Windsor the second day of July, in the first year of
our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and the six and thirtieth of
Scotland.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
