TO MY HONORABLE GOOD FRIEND John Souch Esquire, for many courtesies for which I
imbolden my self, presuming of his good favor, to present this simple work,
as a token of my thankefulnes.
THE estimation and kindness which I have ever bountifully received from your
favor, have moved me to present this nouelty of music to you, who of al
others are fittest to judge of it, and worthiest out of your love to protect
it. If I gave life to these, you gave spirit to me; for it is always the
worthy respect of others that makes art prosper in it self. That I may
therefore profess, and make manifest to the world both your singular affection
to me, and my grateful mind in my weak ability to you, I have here prefixed
your honorable name, as a bulwark of safety, and a title of grace, thinking
my self no way able to deserve your favors more, then by farther engaging my
self to you for this your noble presumed patronage. He that has acknowledged
a favor, they say, has half repaide it: and if such payment may pass for
current, I shall be ever ready to grow the one half out of your debt, though
how that should be I know not, since I owe my self (and more, if it were
possible) unto you. Accept me wholly then I beseech you, in what terms you
please, being ever in my uttermost service

Devoted to your Honors kindness, JOHN DOWLAND.

The Epistle to the Reader.
THE applause of them that judge, is the encouragement of those that write: My
first two books of aires speed so well that they have produced a third, which
they have fetched far from home, and brought even through the most perilous
seas, where having escapt so many sharp rocks, I hope they shall not be wrackt
on land by curious and biting censures. As in a hiue of bees al labor alike to
lay up honny opposing themselves against none but fruitles drones; so in the
house of learning and fame, all good indeuourers should strive to ad somewhat
that is good, not malicing one an other, but altogether bandying against the
idle and malicious ignorant. My labors for my part I freely offer to every
man's judgment, presuming, that favor once attained, is more easily increased
then lost.

I CANTVS.
^ FArewell too fair, too chaste but too too cruel, ^ discretion never
quenched fire with swords: Why have thou made my heart thine angers ^ fuel,
and now would kill my passions with thy words. This is proud beauties true
anatamy, ^ if that se- cure severe in secrecy, farewell, farewell. ^

Farewell too dear, and too too much desired,
Unless compassion dwelt more near thy heart:
Love by neglect (though constant) often is tired,
And forced from bliss unwillingly to part.
This is proud beauties, etc.
BASSVS.
^

II. CANTVS.
^ TIme stands still with ga- zing on her face, ^ stand still and gaze for
minutes, hours and years, to her give place: All other things shall change, ^
but she remains the same, till heavens changed have their course and time
has lost his name. ^ Cupid does houer up and down blinded with her fair
eyes, and fortune captive at her ^ feet contem'd and conquered lies. ^

When fortune, love, and time attend on
Her with my fortunes, love, and time, I honor will alone,
If bloudlesse envy say, duty has no desert.
Duty replies that envy knows her self his faithful heart,
My settled vows and spotless faith no fortune can remove,
Courage shall show my inward faith, and faith shall try my love.
BASSVS.
^

III. CANTVS.
^ BEhold a wonder here Love has received ^ his sight which many hundred * *
years, has not beheld the ^ light. ^

2
Such beams infused be
By Cinthia in his eyes,
As first have made him see,
And then have made him wise.
3
Love now no more will weep
For them that laugh the while,
Nor wake for them that sleep,
Nor sigh for them that smile.
4
So powrefull is the beauty
That Love does now behold,
As love is turned to duty,
That Is neither blind nor bold.
5
This Beauty shows her might,
To be of double kind,
In giving love his sight
And striking folly blind,
BASSVS.

IIII. CANTVS.
^ DAphne was not so chaste as she was changing, Soon begun he that to day
triumphs with favors graced, falls before ^ Love with hate estranging: night
with scorns de- fa- ced: Yet is thy beauty fainde, and every one desires, ^
still the false light the false light of thy traitorous fires. ^

Beauty can want no grace by true love viewed,
Fancy by looks is still renewed:
Like to a fruitful tree it ever grows,
Or the fresh-spring that endless flows.
But if that beauty were of one consent with love,
Love should live free, and true pleasure prove.
BASSVS.
^ Daphne. ^

V. CANTVS*
^ ME me and none but me, dart home O gentle death and quickly, for I draw too
^ long this idle breath: O how I long till I may fly to heaven above, unto my
faithful ^ * and beloved turtle dove. ^

Like to the silver Swanne,
before my death I sing:
And yet alive
my fatal knell I help to ring.
Still I desire from earth
and earthly joys to fly,
He never happy lived,
that cannot love to die.

VI. CANTVS.
^ WHen Phoebus first did Daphne love, and no means might her favor move ^ he
craved the cause, the cause quoth she is, I have vowed virginity. Then in a
rage he swear, ^ and said, past fifteen none none but one should live a maid. ^

If maidens then shall chance be sped
Ere they can scarsly dress their head,
Yet pardon them, for they be loath
To make good Phoebus break his oath.
And better twere a child were borne,
Then that a god should be forswone.

^ SAy love if ever thou did find, a woman with a constant ^ mind, none but
one, and what should that rare mirror be, some Goddess or some Queen is she ^
she she she she * * and only she she only Queen of love and beauty. ^

But could thy fiery poysned dart
At no time touch her spotless heart,
Not come near,
She is not subject to Loves bow,
Her eye commands, her heart says no,
No, no, no, and only no,
One no another still does follow.
How might I that fair wonder know,
That mockes desire with endless no
See the Moon
That ever in one change does grow,
Yet still the same, and she is so;
So, so, so, and only so,
From heaven her virtues she does borrow.
To her then yield thy shafts and bow,
That can command affections so:
Love is free,
So are her thoughts that vanquish thee,
There is no queen of love but she,
She, she, she, and only she,
She only queen of love and beauty.

Weep they apace whom Reason,

Often have I dreamed of joy,
yet I never felt the sweet,
But tired with annoy,

Often have I left my hope,

He that once loves with a true desire
never can depart,
For Cupid is the king of every heart.

X. CANTVS.
^ Love stood amazed at sweet beauties pain: Love would ^ have said that all
was but vain, and Gods but half divine, But when Love saw that beauty ^
would die: he all aghast, to heavens did cry, O gods, O gods what wrong is
mine. ^

2
Then his tears bred in thoughts of salt brine,
Fell from his eyes, like rain in sun shine
expeld by rage of fire:
Yet in such wise as anguish affords,
He did express in these his last words
his infinite desire.
3
Are you fled fair? where are now those eyes
Eyes but too fair, enui'd by the skies,
you angry gods do know,
With guiltles blood your scepters you stain,
On poor true hearts like tyrants you rain:
unjust why do you so?
4
Are you false gods? why then do you rain?
Are you just gods? why then have you slain
the life of love on earth,
Beauty, now thy face lives in the skies,
Beauty, now let me live in thine eyes,
where bliss felt never death
5
Then from high rock, the rock of despair,
He falls, in hope to smother in the air,
or else on stones to burst,
Or on cold waves to spend his last breath,
Or his strange life to end by strange death,
but fate forbid the worst.
6
With pity moved the gods the^ change love
To Phoenix shape, yet cannot remove
his wonted property,
He loves the sun because it is fair,
Sleep he neglects, he lives but by air,
and would, but cannot die.

Once lived, once I knew delight,

Graced with love, cheered with beauties sight,

In Fortunes bolome ever placed.
Cold as Ice frozen is that heart,

Whose weight cleaues to this earthly center,
Mutuallioies in hearts truly united
Do earth to heavenly state convert
Like heaven still in it self delighted.

Where waters smoothest run, deep are the foords,
The dial stirs, yet none perceiues it move:
The firmest faith is in the fewest words,
The Turtles cannot sing, and yet they love,
True hearts have eyes and ears, no tongues to speak:
They hear, and see, and sigh, and then they break.

XX. CANTVS.
^ WHat poor Astronomers are they, take wome^s eyes for stars ^ and set their
thoughts in battle ray to fight such idle wars, when in the end they shall
approve, ^ It Is but a jest drawn out of love. ^

And love it self is but a jest.
Deuisde by idle heads,
To catch young fancies in the neast,
And lay it in fools beds.
That being hatched in beauties eyes,
They may be flidge ere they be wise.
3
But yet it is a sport to see
How wit will run on wheels,
While wit cannot persuaded be
With that which reason feels:
That women's eyes and startes are odd,
And love is but a fained god.
4
But such as will run mad with will,
I cannot clear their sight:
But leave them to their study still,
To look where is no light.
Till time too late we make them try,
They study ^alse Astronomy.
