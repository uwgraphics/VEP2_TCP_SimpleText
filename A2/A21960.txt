By the Queen.
A Proclamation for proceeding against Jesuits and Secular Priests, their
Receivers, Relieuers, and Maintainers.
AS the clemency wherewith we have ever found our heart possessed toward our
Subjects of all sorts, and our desire to avoid all occasions of drawing blood
(though never so justly grounded upon the rules of policy, and vigor of our
Laws) have been a great cause that of late years we have used greater
forbearance from the execution of some Ordinances established by advice of our
Parliaments, for the conservation of the true Religion now professed in our
Kingdoms, and for the resisting of all disturbers and Corrupters of the same,
Especially from foreign parts, and the receivers and harbourers of them, then
the just consideration of the safety of our Estate may welendure, or the
examples of some other Princes, where one form of Religion has ever been only
allowed, do regularly approve: So do we truly confess, that our hope was that
those Romish Priests who were sent into this Realm by foraigne Authority, to
seduce our people from their affection to Religion, and so by consequence from
the constancy of their obedience to us (having felt for a time the severity
of our Laws formerly inflicted) would either by our Clemency have been
moved, or out of their own Judgment have learned to forbear to provoke us to
any sharper course of proceeding, and not so notoriously have abused our mercy,
as they have done. For whilst we in our Princely Commiseration, and pity of
their seduced blindness, held this so mild and merciful a hand over them,
they in the mean time greatly forgetting our patience and lenity, have sought
like unthankful Subjects, the utter ruin both of us and of our Kingdoms, to
the uttermost of their abilities. It is apparent to the world with how great
malice of late our Kingdom of Ireland has been invaded by the King of Spain,
and how Don Giouan (his chief Commander) published a warrant from the Sea of
Rome to deprive us of our Crown, and to proclaim his Master Lord of the same:
The Spaniards themselves having not only declared, but afterward bitterly
complained in their miseries and distresses, that the Secular Priests and
Jesuits, had both of them invited the King their Master to that unfortunate
enterprise, by abusing him grossly with reporting our forces to be so
contemptible, and their own party so powerful, as the conquest of that Realm
was most assured. And that we might not conceive any better hope of them
hereafter, it is in like sort made manifest to the greatest part of Europe (as
we suppose) by their own Books lately published, that they have already very
maliciously and wickedly combined themselves together in this our Realm, for
the advancement of our enemies, the perverting of our Subjects, and as much as
in them lies, the subversion of our Estate, in that almost all the English
Secular Priests by yielding their obedience to a new kind of Subordination
erected amongst them, have in effect subjected themselves to be wholly directed
by the Jesuits (men altogether alienated from their true allegiance to us and
devoted with all their might to the King of Spain,) whereby both the one sort
and the other so linked together, not mindful of their duties to God, to us
their lawful Sovereign, and to our Kingdom their Native Country, are become
most dangerous, and more sedicious (if it may be) then at any time heretofore:
being grown to such an height of impiety, as that they freely in their late
Treatises profess, that our Subjects are bound to sight against us, and to
join their forces with any Enemy that the Pope shall send to subdue us and
our Dominions, under pretense of restoring of the Roman Religion within our
Kingdoms. Besides, such is their pride and presumption, as that they thrust
themselves into all the affairs of our Estate, aduenturing in their writings
and speeches to dispose of our Kingdoms and Crown at their pleasures, if any
of their own sort being of a milder temper, as moved in conscience, do but
seem to acknowledge the lenity of our proceedings and government, it is a
sufficient cause of their hatred and revenge to pursue and prosecute them as
their enemies.

And lest the generation of such wickedly disposed persons should in time be
rooted out or decay, they make an usual market of transporting the youth of our
Realm unto foreign Seminaries, thereby to corrupt the best Families, and to
hatch up a succeeding brood like to themselves, that by libelling, treachery,
and all kind of traitorous practices, may still seek and endeavor to perturbe
and molest us.

And whereas of late much contention and controversy has arisen betwixt the
Jesuits and the Secular Priests combined with them on the one part, and
certain of the Secular Priests dissenting from them in diverse points on the
other part, thereby a great difference of offense against us and our State
betwixt the one and the other sect has manifestly appeared: the Jesuits and
the Secular Priests their adherents seeking and practizing by their continual
plotts and desseignes not only to stir up foreign Princes against us to the
invasion and Conquest of our Kingdom, but also even to murder our person: the
other Secular Priests not only protesting against the same as a thing most
wicked, detestable and damnable, but also offering themselves both in their
writings and speeches to be the first that shall discover such traitorous
intentions against us and our State, and to be the foremost by arms and all
other means to suppress it. So as it is plain that the treason which is
lodged in the hearts of the Jesuits and their adherents is fraughted with much
more violent malice, peril and poison both against us and our State, then that
disloyalty and disobedience which is found in the other Secular Priests that
are opposite therein unto them. In which respect, although we have so conceived
of them, and that we could have been well pleased that the same should further
have appeared in distinguishing betwixt them, by the execution of our Laws:
yet such is likewise their carriage otherwise toward us, as we may not
(according to our natural disposition ready at all times to appprehend the
least cause to show mercy) any longer permit it with the Honor of our State,
good of our Subjects, and safety of our Kingdom. For it is evident, that
howsoever they be at variance with the Jesuits, and that faction; they
concur notwithstanding and agree together in apparent disobedience and
disloyalty against us, masking themselves under the vizard of pretended
conscience (a suggestion of all other most perilous) thereby to steal away
the hearts especially of simple and common Subjects from us their Sovereign,
since under color thereof they labor day and night to win and withdraw
them from their sound and due obedience both to us and our Laws, and to unite
and knit them to our mortal enemy the Pope, increasing thereby his number and
diminishing ours: a matter most dangerous to our State, and not to be endured
in the rule or policy of any well governed Common wealth: The same our enemy
having had as a Temporal Prince his Banner in the field, and still continuing
his warlike stratagems against us.

Furthermore, we cannot conjecture, but do wonder upon what grounds they
proceed (except it be our sufferance and benignity, which is greatly
neglected by them) in that they carry themselves in so great and insolent
animositie, as they do almost insinuate thereby into the minds of all sorts of
people (as well the good that grieve at it, as the bad that thirst after it)
that we have some purpose to grant toleration of two religions within our
Realm, where God (we thank him for it, who sees into the secret corners of
all hearts) does not only know our own innocence from such imagination, but
how far it has been from any about us, once to offer to our ears the
persuasion of such a course, as would not only disturb the peace of the
Church, but bring this our State into confusion. And to the further agrauating
of this their audacious boldness, we find that their said conceit of a
toleration, is accompanied with very great liberty and intolerable
presumption, in that they dare adventure to walk in the streets at noone
days, to resort to prisons publicly, and execute their functions in contempt
of our Laws, never ceasing the one side as well as the other, by these and
many more their intolerable proceedings, to waken our Justice, which for the
respect before mentioned, has lien in a slumber, where in all good policy, it
had been their parts (if ever) by a far contrary course, to have prescribed
to themselves the strictest rules and cautions of giving any such notorious
scandals, to so notable clemency, never moved but by constraint to think upon
any severity. From the which our said mild and mercisul conniuencie toward
such unthankful and inconsiderate persons, we find this further mischief
proceeding, That some other natures (apt to innovation and affected much to
their own opinions) have broken forth on the other side into factious
inuectiues in print, against our present government: whereunto they impute
such remissnes, as if no care were had by any, but a few of themselves, to
preserve Religion. Of which pamphlets or any other to come forth in like
kind, as we would quickly make the authors (if they were laid open) to feel
the weight of our indignation, in presuming to take upon them to censure our
government, according to their vain conceits, whereby they both iniure our
innocence, and scandalize many other good and zealous persons, which are free
from their unquiet humors, though opposite to the adverse part: so to avoid
(in some sort) all these inconveniences, mischiefs, murmurings, and heart
burnings in this Realm, (The government whereof has been and is as well in
temporal as Ecclesiastical things most firmly established by general
consent in Parliament) We have thought it necessary to give some general
notice to our servants and officers put in trust in our several countries for
the government of our people, how much we mislike it, That many of them
conceiving more of this late cessation of Justice, then there was cause, have
been so remiss in preventing the resort of secular Priests and Jesuits into
places where they have authority, as they have seldom made searches for them,
or taken pains in apprehending them, as in former times was used to be done,
and as the Laws of the Realm do require. And therefore we have resolved to
publish this our Admonition and commandment, whereby we first require and
charge all Jesuits and secular Priests combined together, as is before
expressed, who are at liberty within this our Realm (by whose sole Act of
their very coming into this kingdom, they are within the danger of our Laws)
That they do forthwith depart out of our Dominions and Territories, and not by
their abode any longer, provoke us to extend the rigor of our Laws upon them.

And that the other sort also of the Secular Priests (that are at liberty and
in some things opposite unto the Jesuits) do likewise in the same respect,
depart out of our Dominions and Territories, betwixt this and the first of
January next eusuing, except such of them as shall in the mean time present
themselves to some of the Lords or others of our privy Counsel, to our
presidents of Wales and York, or to the Bishops of the Diocesses, and before
them acknowledging sincerely their duty and allegiance unto us, shall submit
themselves to our mercy, with whom we will then (upon certificate from the said
Presidents and Bishops, which we require to be sent up to our Counsel within
xx. days after such submission) take such further order, as shall be thought by
us to be most meet and convenient. Next, we do warn and command both al those
who shall hereupon depart, as also all other Romish Priests, be they Secular or
Religious, as well Jesuits as of any other order (being our subjects) now
already out of our Realm, That they presume not to return into our kingdom,
upon any pretense whatsoever. For which purpose also, we do hereby give notice
unto all our Ministers to whom the administration of Justice is committed, That
if the Jesuits and Secular Priests combined with them, shall not within thirty
days, and the other sort of Secular Priests shall not before the first of
February (except as before is excepted) after this be published within this our
Realm, repair to some known port, and there imbarke themselves for foreign
countries, That then we leave them, their Receivers, Releeuers, and
maintainers, to be dealt and proceeded with, according to the power and Justice
of our Laws, wheresoever they shall be found within the same. And to the end
they may be the sooner avoided from hence, and so our Realm free from the
danger and infection, which is derived from their continual workings upon men's
consciences: we do hereby strictly command and charge all our Lieutenants,
Deputy lieutenants, Commissioners, Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs,
Bailiffs, and all other our officers whatsoever, That they be from henceforth
circumspect and vigilant, each of them in their several charges, to search all
places suspected, or whereof they shall have any information given them, and to
apprehend all such Jesuits and Secular Priests, together with their
Receivers, Releeuers, and maintainers, equally subject to the penalties of our
Laws, And to advertise our Counsel of their proceedings, to the end we may
be informed of the care and diligence which shall be used in that behalf, as
they will answer the contrary at their peril.

Given at our Manor of Richmont, the fist day of November, in the four and
fourtieth year of our Reign.
God save the Queen.
