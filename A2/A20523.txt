THE DOCTRINE OF DYING-VVELL. OR The godly man's Guide to Glory.

Wherein is briefly comprised a short view of the glorious estate of Gods
Saints in the Kingdom of Heaven.

Together with The Means to obtain, the Marks to know, and the Motives to
urge us to prepare our selves for Christ, before our souls be unbodied, lest
Heavens gate be shut against us.

Psalm. 73. 24. Thou shall guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
to Glory. 1 Kings 2. 2. I go the way of all the earth. Printed at London for
F. Co^les. 1628.

The doctrine of dying well. Of Death in general.
WHat man is he that lives, and Genesis 25. 7. 8. and 35. 28. 29. and 49. 33 and
50. 26. Deuteronomy 34. 7. lo^. 24 29. 1 Samuel* 2. 51 1 Kin. 2. 21. 2 Chronicles. 2^. 28. Job

shall not see death; shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave?
Ps. 89 48. And, It is appointed unto men once to dye. Heb. 9. 27. And so death
passed upon all men, Romans 5. 12.

II. For all men must dye. This is clear by these testimonies of holy Writ.
Job. ^0 23. For I know that thou will bring me to death, and to the house
appointed for all the living. Read Job 34. 14. 15. Psalm. 104. 29. Eccles 6. 6.
Esaias 40. 6, 7, 8. Job 14. 2. and 8. 9. Psalm. 102. 11. and 103. 14, 15. and 144.
4. James 1. 10. 1 Pet. 1. 24 Job 17. 13. 14.

III. Examples. Death is the lot of all men: for Abraham dyed, Isaac, Jacob.
Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Samuel, David, Job. Young and old, all that have been
before us have dyed, except Enoch and Eliah, who were translated up into
heaven: and those that now are, or hereafter shall be on the earth, must all
dye, except those that shall These. 4. 6. 17.
be at the last day, who in the twinkling of an eye shall be changed, when
the just shall be caught up in the clouds, and be ever with the Lord. 1 These. 4
16. 17.

IV. Reasons manifest. I. Reason. Reasons. ^ Reason. ^ Kin. 2. 2. 1 Cor. 15, ^0
31.
Josh. 23. 14. because this is the way of all the earth: for every child of
Adam is subject to death daily. Death is the debt that all men owe and this is
the common course of all the living.

II. Reason. Because all are of the 2 Reason. Genesis 3. 19. Job 4. 19. and 7. 12.
13. Ecel. 12. 7 Judge. 16. 28
dust, and all turn to the dust again: there is not any thing in any earthly
creature that can prevent death. Strength cannot withstand it: for Samson was a
mighty strong man, and yet he was overcome by death. Wisdom a most excellent
gift, yet unable to subdue death: for Solomon 2 Kin. 11. 43 2 Chronicles 9. 31.
Psalm. 49: 10. Eccl. 2. 16.
the wisest of mere men, was dispatched by death: for wise men dye as well as
the foolish. Eloquence is not able to charm death: but the most eloquent men
that ever lived, have all dyed, as Tully and Demosthenes. Death says one can
find way into. Princes palaces, into the Courts of Kings, as well as into the
pesants Cottage: for Magistrates are Gods vicegerents, but yet all mortal, and
subject unto Psalm. 86. 7.
death. Death spares not the beautiful: Sarah, Rebecca, Rachel, Ester and
Bersheba Gen, 12. 1^ and 24, 16. and 23. 2. and 29. 17. and 35. 18. 2 Samuel 14
25. 2 Samuel 2. 1^ 50. 51. 2 Samuel 16. 23. and 17. 27. Luk 16. 1^ 22. 23. Psalm 49.
1^ Lucan* (...)
were all beautiful creatures, yet all died, Absolon and Achilles were brave
gallants yet are dead and gone. Asael was as swift as a Roe, yet death ouerwent
him. Goliath was a great Giant, yet death was greater then he* Achitophel was
very politic and subtle, yet was ouer-reacht by death: rich and poor all are
arested of death.

It is recorded, that among many dead carcasses one would know which was Philip
King of Macedon. Answer was made, he that had the bald head is Philip. Al have
bald heads says he. He that has the flat nose is Philip says the other. All
have flat Noses says he. He that has the hollow eyes says the other, and
that has the bare ribs, and rattling bones: but all are such and have such
says he. Then says the other, I perceive there is no difference between the
King and the beggar in death. In a East of compters one has the place of a
pound, another of a shilling, a third of a penny, and every one as he that casts
the count shall think good to lay them: but put them together into the bag and
what difference between those that were worth thousands and those that were
worth nothing? Even so, in the common bag the earth, rich and poor are alike:
for there is none that can be exempted from the dust of death.

III. Reason. Because the w^ges of sin 3 Reason Mat. 16. 27 Psalm. 62. 12 Prou.
24. 12 I^r. 3. 19 Eze. 35. 20. Rom 2. 6. Ezec. 7. 27. 2 Cor. 5. ^0 Col 3. 25. 1

4. 13. Ioh. 14. 28.
is death, Romans 6. 23. And so sin passed upon all men, for all men have
sinned. Rom 5. 12.

IV. Reason. Because the last enemy that shall be destroyed is death. 1 Cor.
15. 16.

V. Reason. Because we shall be changed, 1 Cor. 15. 51. etc.

Uses several. I. Use. That we sorrow not even as others which have no hope,
for when we know that our friends and acquaintance that are dead are departed
in the Lord (for they that die in the Lord are blessed) their death does rather
yield cause of comfort then of sorrow, of rejoicing rather then mourning: for
our Savior says, If ye loved me ye would rejoice because I go to the
Father. Those then that love their friends indeed, have greater cause to
rejoice then mourn, because they go to be glorifled with their heavenly
Father in heaven.

For as a child or simple person, that Simile.
should see a Goldsmith melting pure Gold or Silver, would imagine that all
were quite spoiled, when as the skillful workman has a purpose to cast some
excellent piece of plate: even so, we silly creatures, when the Lord cuts off
some of our friends by death, or melts them in the furnace of the grave, are
overcome with sorrowful conceits, as if some evil thing had betided our
friends, whereas we should remember that the Lord has a purpose by that means
to preserve them, and to transform into the glorious estate with the Angels
M^t. 18. 1^ 1 These. 4. 13
in joy in heaven, where they shall never dye. For as Saint Paul says, I would
not have you ignorant brethren, concerning them that are asleep, etc. 1 These.
4 3. Who Simile.
would be sorry to have his friend fall asleep seeing thereby he is more
fresh, lusty, and lightsome. Now death unto the godly is nothing else but a
sleep, whereby Acts 7. 60.
we are refined and refreshed.

Oh then why should we be offended there with. If our friends be wicked, then
have we just cause of mourning, as David 2 Samuel 18 ^3.
had, 2 Samuel 18. 33. but if we know them to live and dye in the fear of God,
howsoever natural affection may have force to cause us to mourn and shed
tears, and to lament them in respect of the good we have by them, yet we have
reason to rejoice and be glad for their happy change.

For, as if in this world our friends should Simile.
be advanced to some high and honorable place, and be the third in the
Kingdom, as Daniel was, Dan. 2. 48. this would Dan, 2. 48.
much rejoice our hearts. Oh how much more then should we rejoice, when as our
friends are delivered out of this miserable world by death, and are crowned
with glory for ever in the Kingdom of heaven. 2 These. 4 13
To conclude this with that of the Apostle, that ye sorrow not even as others
which have no hope.

II. Use. Luke 12. 40. Be therefore 2 Use. Luke 12. 40.
ready also, for the Son of man comes at an hour when ye think not.
Briefly, for the better manifesting this, viz. that we may be ready for Christ
at his coming, whenever he shall summon us either particularly by death, or
generally by judgment, to enter heavens glory, let us take a serious view of
these particulars which hereupon result. 1. The Means. 2. the Marks. 3. the
Motives.

For the first, to wit, the means. Oh Means, to help us to make ready for
Christ that we may die blessedly, diverse.
but what means must I use, that I may be ready at Christ's coming, that so I
may dye blessedly?

By a diligent use of these Means.

I. Means is, we must seriously think with our selves, that we are but dust
and ashes, made of clay which is frail and brittle, 1 Means Genesis 18. 27 Genesis
3. 19.
and this will make us think, that we cannot long continue here, but that our
bodies of clay, and our earthly tabernacles must needs be dissolved, and that
we have 2 Cor. 5. 1. Heb. 13. 14. Job 4. 19.
here no continuing City. For, our bodies are houses of clay, and the
foundation of them is in the dust.

II. Means. We must aforehand acquaint 2 Means
our selves with death, and so live, that we be still ready to dye, that so we
may say with S. Paul, I dye daily. Thus 1 Cor. 15. 31. Job 17. 14.
did patient Job, If I wait, the grave will be my house, I have made my bed in
the dark. etc. Thus are we to prevent death, as it were, by little and little
depriving our selves of life, not by offering violence to our persons, but by
mortifying our earthly Col 3. 5. Psalm. 119. 37. Psalm. 38. 13.
members. Thus should we cause our eyes to dye, by turning them away from
beholding vanity. Our ears to be as deaf not harkening after the villainies
of the wicked world.

III. Means. We must lay to heart 3 Means
the death of others, that so our hearts may be in the house of mourning: for,
It is better Eccl. 7. 2. 4.
to go to the house of mourning, then to the house of feasting: for it is the
end of all men, and the living will lay it to heart. Therefore if we hear of
any that be dead let us think it might have been our own turn as well as
theirs, and so prepare our Luk 12. 43.
selves daily for Christ that when he comes he may find us so doing. To
which end let us frequent funeral Sermons, for there may we both see with our
eyes, and hear with our ears, that which will put us in mind of our
mortality and end, for every grave and tomb be monuments to put us in mind
of death.

IIII. Means is to pray earnestly, frequently, 4 Means Jonah 3. 8. Psalm. 90.
12. Job 13. 5. Psalm. 39. 4.
zealously, fervently, and mightily unto the Lord, Jonas 3. 8. and continually
unto Almighty God, in the name of Jesus Christ, to teach us to number our days
that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom* Psalm 90. 12.

Secondly, the Marks. Oh but by what marks and tokens may we assertaine our
selves, that we shall be in the glorious ioies Marks to know certainly whether
we be ready for Christ, to enter heavens glory at the dissolution of our vile
bodies, diverse. 1 Mark Romans 8. 19. 20. etc. 2 Cor. 5. 6. Psalm 42. 1. 2
of heaven, with our sweet and blessed Savior, when our souls shall be
vnbodyed? By these marks ensuing.

I Mark. If it be the earnest desire of our hearts to be dissolved, and to be
with Christ Jesus, Phil. 1. 21. and yet in the mean time by faith and hope
wait patiently* expecting the Lords leisure, being contented to live as long as
it shall please him, thinking long till we be at our long home* groaning within
our selves, and waiting for the redemption of our bodies, earnestly longing
after the joys of heaven, as knowing that whilst we are here in the body, we
are absent from the Lord: this longing desire was in David. Psalm. 42. 1. 2.

II. Mark is, If we dye unto sin daily, 2 Mark Col. 3. 5. Tit. 2. 11. 12.
13. Genesis 5. 22. 24. and 7. 1. and 17. 1. Gal 6. 16. Psalm. 1. 2.
and live unto righteousness, continually mortifying our earthly members,
crucifying our sinful corrupt natures, living a godly, righteous and lober
life, denying all ungodliness and worldly lusts, walking before God in
uprightness of heart, striving against all the vanities of this sinful life,
and leading our lives answerable to the rule of Gods most holy word.

III. Mark is, if we have a moderate 3 Mark 1 Cor. 7. 2^ etc.
use of these earthly things, observing a mediocritie both in worldly cares and
earthly delights, in using this world, as not abusing it: for the fashion of
this world passes away.

IV. Mark is, if we have our conversation 4 Mark 1 Timothy 6. 19
in heaven, laying up in store a good foundation against the time to come: even
treasure in heaven, setting our affections Mat. 6-20. Col. 3. 1. 2. 3 Tit. 2.
^3.
on things above, and not on the things on the earth, looking for the glorious
appearing of our Savior Jesus Christ.

Thirdly, the Motives. Oh but what be Motives to make us ready for Christ
speedily, sundry 1 Motive
the motives to induce us to long earnestly for the coming of our Savior
Jesus Christ.

I. Motive is, the shortness and breuity of our lives: for our life is
compared to the Grass that withers, to a shadow that Esaias 40. 6 1 Pet. 1. 24
Hos. 23. 3. Job 7. 6. and 14. 2. and 7. 9. Iam 4 14. Job 7. 7. Psa. 103. 16 and
144. 4. Psalm. 102. 11
passes away, to smoke that vanishes, to a weauers shuttle for swiftness,
to a flower that sadeth, to a Spiders web which is easily swept away, to a
vpour which is soon dispersed and to a wind that passes away.

Oh let us seriously consider with our selves, that we may be the next parties
that must dye. Seeing then we may be so suddenly dispatched by death, Oh what
manner of persons ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness. 2
Pet. 3. 11 2 Motive


II. Motive. By being ready for Christ at his coming, we shall be delivered
from all the miseries of this life, viz. from all calamities, as sickness,
pains, labors, reproachings, mockings and taunts of the wicked rabble of
unreasonable men, and 2 These. 3. 2. 1 These. 1. 10 Esaias 25. 8. Apoc. 7. 16 17.
Apo. 14. 13 Apoc. 21. 4. 3 Motive John 14. 3. 1 John 3. 2. Luke 23. 42. 43.
from all the prouocations, snares, stratagenis of the Devil, and from all
fear of the pains of hell for ever

III. Motive, by being ready prepared for Christ's coming, we shall be with
Christ where he is, viz. in the Kingdom of heaven, where we shall see him as
he is, where we shall bless the day and hour that ever we were borne: for
happy and for ever thrice blessed are they, that after this short and fleeting
life ended, shall enter into heavens glory.

This glory of Gods people in heaven will appear more punctually to us, if we
take a survey of these things, that here upon result. To let pass many, of
some few for the rest, a word or two briefly.

2. God will be all in all unto his children in the Kingdom of heaven: for
what good things soever the heart of man can with or desire, that God will be
to his children there: if we desire wealth, God will be wealth unto us: if
honor and pleasure, he will be honor and pleasure to us, yea all in all 1 Cor.
15. 28. Luke ^^. 32. Ioh. 14. 2. 3 1 Pet. 1. 4-^
unto us: nay every child of God shall have a kingdom reserved for them in
heaven.

2. In heaven we shall want nothing: for we shall have all our wants both in
our souls and bodies wholly supplied, when Apoc. 7. 17 Esa. 49. 10. Apoc. 21.
4. Esaias 25. 8. Apoc. 22. 4. Psalm. 23. 4. 1 Cor. 13. 12. 1 John. 3. 2. Psalm. 16.
11. 1 These. 4. 17 Psalm. 36. 8. 9 and 17. 15. Phil. 3. 21. Esaias 64. 4. Apoc. 7.
9. 10. 1^ 12. 4 Motive Mat. 10. 28.
al tears shall be wiped from our eyes, with fulness of joys and pleasures for
ever. Although in this vale of misery and shadow of death, we see God but in
pact* yet in heaven we shall behold him face to face, and see him as he is to
our everlasting comfort.

3. In heaven we shall be like our Lord Jesus Christ, for he shall change our
vile bodies, and make them like unto his glorious body.

4. In heaven we shall reap endless ioies and happiness, where we shall wholly
delight our selves in praising God for ever.

IV And last Motive is drawn from the inevitable danger that shall must
certainly overtake us* if we prepare not our selves speedily to be ready for
Christ.

If we be in some great man's danger, that is able to be revenged of us, Oh how
do we creep and crouch unto him: but we should fear him much more that is
able to Mat. 3. 12.
destroy both soul and body in hell. And if we had hearts to conceive, and
grace to believe, and minds to think upon the woeful pains of hell, this would
force us to forsake and renounce all sin utterly, and make us prepare for
Christ speedily, that so we may enter heavens glory immediately. ^ut alas,
alas, the power and strength of sin nowadaies has gotten such dominion over
the most, that it has banished and excluded all love and fear of God, and al
dread of hels misery out of their hearts* what else mean those raging and ruling
vices in the world, as swearing, lying, uncleanness, drunkenness, mocking of
Gods servants, and such like: if people did seriously call to mind the
grievous pains of hell, would they live as they do? No I trow.

There are some be so tender, that they cannot abide the heat of the Sun, nor
the least cold, yea every small flea or fly disquiets them, but their many
foul iniquities never trouble them, to bring them any vnerst, unless it be to
bring their hellish designs to pass. Oh that such would consider what it is
to fry in unquenchable Apoc. 21. 3
flames of fire and brimstone in hell. and there to have the never dying worm
of Conscience to gnaw on them continually. Mark 9. 43


There are a sort of nice ones that are so dainty they cannot abide to look
upon the sores of poor Lazarus and so unmerciful, that they stop their ears
at the cry of their poor distressed brethron, seeking rather to molest them,
then to comfort and help the^. Oh that such miserable caitifes would remember
what a filthy prison is prepared for the damned in hell, and what yelling and
howling the merciless shall ever hear, and have even judgment without mercy.

There are a sort of miserable wretches, to whom the sernice of God (though
indeed perfect freedom) is most irksome, as to kneel at prayer, to be any
thing long at a sermon, or the like exercises: but to swear, to ly, to cheat,
to cozen in buying and selling, to be drunk, and hunt after vain and wicked
pleasures, is their chief delight and joy.

Oh that all miserable wretched swearers, Rorers, and pot companions, would but
premeditate of the woeful pains of hell, that they might repent of their
sins, and so avoid Hels misery speedily, and be prepared for Christ
continually, that they may enter heavens glory eternally.

And there are another sort that are like the wicked Pharisees, of whom our
Savior Mat. 23. 13. Luke 11. 52.
speaks, that will neither go to heaven themselves, nor yet will suffer by
their wills, those that would: else what mean all those accursed scoffs,
mockes and taunts which the wicked crew blech out of their accursed breasts
against all those that set their hearts and faces toward Sion, the heavenly
Jerusalem, in traducing, carping, and girding at them, because they will not
run headlong to the Devil with 1 Pet 4. 4. John 8. 34. Romans 6. 16. 20. 1 Ioh.
3. 8. 10. 2 Pe. 2* ^9. 2 Timothy 2. 26. Act. 13. 10. Mat. 23. 33 Act. 8 22. Phil.
3. 19. Luke 13. 35 Luke 12. 40 Mat. 24. 13. Mar. 13. 33. Mat. 24. 42
them for company, into the same excess of riot, therefore they speak evil
of them.

Oh miserable servants of sin, slaves of the Devil, taken captive at his
will and pleasure, how long will ye pervert the ways of God? miserable
wretches, how can ye escape the damnation of hell? Oh repent of this your great
wickedness, and pray God that the thoughts of your hearts may be forgiven you:
for without true repentance your end will be destruction and damnation. It may
be this night Death for ought you know may dispatch you suddenly, before you be
prepared for Christ: and then woeful and miserable will your estate be: it had
been good for you, that Mat. 26. 24
ye had never been borne. Oh that all the rabblement of the wicked crew, would
seriously think of hell, and be forewarned now whilst it is called to day,
and that Heb. 3 15. Lu^. 1^. 28 verse. 26.
with all expedition, lest they come into the place of hels torments, from
whence is no redemption. This would be a strong motive unto them, if they had
but any dram of true grace in their hearts, it would bridle and curb their
lewd affections, and dry up the fountain of their filthy words, change the
vain course of their conversation, and make them willing to submit themselves
to any good course whatsoever, so that they may avoid the bitter torments of
hell.

If a man have but some extremity of Simile.
the Gout, Collicke or Tooth ache, what pains and cost will he be at to be
eased? Oh what are these to the endless, easelesse, remediless pains of
hell? yet few there are that will bestow the cost and pains to avoid them. Oh
that all the revel rout of beastly drunkards, and all other impenitent
persons, would but meditate seriously a little upon Dives in Hell, how that for
one drop of water to cool his tongue, he cries most bitterly in the gulf of
hell for the obtaining of it, and yet goes without it. Oh that all this that
has Luke 25 26.
been said, would cause every miserable wretch in the world, that hears or
reads of the most woeful torments of hell, with all prayers and tears of true
repentance, to work out their salvation in the fear 2 Cor. 7. 1.
of God.

Hear what St. Chrysostom speaks Chrisost. in 2 Epist. ad Corin. hom. 10
to this purpose, If thou, says he, should come into a loathsome prison and
there see some look pale and wan, others hungry and thirsty, others bound in
chains and fetters, others shut up in a dark and filthy dungeon, making
pittious moan and lamentation, would it not move thy heart with commiseration,
and cause thee carefully to avoid those courses that might bring thee to the
like danger: oh the^ think upon the prison and dungeon of hell, and confider
seriously with your selves, oh miserable wretches, how many poor souls look
pitifully there, how many are bound strongly there in the devils fetters, how
many are shut up in the place of utter darkness, and being in, continually
tormented with foul and ugly devils in hell, do nothing but weep and wail
and gnash their teeth for evermore in extremity of pain: oh what madness is
this in every one of us all, if in this our pilgrimage or travel on the earth
we spend our days in pleasu^es, bathe our selves in sports and pastimes,
ca^king and caring for the things of this life, and never bethink our selves as
to say ^las (...) do I now, eat, drink, mock, swear, cozen, cheat, whore,
and bathe my self in all kind of lewd courses, but woe is me for (...) must
come to judgment for all these things, to give a strict account of all those
things that I have done in my vile body, whether it be good or evil, Eccles.
11. 9. 2 Cor. 5. 10. Eccles. 12. 14. Mat. 12. to close up this, Luke 12. 40.
Be therefore ready for the Son of man comes also at an hour when ye
think not.

III Use. Apoc. 14. 13. Blessed are the 3 Use.
dead that die in the Lord, etc. Not to stay long on this, let these things
that are here inbalmed be had in remembrance briefly: 1 They are blessed in
respect of the place, for if we consider the world wherein we live, it is but a
prison, a vale of misery, a place of vexation and trouble, as the blessed
Apostle testifies in Romans 8. 22. but heaven is a place of joy, rest and
comfort, John 14. 16. The world is of no certain continuance, here we have no
abiding City, but we look for one to come, Heb. 13. 14. but in heaven is a
place of continuance, for the foundation is God, Heb. 11. 10 2 They are blessed
in regard of their companions, for here we live among wicked, godless, sinful
wretches, but there we shall enjoy the company of innumerable Saints in
heaven. It was an excellent Dan. 7 9. Heb. 12. 22. Apoc. 5. 11 Heb. 12. 11.
Apoc. 7. 19, 10, 11. 12. ^ Sam 9. 3. to 27. and 10. 1. 1 Samuel 16. 11, 12. 13 2 Samuel 7. 8. Apoc. 22. 5. Apoc. 21. 4. Mat. 6. 20.
exchange for Saul when he was seeking his fathers Asses to be called to be a
King: so it was an excellent exchange for David when he was called from a
shepherd to be a King. Oh, yet this is nothing to their estate which are
called from this miserable world to heaven, where there is light without
darkness, joy without sorrow, riches without corruption, and all without
ending: yea wisdom without ignorance, understanding without error, reason
without obscurity, memory without oblivion, where whatsoever shall be desired
shall be obtained, where we shall see God face to face, 1 Cor. 31. 12. even as
he is, 1 Ioh. 3. 2. to our everlasting comfort world without end. 3 They are
blessed because III.
of their condition, for they rest from all their labors: for they that die in
the APoc. 14. 10. 1 These. 4. 18. Phil. 1. 23. Phil. 1. 22.
Lord are for the Lord. This made Saint Paul desire to be dissolved and to be
with Christ: death considered in Christ and joined with a godly life, to Gods
Elect is an advantage: death to the godly is nothing else but a bridge over
this tempestuous sea of this troublesome world to paradise, Gods mercy made it
not by making death in it self good but an instrument of good to his. Oh why
shall we then be unwilling to dye, for death does not separate us from God,
but it makes us draw near to God, as Pharaohs Butler could not see the face
Genesis 40. 21
of the King when as he was in prison, 1 Cor. 13.
but being loosed from his bonds, he both saw him, and gave the cup into his
hand. So long as our souls be in the prison of our bodies we cannot see the
face of God, Esaias 64. 4 1 Cor 2. 9. 1 Cor. 1^. ^6.
but our souls being once loosed from our bodies we shall see God face to face,
and enjoy that unspeakable good which God has prepared for all them that love
him: do thou fear God sincerely, oh then fear not death for the sting of
death; is taken away from thee by Christ. If one enemy find favor at another
enemies hand, oh why then should a dutiful child fear to go home to his
heavenly father, and a penitent sinner to go to his sweet Savior: if Christ
came into this world to redeem us, oh why should we doubt but at our death he
will receive us, he that bought us at so dear a rate even with his own blood,
which is most precious, will Act. 20. 28. 1 Pet. 1. 18.
he refuse his penny worth? if he affected our company so much on earth, as
that he said, my delight is to be with the children of men, Pro 8. 23. Has he
now so forgotten his old love as not to admit us into his company in heaven,
seeing he went thither to prepare a place for us? oh let us Ioh. 14. 22.
then surrender our souls and bodies up unto God as a faithful Creator. 1
Pet. 4. 19. To conclude Apoc. 14. 13. Blessed are the dead that dye in the Lord.

FINIS.
