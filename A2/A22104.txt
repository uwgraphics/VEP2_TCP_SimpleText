A Proclamation commanding the repair of Noblemen and Gentlemen into their
several Countries, at the end of the Term.
IT is Our Princely Office and care to provide that all parts, Estats and
Degrees of our People be sustained and cherished, and that they may receive
mutual comfort the one by the other, especially where the need is most: And
that the ancient and lawdable customs of this Our Realm be continued and
observed, and new inconveniences (which the times do daily breed) repressed
and prevented; Whereas therefore We are given to understand, That there is a
great repair and confluence, as well to the Cities of London and Westminster,
and the Suburbs of them, as to other Cities within Our Kingdom, of Noblemen
and Gentlemen, who are Our principal Ministers for the government of the
several Counties of Our Kingdom, in respert of Our Commissions of
Lieutenancie and the Peace: And that their coming is with purpose to live and
abide in the said Cities and places with their families for this whole Winter,
or at least during the Christmas time; whereby the government of the Countries
will be weakened, Hospitality and the relief of the poor (especially at such
a time) decayed, and the said Cities, and places surcharged and pestered, and
the prices of Victuals there, and all other provisions and things excessiuely
raised and inhaunsed: We do by these presents will and command, as well all
Our Lieutenants and Noblemen (except such as be of Our Privy Council, or
bear any Office about the Person, or Court of Our selves, or Our dear and
well-beloved Consort the Queen,) and likewise all Deputy Lieutenants, and
Justices of Peace; That they and every of them do immediately upon the end of
this present Term, being the Nine and twentieth day of November, from the said
Cities and places, repair unto their several Countries to attend their
service there, and to keep House and Hospitality, as appertains to their
place and degree, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such punishment as is
due for the contempt of Our Royal commandment.

Given at Royston the 24. day of October, in the twelfth year of Our Reign of
England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the eight and fourtieth.

Majesty ANNO DOM. 1614.
