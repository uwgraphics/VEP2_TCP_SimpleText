To all that desire to be instructed in the Truth which is according to
Godliness.
IT is not scarcity of Catechismes that has brought this Tract to light; nor
yet the novelty either of the matter, or expressions therein contained. Both
these, for the most part, you may happily meet with elsewhere, scattered in
Treatises of like nature. That which commends it unto your purusall, is the
brevity and perspicuity of it. Both these I have purposely affected, having
therein a special regard to the capacities and memories of Children, whether
in age or knowledge. For their sakes, proceeding in a methodicall way, I have
contracted both Questions and Answers, into as few words as conveniently I
could, that so both might be the more portable. Hereof, who so shall please to
make use, committing these few leaves to head and heart, comparing the Proofs
with the Text, I doubt not but in a short time (through the blessing of God) he
may come to be a good proficient in that most excellent and necessary
knowledge, the knowledge of God and Jesus Christ; which unfainedly wishing to
all, specially to those of my own charge, for whose sake at the first this
Manual was composed, I rest,

Yours and the Churches JOHN BRINSLEY.
