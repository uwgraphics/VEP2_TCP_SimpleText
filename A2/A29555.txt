THE LORD GEORGE DIGBIES APOLOGY FOR HIMSELF, Published the fourth of
January, Anno Dom. 1642.

Printed at Oxford, M. DC. XLII.

The Lord George Digbies Apology for himself, published the fourth of
January, Anno Dom. 1642,
IT may be wondered at, that, after well nigh a years groaning under the most
insupportable burden of public displeasure, and censure 'I should now
consider my self so much, as, in a general calamity, to make an Apology to
the world; or should hope, that at a time when so great clouds of jealousy,
and disesteeme hang over persons of the most clear, and unblemished
reputations, any thing I can say may reconcile me to those affections* which
have been transported with so much violence to my prejudice. But whosoever
knows me well, and the great trouble of mind I endured when I found my self
(by what demerit, God is my judge, I cannot guess) fallen from that proportion
of esteem with my Country (of which I was prouder then I can be of any
worldly preferment) into so eminent a degree of disfavour with the
representative body thereof (upon whose wisdom and Authority no man has
looked with more reverence, and veneration) that I was marked out as an enemy
to the Commonwealth, I am sure cannot but expect from me some discovery of that
sense, and that I should, at least endeavor to distinguish my misfortunes from
my faults, whereby such, who are not engaged in a peremptory uncharitableness,
may find cause to change the Opinion they have taken upon trust of me.

Nor am I out of hope, that the experience men have since had of the times
inclination to calumny, by the declining of so many persons of Honor, and
integrity in the popular estimation, may at the last, open a way to so much
justice and ingenuity on my behalf, that all men may discern in their own
right, that if they shall so credulously consent, upon general discourses, to
sacrifice a third man's honor, and reputation, they shall open a door to let
in ruin to themselves, and may quickly loose the advantage of their own
innocence.

I shall begin my unfortunate story from the beginning of this Parliament;
reflecting no further back upon the precedent, then in a remembrance of the
great comfort I then received in my Countries acceptance of my first attempts
in its service, at a time, as some were pleased to express it, when the Court
was at the highest, whether to work upon men's, ambitions, or fears. Before
that time I am sure I was as unacquainted with Action, as with Envy, having
kept more company with books, then with men; and being so well content with
that society, that I had as little ambition, as merit to improve my condition.
To this Parliament I was sent on the behalf of the Country wherein I lived,
and truly, if I brought any passion or affection thither with me, it was my
former warmth improved against those pressures, and the persons who begot those
pressures, which were grievous to the people: and against these I will without
vanity say, that I brought as great a resolution to discharge my conscience,
and my duty, as any man in that Assembly, and had the happiness for some
months, to receive that testimony. My conversation was, and I made or
endeavored to make my friendships, with those, whose experience, and
abilities, were most eminent for the public service, and to the reputation,
and authority of these men, I confess, for a while, I gave my self up with as
much submission, as a man could, without resigning the use of his own
understanding. In any thing that was necessary, or but probably pretended to be
necessary for the Commonwealth, we never differed in the least degree; but in
improvements, in real alterations, which were to be governed by prudentiall
motives, we were not always of one mind. And whosoever remembers the
passages of that time, must call to mind, that the first declination I suffered
from the interest I seemed to have, was in the business of the Church: in
which, having had frequent consultations with the chiefest agents for a
reformation, and finding no three men to agree upon what they would have in the
place of that they all resolved to remove, I agreed not with the prevailing
sense, having not hardiness enough to incline to a mutation, which would
evidently have so great an influence upon the peace, prosperity, and interest
of the whole Kingdom. And thus, from the first debate of Episcopacy, upon the
London Petition, all men observed the date of my unmerited favor began to
expire. Then came on the trial of the Earl of Sirafford, in the which I must
say, I failed not of my duty in proving the charge and evidence, before those
who were to judge of both. In the discharging of that duty, it was my fortune,
by the unluckie acception of some expressions of mine, to draw upon me a sharp
malignity from some persons of much interest in the House, which never failed
to manifest it self, after that accident, upon every the least occasion.

About this time, I was told by a Friend, that I lost much of my credit by
being observed to be so much at Court; I replied, that I had not then the same
justice with other men, who were there more then I, though they avowed it
less; that it was a principal joy to me, to see those persons, who had been
the prime Actours in the happy Reformation of this Parliament, so acceptable at
Court, and likely to have so great a share in the chief places there, and the
conduct of affairs for the future. That since it had pleased His Majesty to
give so plenary a Redress to all the grievances of His Subjects, and to secure
them for ever from the like invasions, by such a wall of brass as the
Trienniall Bill, I conceived that thence forward, there was no more to be
thought on, but how in a grateful return to His Majesty, to advance His
Honor, and Plenty, according as before such happy settlements, I had often
heard those principal intendents of the public good most solemnly profess,
and consequently, that the Court, and Country were, in truth, now to be all of
a piece, and there would hereafter be no more cause of jealousy between them:
Lastly, that, howsoever, I thought my self as likely to do good there, as to
receive hurt.

The first evidence I had of the disfavour of the House of Commons, (where I
had served with all faithfulness, diligence, and humility,) was upon the
printing of my Speech to the Bill of Attainder of the Earl of Strafford. As for
the Good-Fridayes exercise which the delivery of it in the House procured me,
I reputed that a most comfortable and eminent testimony of the continuance
still of much justice and favor toward me in that Honorable House; since,
after a dozen distinct charges upon the several passages of that Speech, urged
against me with great strictness and acrimony, by that number of the most
eminent persons there, both in abilities and interests, and at a time when
certainly most men of my opinion were at their Devotions, they were not able
after four hours debate to expose me, either upon the mayn matter, or upon
the bye, unto the least reprehension.

For the thing it self, I will say no more of it, but that it happened to be
upon a very unpopular argument; but the cause and circumstance of the printing
it, was this:

I did not find only that it was unfaithfully reported, and uncharitably
interpreted, but was informed, that Copies went abroad of it so falsely, and
maliciously collected, as made the whole Speech a justification of my Lord of
Staffords innocence; and Sir Lewis Dives having heard of such a Copy in the
house of a Citizen of good quality, where he heard me mentioned as a person
fit to have his name fixed upon posts, that I might be torn in pieces by the
people; upon that Reason earnestly desired me to give him a true Copy of what
I had said in that Argument, which I did, and he forthwith gave direction for
the Printing it, without any privity of mine. Yet, if I had consented to it,
and directed it, I profess, I should little have imagined, that (at a time
when there was such an universal license taken to Print every thing, of how
great irreverence soever,) either to Church or State, with impunity, a Speech
made in the House of Commons, a Speech so narrowly, and severely sifted, and
examined there, and yet let pass without the least censure, either on the
Speech it self, or the Author; that the Printing of such a Speech should rise
to so high a nature, as to make me for ever incapable of any Honor or
Employment in the Commonwealth; I profess could hardly have fallen within my
Reason or fears to suspect. And yet 3 months after the fact committed, after
the Printing of an 100 Speeches more by other men, after my having several
times sued, and pressed for a hearing, whilst I was of the House of Commons;
after by His Majesty's favor I had sat six or seven weeks a Member of the
House of Peers, after all this, no less a judgment (as far as the Vote of the
House of Commons could contribute to it) passed upon me unheard, over, and
above the shame of having the Speech it self burned by the hand of the Hangman.
How I bore this affliction, with what anxiety of mind to my self, with what
temper and submission to that Honorable Assembly, from whence the blow came,
as many of my near friends can testify the first; so the envy, or malice of no
man, can reasonably and justly tax me, as unto the other. How other young men:
upon no greater a stock of innocence then mine, might have suffered themselves
to be transported upon such misfortunes, (not to give them any other term) I
leave to those to judge, who have not been so long brought up in the Schole of
affliction.

As this censure fell upon me for many Months after the fault objected, so it
rested within those walls where it begun without ever desiring a concurrence
from that Court, where I was only to be judged, and where I could only answer
for my self, and hope for a vindication; which increased my sufferings to an
unspeakble height, that I could by no means clear my self in the place where
I received the wound, nor could take notice of it, where I might be cleared by
my Peers, for fere of breach of privilege of Parliament; Though my censure
were known to all the Kingdom, yea, I may say my infamy in print with
foreign Nations.

Under this weight (enough to have broken a body, and a mind better prepared
for these exercises then mine) I suffered till the rudeness and violence of
that Rabble, drove both their Majesty's, for the safety of themselves and their
children, to Hampton Court, whither by command I attended them. In this short
journey many Soldiers, and Commanders (who had assembled themselves, jointly
to solicit the payment of their arreares for the late Northern expedition,
from the two Houses of Parliament) waited on their Majesty's, and leaving them
at Hampton Court, provided their own accommodations at Kingston, the next
place of receipt, and still so used for the overplus of company, which the
Court it self could not entertain. To these Gentlemen, of whom few or none
were of my acquaintance; and to this place was I sent by his Majesty, with some
expressions of his Majesty's good acceptance of their service, and returning
the same night to Hampton Court, continued my attendance to Windsor, whither
their Majesty's then repaired. I had not been there one day, when I heard that
both Houses of Parliament were informed, that I, and Colonel Lunsford, a person
with whom I never exchanged twenty words in my life, had appeared in a warlike
manner at Kingston, to the terror of the Kings liege people; and thereupon had
ordered, that the Sheriff of Surrey, and as I conceive, that all other
Sheriffs throughout England should raise the power of their several Counties,
to suppress the forces that he and I had levied.

When first this news was brought me, I could not but slight it; as a
ridiculous rumor; for being most certain, that I had never been at Kingston
but only upon that message of the Kings to forty or fifty Gentlemen, totally
strangers to me, with whom I stayed not the space of half an hour, at most,
and in no other equipage, then a Coach and six hired horses, with one single
man in the Coach with me, and one servant riding by: I thought it utterly
impossible for the most Remancy it self, at so near a distance, to raise out
of that any serious matter of scandal, or prejudice upon me. But when soon
after, I received from some of my friends, not only a confirmation of that
seeming impossibility, but a particular account of the manner of it: How some
information concerning me at Kingston had been referred to the examination of a
Committee of my sharpest enemies; how the six Coach-horses I appeared with
there, were turned by them into six score horses; and that mistake, I know not
by what prevalence of my unhappiness, or of my enemies credit, not suffered to
be rectified by other witnesses there, who affirmed the truth: Finding my self
in this sad condition, but twenty miles off, and not knowing how the people in
other places might be terrified, if reports concerning me should spread, but in
a proportionable rate, to remoter distances, they being now derivable from such
considerable Authors, I must confess I then began to look upon my self as a
person of that rare misfortune, that my reputation would not weigh down the
most improbable, or impossible accusation, but fit to receive any imputation of
guilt, the most mischievous or malicious instrument of calumny could invent.
And in this condition, with no other discontent, then not believing my self
much indebted to the world for good usage, I procured his Majesty's license, to
transport a person of so great inconvenience and danger, out of his Dominions
into another Country; and with all possible speed removed my self into
Holland, never suspecting that my guilt would increase with my absence, in the
retired private life which I had resolved on, and did according to that
resolution, l^ad beyond sea; having the vanity of some hope, that a little time
discovering the falsehood of some things believed of me, would take away the
inconvenience of other things that were but unworthily suspected. Some weeks I
rested there without any new hurt, till the falsehood of a person, to whose
trust I committed a Packed, brought it to a hand well contented with any
occasion to satisfy his own particular private malice, and revenge upon me;
and so my Letters, one to the Queens Majesty, and the other to my Brother, Sir
Lewis Dives, were publicly brought to be read; in both Houses of Parliament;
from thence new arguments of guilt are so far enforced against me, and the
former displeasure revived and heightened to such a pitch, that at the same time
I heard of the interception of my Letters, I found my self accused of High
Treason too, and that for levying war against the King, a crime certainly
that of all other, I could least suspect my self guilty of. And to say the
truth, it came into my charge but by accident; for being in general charged of
High Treason, and the impeachment in particular, bearing only that I had
appeared in warlike manner to the terror of the Kings Subjects, a question was
raised by a Lord or two, learned in the law, whether that accusation would
amount to treason, or no, and so leave was desired to amend the charge, which
being granted to make sure work, by the Statute of 25 Ed. 3. it was put in,
that I had leavied war against the King. If I were guilty, or suspected of so
loud a crime, how it came to sleep so long, or if not, how these Letters
(wherein upon an unpartiall survey there will not be found so much as an
opinion as unto peace or war) could minister occasion for a charge of my
leyying war against the King, I leave to equal consideration. I am far from
censuring or disputing the resolution, or opinion of both, or either House of
Parliament; no man receives a stroke from thence with more submission and
humility, and the great reverence I bear to it has made such an impression in
me, that the weight of their displeasure has added many years to me, but in
so near a concernment of my life, and my honor, that grave assembly may give
me leave, without presuming to think their judgments unjust, to say, their
evidence may be untrue, and the persons trusted by them, not so full of honor,
ingenuity, or integrity, so free from passion, malice, interest, or affection,
as they are thought. It will be no presumption, or disrespect to that great
Counsel to say, that I have many enemies, who who have used all the ill arts;
their wit or malice could suggest, to bring this affliction upon me, and have
not in whispers, or in the dark published their resolution to destroy me:
witness the known tampering with very many persons, both by threats, and
promises, to accuse me; their creating and cherishing such monstrous untruths
of my treating with the Danes, and other foreign power of a great treason of
mine plotted, and discovered at Sherburne, with mighty warlike preparations
there: of my being at the head of the Rebels in Ireland, and the like; to make
me odious to the people, to whose rage and violence they have often endeavored
to give me up a sacrifice; the deep sense I have of my afflictions, and
injuries, shall never transport me to heighten the representation of them to
the least degree beyond truth; but whoever shall consider the penalty of
Treason, the ruin and desolation it brings to families, the brand and infamy
it fixes on our memories, and shall remember that this portion was designed to
me, for going on my masters errant, in a Coach and six horses, will believe
that a mixture of sorrow and innocence, with so much passion as may keep them
company, may well be allowed to breath it self with so much freedom, as to
present to the world with a true and sensible life my sufferings, upon
whomsoever the injustice and inhumanitie may light, of having oppressed and bowed
down to the earth, a young man and all his hopes, by such undeserved
calamities.

Since that time, other letters of mine or copies of letters (possibly never
sent) have had the same fortune, and been published to the world, to show the
follies and indiscretions of a man, enough in her disfavour before, with
Glosses and Comments to inform the people how much of the dangerous and
pernicious Counsels, pretended to be then, and still on foot, had passed
through my hands, and how great an enemy I am to Parliaments, to this later
most grievous and venomous imputation, I hope God will have preserved me some
kind of Antidote in men's memories, of what part J had the happiness to bear
in the passing of the Trienniall Bill, and to it J shall only say thus much,
that I have had the honor to be a member of the one House, and must presume to
think my self still a member of the other, that J value the honor, the
dignity and the privileges of both, infinitely above the pleasures and
benefits of life, and if J ever wilfully contributed, or shall ever consent to
the prejudice of either, I wish the desires of all my enemies may fall upon me.

To that of my having had so great a hand in ill Counsels, which are expressed
to be of His Majesty's removing from LONDON to a place of safety, and the like,
I shall be bold to say, that the Letter to the Queens Majesty, from whence my
enemies would make the inference, has not with any considerer the least
propending of advice any way, but is merely an account of mine own intentions
to apply my self to His Majesty's service, either by absence, or attendance,
according to course, that His Majesty in His wisdom should think fit to take.
Every body knows I never had the honor to be a Counselor, neither have I
presumed, without being questioned by His Majesty, to interpose in His
affairs: when he has graced me with any question, I have answered with the
freedom of a Subject, and a Gentleman. But had I bin a Counselor, having seen
what I have seen, and heard what I heard, I, who have known such members of
both Houses, marked out by the multitude for blessings, and such for sacrifice:
I who can say with truth, that such of that rabble, cried out, the King's the
Traitor; such, that the young Prince would govern better; I who can prove
that a Leader of those people in the heat and violence of the tumult, cried
out, that the King was not fit to live; Had I been a Counselor, what had I
been (as the learning of Treason was then understood) should I not have
advised. His Majesty to withdraw to a place of safety, not from His Parliament,
but from that insolent and unruly multitude, who had already brought in^o so
much hazard the persons and the liberty of this till then most happy
Parliament, and not staying there, did so lowdly threaten ruin, even to the
sacred Person of the King; Advertise his Majesty I did of the danger; advise
him I could not, J had neither the ability, nor the authority.

In my letter to the Queen, at her first coming into Holland, it was
observed, that in that expression, [of welcoming her from a Country not worthy
of her.] I showed much venime and rancour to my own Nation. I meant it not, and
must appeal to those who are best acquainted with the Civility of language,
whether the address might not be comely to any Lady of quality, who should
upon any not pleasing occasion, leave one Country for a while to reside in
another. And J hope e're long to welcome her majesty back from a place not so
unworthy of her, unto this Nation most worthy of her, without either
disparagement to Holland, or complement to those to who^ the unworthy of that
letter was intended.

For the charge of boldness, and presumption in some expressions of those
letters (though J might be glad to compound my treason for incivilitie) since
the suspicion of that depends upon the right understanding of language, and
connection of words; it will be no disrespect to any, through whose hands they
have passed, to believe, that as they were otherwise intended by me, so that
they are capable of other interpretation. However, if in truth,
misunderstanding, or ill breeding has produced the other, J hope the
conclusion will only be, that I am an ill Courtier, or an ill Secretary, both
which I do humbly confess, not that I am no good English man, no good subject.
If in any of those letters there were any expressions of discontent or
bitterness, I shall say little more, then that they passed an examination they
were not prepared for, and fell into hands that they were not directed to: and
I am confident that many honest Gentlemen, who have had the happiness to
preserve their papers from such an inquisition, and shall consider the case
they might be in, if all their secret conferences, and private letters were
exposed and produced to the public view, will cast up these letters of mine,
in the number of my misfortunes, without making any addition to my faults: and
certainly, whoever shall observe the measure of my sufferings, with any kind of
indifference, will easily forgive such eruptions of passion, as were only
vented by me to a brother, though they came within the reach of any other care.

To draw now to a Period of my unfortunate story, which I cannot promise my
self, from the generality, so much charity as to vouchsafe the reading,
further then mere curiosity shall lead them; I returned into England not with
so much joy to see my Country, as hope to be admitted upon my humble Petition
to His majesty, to a fair, regular, impartial vindication of my innocence,
and J protest to God, I look upon the time I may naturally hope to live with
no other comfort, then as it may make me still capable of that happiness. I
have follies and infirmities enough about me to make me ask the pardon of
every wise and good man, but for treason (or for any voluntary crime (either
against my Sovereign, or my country) I say it with all humility, I will not
accept a pardon from the King and Parliament. By the grace of God it shall
never be said, that either the Parliament has brought me, or His majesty
exposed me to atriall, my own uprightness shall constantly solicit it, and
without recourse in this to either of their favors, I will either stand a
justified man to the world, or fall an innocent. But in the mean time, till it
please God to bless this nation with such a composure of the present
distractions, as that Government and Law may have their rightful and
comfortable course, J implore only so much charity from men, as may seem due to
one, whose good intentions to his country have bin in some sort publicly
manifested, whose ill are yet but obscurely and improbably suggested.

To conclude, let the few (...) have lived be examined, and if there be found
any rancour or venime in my nature, even toward particular persons which might
in time contract it self to an enmity against the state; if I have bin a
fomenter of jealousies and debate, or a secret conspirer against the honor and
fame of any man; If I have worn Religion as a mask and vizard for my
hypocrisy, and underhand cherished any opinions that I have not a vowed; if I
have bin lead by any hopes of preferment to flattery, or by the miss of it, to
revenge, if I have been transported with private ambition and been inclined to
sacrifice the least branch of the public peace and happiness to my own ends
and advantage, let the complication of all these ills prepare a judgment of
treason it self upon me, and let me be looked upon as a man who has made a
progress in wickedness, that a few years more added to that account, would
render me a prodigy to the world, But if in truth my life has been pleasant
to me under no other nation, then as I might make it useful to my Country, and
have made it my business to beget and continue a good intelligence amongst
good men; If I have bin then most zealous and fervent for the liberties of the
Subject, when the power of Court was most prevalent, and for the rights of the
Crown, when popular license was most predominant; if by my Continual study
and practice of Religion, I have always bin a true son of the Church of
England, and by my submission and application of my actious to the known rule
of the Law, I have always bin a true son of the state of England; if my
actions have bin honest and my words only doubtful; if my life only clouded
with many imperfections, I hope the world will believe, I have been overtaken
with too great a measure of unhappiness, and every generous heart will ease me
of some part of my burden, by giving the benefit of his good opinion.

FINIS.
