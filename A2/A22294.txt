TO THE READER.
THe means have been very manifold in all ages (most loving Reader) which
Aucthorie by reason has established in the variable, yet orderly governments
of States and people for the holdinge them in that most loving and memberlike
duty which one part owes unto others, and every of them to the conservation
of the whole body in best estate. Among which, this has had his special
place: that in the common and still continuing, commerce and interchangeable
traffic, passing between man and man, Country and Country, each has been
limited to others reasonable liking, by a due observation of such assise in the
matter of true weight and measure, as by general consent has been commended
to particular practice. Now albeit, that reason it self may in this behalf,
seem a sufficient school mistress to every man not degenerate. Yet when for
the needful use of this equity, the Aucthor both of reason and holy
religion, shall commend and command it to be carefully kept of all such as
profess themselves to be his people (and that under the penalty of most
fearful execrations, to the violaters of the same) how ought every Christian
to be carried with a conscience of duty herein: upon which no doubt, the
most lawful and wholesome constitutions of this my native country of England
were first founded, and still do stand built. And therefore presents unto
every true natural and loyal subject of the same (even as he owes obedience
to his most dread sovereign, not so much for fear as conscience sake) a
plain path truly tending to this kind of justice, which many always seeking
to themselves, does sildome practice toward others, for the avoiding of whose
common, though oftentimes most untrue excuse herein (in alleging their
ignorance of the laws, to be the lack of their lawful obedience) I have drawn
together such Acts, Statutes, and ordinances, as having been ordained and used
in sundry Kings Reigns, and now allowed by the Honorable in authority: most
apt and proper for the warranting of all lawful Assise both in weight and
measure, which are to be used at this day, and within this Realm: especially
such as concern the Bakers, Brewers, and Inholders directions. The not
observing whereof upon so manifest and plain a publishing, what shall it else but
note unto us the men of worst mark, whether we respect their conscience
toward God, or their verteous conversation in a Christian common wealth. And
if all laws established by lawful authority (not repugning the laws of God)
are to be embraced by Christian subjects in a conscionable obedience: by what
excuse then do they think to wind out from the desert of such disobedience as
directly contrarieth both Gods and man's laws at once: of which nature these
are, that command the true observation of weight and measure between man and
man. In the book of Leuiticus thus we read. You shall not do unjustly, Leuit.
19. v. 3^.
in judgment, in line, weight or measure, you shall have just Balances and
true Weights. In the book of Deu. thus. Thou shall not have in thy bag two
manner of weights a great and a small, Deuteronomy. 25. v. 18.
neither shall thou have in thy house diverse measures a great and a small but
thou shall have a right and a just weight, a perfect and a just measure shall
thou have. Again in the Proverbs, False Ballaunces are an abomination unto the
Lord, Pro. 11. v. 1.
but a p rfect weight pleases him. Also in the first Epistle to the
Thessalonians, thus it is written: 1. These. 4. v. 6.
Let no man defraud his brother in any thing (as every one does that uses
false weight or measure,) for the Lord is a revenger of such things. By all
which places and many others that might be cited out of sacred scriptures, it
appears how specially this vprightnes in the use of weight and measure has
ever bin enjoined by God himself, for a continual practice among his people.
And therefore most shameless are they before men, and no less desperate in
dispising the revenging hand of God: who (besides the penalties provided by
civil authority for the holding them in awe) dare go on in so manifest
contempt of his so fearful threats. Leaving therefore these dispisers, to the
disposing hand of the Almighty, either in mercy to amend them, or in justice to
condemn them. I commend this little Pamphlet (shrouded under Gods and my
Countries laws, to the reading, and regarding of the common) yet more
conscionable sort of subjects in the same. As unto whose usual trades
(standing for the most part upon weight and measure,) the practice thereof most
properly apperteineth, and for whose sakes I have satisfied my well meaning, in
delivering them the truth rather homely then handsomely. Like as their
following the same, ought to be in a plain true dealing, and not in a crafty
subtle deceiving, which being the fruit that I hope will ensue my poor pains
taking herein (as a well pleasing taste both to God and man) I will only
content my self with expectation of such reward, committing thee (good
Reader) to the conduct of that spirit that is only able and always ready to
prepare thee for every good duty, and to perform the same in thee,
according to thy proper place and calling.

IN this assise there is no allowaunce given unto the Baker toward his
charges, in the baking of his bread. And the Baker for his offense in breaking
of his assise, he shall be amerced: for the second offense likewise amerced: for
the third offense in breaking his assise he shall be more greueously amerced,
and warned. And if he offend in breaking the assice of his bread the fourth
time (being thereof convicted by order of law) then he shall receive
corporal punishment upon the pillorie, without any redemption, either by
Gold, or Silver. But if the Baker does exceed (in breaking the assise of his
bread) the full weighte of ij. s^. vi. d. which is one ounce and a half in his
Farthing white Lofe, then he shall suffer the judgment of the pillorie without
any fine, or admonition given unto him. Et post Septem dies panis

Allowance to Bakers.
FIrst it is to be remembered, that the foresaid Assise of all sorts of bread,
being many years since established by law, for the good of this Common
wealth. At what time all manner of Fuel and other necessaries needful for the
mystery of Bakers were far better cheap, then now they are: as may plainly
appear by the Bakers allowaunces, for their charges in the batche of a quarter
of wheat, set down by the old sise books, not amounting above the value of
ten pence.

It is therefore berie needful, that all manner of officers having to deal
therein, should have due regard thereunto: In yielding the said Bakers such
reasonable consideration and allowaunces, for and toward their costs and
charges, in baking their breads, as is agreeable unto equity and good
consience: and may likewise answer unto the highness of prices which things
now bear: whereby they may continue their said mysteries, with a due
observation of the true Assise according to the laws in that behalf provided.

And further more if their be any manner of Parson or Parsons which shall by
any false ways, or means sell any meal unto the Queens subjects either by
mixing of it deceitefully, or mustie and corrupted meal, which may be to the
hurt or infection of man's body: orels by any false slight or any deceatfull
ways or means, by false weight or measure, and so deceive the subjects: For
the first offense he shall be grievously punnished, the second offense he shall
lose his meal, the third offense he shall suffer the judgment of the
Pillowrie, and the fowerth time he shall foresweare the Town wherein he
dwells.

Ancient laws and good ordinances set down as well for Bakers, in making,
Sising and selling of all sorts of lawful breads, which by the laws are
vendable unto her Maiestis subjects in the common wealth: as also for
Inholders, Vittulers, and other persons retailing the same, ratified and
allowed by her majesty's most honorable privy counsel, as hereafter follows.
First, that no manner of person or persons shall keep a common Bakehouse, in
Cities and corporate Towns, Bakers to be apprentized,
but such persons as have been aprentized unto the same mystery, or brought
up therein for the more space of seven years, or else otherwise, skillful in
the good making and true sising of all sorts of bread, and shall put his own
proper mark and seal upon all sorts of his man's bread, which he or they
shall make and sell as before is mentioned.

Item, that no Baker or other persons, do make, bake, Lawful breads to be made
and sold.
utter and sell, any kinds or sorts of bread, in the commonwealth: but such
which the Statutes and ancient ordinances of this Realm do allow them to
bake, and sell. That is to say, they may bake, and sell Simnell bread,
wastell, white, wheaton, household, and Horsebreades, and none other kinds of
bread to put to sale unto her Majesty's subjects.

Item, they must make and bake farthing white bread, What sorts of bread are
to be made.
half penny white, penny white, halfe-peny wheaton, penny wheaton bread, penny
household, and two penny household loves, and none of greater Sise, upon pain
of forfeiture unto poor people all such great bread which they or any of them
shall make to sell of greater Sise, (the time of Christmas always excepted).

Item, they shall not utter and sell to any Inholder or Victuler either in man's
bread or horsebread (which shall retaile the same) but only xiij penny worth
for xij. d. without any Poundage or other advantage.

Item, they shall sell and deliver unto Inholders and Victulers, in
horse-bread, xiij pence in bread for xij. pence.
but three Loves for a penny, and xiij pennye worth for xij. d. (as aforesaid)
every one of the same three horse loves waighing the full weight of a penny
white Lofe: whether wheat be good cheap or dear.

Item, that no bakers or other person or persons, shall at any time or times
hereafter, make, utter or sell, by retaile, within or without their houses,
Unlawful breads forbidden.
unto any the Queens subjects any spice Cakes, Bunnes, Biskets, or other spice
breads (being bread out of Sise and not by law allowed) except it be at
Burialls or upon the Friday before Easter, or at Christmas: upon pain of
forfeiture of al such spice breades to the poor.

Item, whereas there are, in Cities or corporate Towns, common Bakers, using
the mystery of baking, there and within the same Towns the foreine Bakers,
which come into the market with their breades to be sold, shall not only
bring with them, Foreign bakers to keep greater sise then the towns men.
such kinds of sorts of Sised breades, as the law and ordinances do allow,
to be made and sold as aforesaid: but also shall keep and observe this
order, in the weight of their breades, as hereafter follows: because the
said forreiners do not bear and pay, within the same Cities or Towns, such
Scotte and Lotte, as the Bakers of the same towns do.

First, the Forreiners half penny white Loves shall wey half an ounce more in
every Lofe, then the Bakers of the same towns half penny white Loves do.

Item, their penny white Loves shall wey, one ounce more in every Lofe then the
Bakers of the same towns penny white Loves do.

Item, their half penny wheaton Loves, shall wey one ounce more in every Lofe,
then the Bakers of the same towns half penny wheaton Loves do.

Item, their penny wheaton Loves, shall wey two ounces more in every Lofe, then
the Bakers of the same towns, penny wheaton Loves do.

Item, their penny household Loves, shall wey two ounces more in every Lofe,
then the Bakers of the same towns, penny household Loves do.

Item, their two penny household Loves, shall weye four ounces more in every
Lofe, then the Bakers of the same towns, two penny household Loves do.

Provided always, that the Clerk of the market of her Majesty's household, his
deputies or deputy, Majors, Bailifes and other Officers, of Cities, Corporat
towns and liberties, shall look unto, have diligent care and respect unto the
due performaunce, and execution of these Articles, and shall and may from time,
to time, freely give and distribute, Penalty.
al such unlawful breades as shall be hereafter made and put to sale being
contrary to these Articles (before mentioned) unto poor prisoners or any
other poor people, willing and requiring al Justices of peace, Constables,
Baylifes, and all other Officers, to be ayding, assisting and helping, all the
foresaid Officers in the due execution hereof, as they will answer to the
contrary at their perils.

Note also, that this Assise of all sorts of bread, Assise of bread after Troy
weight.
ought always to be approved by the Troy weight, derived from the grains of
wheat: whereof two grains, taken in the midst of the ear, makes the xvi.
part of a Sterling penny: iiij. grains makes the eight part of a penny
Sterling: eight grains make the fourth part of a penny Sterling, and two and
thirty grains of wheat, make the whole Sterling penny. Twenty of which
pence, make the ounce Troy, xv. d. three quarters of an ounce, x. d. half an
ounce, five pence a quarter of an ounce, and ij. d. ob. half a quarter of an
ounce, which weight being named Troy weight, serves only to wey, Bread, Gold,
Ounce Troy.
Silver, precious Jewels, and Ellectuaries, of which weighte, there is but xij
ounces to the pound, viij pounds to the gallon, xvi pounds to the pecke,
xxxij. pounds to the half Bushel, and lxiiij. pounds to the Bushel. Anno.
12. H. 7. cap. 5.

There is also an other usual weight, named Auoirdupois weight, whereunto
there is xvi. ounces for the pound, which weight serves to wey Butter,
Cheese, Flesh, Tallow, Wax, and every other thing that bears the name of
Garbell, and whereof issues a refuse or waste. Auoirdupois weight.
The difference between these two weightes, Troy and Auoirdupois, is this,
that xiiii. ounces and a half Troy weight, being xxiiii. s^. ij. d. sterling,
do make xvi. ounces Auoirdupois weight, at this day, and according to the same
rate vii. pounds Auoirdupois, make the gallon in measure: Difference of
weightes.
xiiii. pounds the pecke, xxviii. pounds the half bushel, and lvi. pounds
make the bushel, the which bushel justly accords with the lxiiii. pounds
Troy weight, as is before mentioned. The which lvi. pound of Auoirdupois
weight, are and have been accustomably used, for the content of the bushel
through this Realm, and not repugnant to the law as before is remembered. From
the which weight named Troy, is also drawn the assise or gaige, as well for
all manner of wette measures to be had and used, The measure drawn from ye troy
weight.
both by land and within ship board, as also for all manner of corn and
grain vendable within this Realm of England, which according to the law is to
be observed and kept, as well within liberties as without, both by the buyers
and sellers: that is to say, the full and just weight of xii. ounces Troy in
wheat, do make a concaue or hollow measure named a pint, and viii. of the same
pintes do make the gallon for Wine, Ale, Beer, and Corn, according to the
Standard of her majesty's Exchequier, viii. of which gallons do make the
bushel, Water measure.
and eight of the same bushels do make the quarter in measure. An. 11. and 12.
H. 7. Memorandum, there is allowed by the law for water measure within the ship
board, ten gallons to the bushel, which contain five peckes. An. 11. H. 7.
Cap. 4.

The content of caske.
Furthermore, there is derived and drawn out, and from the said gallon made by
the said eight pintes, which contains twelve ounces of Troy weight to every
pint, as before is declared. The Assise for the quantity and true content of
all manner of caske, lawful and vend^ble within this Realm of England, as well
for Wines, Oil, and Honey, as also for Ale, Beer, and Sauce. That is to say,
every hogshead to have and contain threescore and three gallons, every Tertian
fourscore and four gallons, every Pipe Cxxvi. gallons, and every Tun, CClii.
gallons of the foresaid English gallons, and that no manner of person or persons
shall bring out of any country, or make or cause to be made here within the
Realm of England, any of the said vessels of losser sise or content then
before is declared, An. 2. H. 6. Cap. 11. An. 1. R. 3. Cap. 13. and An. 28. H.
8. Cap. 14.

There is also a certain measure called a Salmon Butte, Salmon measure.
which must hold and contain fourscore and four gallons, the Barrel must
hold and contain, xlii. gallons, the half Barrel one and twenty gallons.
The Hearing Barrel must hold and contain, thirty two gallons. The Eale
barrel forty two gallons, and the half barrel and firkin for Hearings and
Eales, Eales and bearing caske,
must hold and contain according to the same rate, the which gallons must be
also agreeable unto her Majesty's Standard of the Exchequier, and derived as
before is mentioned, Ann. 22. Ed. 4. Cap. 11.

And every Soap barrel to hold and contain 32. Gallons and upwards
according to the Queens maisties standard of Thexchequire, and shall way being
empty xxvi. pounds of Auoirdupois weight and not above, and every half
barrel empty shall way xiii. pounds and not above, and shall hold and contain
xvi. Gallons and above, and every Firkin empty shall way vi. pound and a
half and not above, and shall hold and contain viii. Gallons and above, upon
pain of forfaiture for every barrel, half barrel, Ferking or othed vessel
hereafter to be made had or used contrary to this Act iii s. iiii. d.

There is also ye true weight of a wey of cheese and butter, after the rate of
fiuescore and twelve pounds of Auoirdupois weight to the hundred, as
aforesaid, which two hundredth weight, is a leven score and four pounds,
containing xxxii. cloves, The weight of cheese and butter.
and every cloue to be vii. pounds of Auoirdupois weight. And so the weye of
Suffolk cheese, is two hundredth, quarter and four pounds, which is
tweluescore and sixteen pounds of Auoirdupois weightes, and the barrel of
butter is of like weight, with the Foyst thereof. But the weight of the wey of
Essexs cheese or butter, is three hundredth pounds weight, after the rate of
fiuescore and twelve pounds to the hundredth, which is sixteen score and
sixteen pounds of Auoirdupois weight, Anno. 9. H. 6. Cap. 8.

The sack of wool.
The Sack of Wool is three hundred twenty eight pounds, and a hundred twelve
pounds to every hundred weight, which is xviii. score and four pounds of
Auoirdupois weight, as before is mentioned, An. 11. H. 7. Cap. 4. Two weights
of wool make a sack, and xii. sackes make a last. But a last of Hearings,
contains ten thousand, and every thousand contain ten hundredth. And
every hundredth, contain sixscore, An. 14. Ed. 3. Cap. 12.

There is also a lode of Lead, which consists of thirty formels, The load
of Lead.
and every formell contains six stone wanting two pounds. And every stone
must consist of twelve pound Auoirdupois: and every pound consists of the
weight of five and twenty shillings sterling, whereby the sum in the formell
is seven pound, but the sum of the stones in the load, is eight times twenty
and fifteen. And it is proved by six times thirty, which is, nine times
twenty. But of every formell there are abated two pounds in the foresaid
multiplication, which are sixty, which make five stone. And so there are in
the load eight times twenty and fifteen pounds as is above said. According to
some other, it consists of twelve weightes: and this is after Troy weight.
And the sum of stones in the load, is eight times twenty, and eight stone.
And it is proved by twelve times 14. An. 14. Ed. 3. Cap. 12.

There is likewise a measure ordained by law, named a yard, being derived from
the grains of Barley, as three barley corns in length shall make an inch.
Compositio vlnarum and perticarum. An. 31. Ed. 1.
Twelve of the same inches shall make the foot, three foot shall make the
yard, and sixteen foot and a half, shall make the polle or perch to measure
land or wood withal. In many countries this polle or perch does vary, as in
some places it is eighteen foot, and in some other places xxi. foot, as by
ancient custom is allowed. Of the which polles or pearches, forty in length
and four of them in breadth, The Acre of land.
make the Acre of land or wood, upon which measure, Pliny li. 2. Cap. 23
deriueth Stadium to be a furlong, which contains 125. pases, every pase to
contain five foot: the foot to contain four palms, and every palm
contains four fingers breadth. There are also three kinds of Stadia, the
first is, Stadin or furlong.
Stadium Italicum, containing 625. feet, which is 125. pases: ye second is
Stadium Olimpicum, co^teining 600. feet, which is, 120. pases. The third, is
Stadium Pithicum, co^teining 1000. feet, which is 200. pases, of these Stadia,
eight in length, do make the Italian mile, containing 1000. pases, and every
pase to be five foot in length. And of these pases Iunius writes, The
difference days.
that there is Passus duplex, and passus minor vel simplex, passus duplex, is
five foot as aforesaid, but passus minor vel simplex, is but two foot and a
half, which is usually the distance from the toes of the fore foot, unto the

The Assise and order for Brewers, as well of Ale as of Beer.
IT was also ordained in Anno. 23. H. 8. that the Ale Firking shall hold and
contain viij gallons and vpwardes, the Kilderking xvi. gallons and vpwardes,
Brewers cas^*
and the Ale Barrel, xxxij. gallons and upwards. The beer Firking shall hold
and contain ix. gallons and upwards, the beer Kilderking xviij gallons and
vpwardes, and the beer Barrel xxxvi. gallons and vpwardes, according to the
English gallon, before mentioned.

These being the true contents of Beer and Ale vessels, the Brewers that are
to sell by them, Unwholesome drinks.
are likewise thus restrained by laws. Viz. that they brewe not their Ale nor
Beer of any musty malte or eaton with wiuels, nor put any Ale or Beer to
sale, in any musty or corrupt vessels, or in any vessels of a lesser content
then before mentioned: neither must they make any new vessels within their
own houses, New vessels not to be mad by brewers.
to utter their Ale and Bear in, saving that they may keep Coopers within
their houses, only to Hoope, Cobble, and amend their vessels and not otherwise.

And further more, that every beer brewer and ale brewer with in this Realm
of England, shall not take over and above for every such barrel, Kilderking
or Firkin, of ale or bear, but after the prices and rates as shall be thought
convenient and sufficient by the distression of the Justices of the peace,
within every sheere where such ale brewer or here brewer shall dwell, Prises
for ale and beer.
without any City, Borough, or Town corporate, where no head officers, as
Majors, Bailises, Sheeriffes, or other head officers, have none authority nor
rule: and in every City, Borrought, or Town, where there be Mayor, sheriefes
or other head officers, the same rates and prices to be rated and ceased by
them and every of them by their discressions* And that the fame ale brewers and
beer brewers at any time hereafter shall not sell there beer nor ale, at any
higher rates and prices then shall be unto them assigned after the form above
rehearsed, upon pain to lose and forfait for every barell so put to sale
contrary to this statute vi. s. for every half barell or kilderking iii. s.
iiii. d. for every Firking ii. s. And for every vessel containing gretter
number of Gallons x. s. and for every vessel containing lesser number of
Gallons xii. d. the one half of which penalties and forfeitures shall be unto
the Queens Majesty, her hears and successors: the other half unto him that
will sue for the same, by action debt, bill, plaint, or information in any of
her Majesty's court of record, wherein the defendant shall not wage his law.

And for as much as the mystery of brewing, as a thing very needful and
necessary for the common wealth, has been always by ancient custom and
good orders, practiced and maintained with in Cities, Corporat, Borroughs, and
market Towns of this Realm, by such expert and skillful persons, Brewers to
be apprentizes or skillful men in the mystery.
as either were traded and brought up therein, by the space of seven years,
and as prentize therein accepted: accordingly as in all other Trades and
Occupations, or else well known to be such men of skill and honesty, in that
mystery, as could and would always yield unto her Majesty's subjects in the
common wealth, such good and wholesome Ale and Beer, as both in the quality and
for the quantity thereof, did ever agree with the good laws of the Realm.
And especially to the comfort of the poorer sort of subjects: who most need
it: until of late years, sundry Persons enhabiting within the foresaid
liberties, rather seeking their own private gain, then the public profit
of their country: have not only erected and set up small brewhouses at their
pleasures: but also brew and utter uch Ale and Beer, for want of skill in that
mystery, as both in the prices and holsomnes thereof: does utterly disagree
with the goodlawes and orders of this Realm: thereby also, over throwing the
greater and more ancient brewhouses: and the estate of the said mystery of
brewing. It is therefore very necessary, that the Mayor, Baylifes, or other
hedde Officers of every City, corporate, borough, or market towns within this
realm, where such great and ancient brewhouses are, do take such good order
by virtue of their Charters granted to them, either by her Highness, or her
noble progeniters: as that within these liberties, ye aforesaid ancient
brewers and brewhouses, may be recontinued and maintained, and those new
erected houses, with their unskillful owners, suppressed and put down, which
as it has been, so doubtless would it be the best and surest means of
maintayning that mystery, and unto the common wealths most profit.

The Assise and order for Inholders and Victulers.
AND for that Ale and Beer are not in themselves perfect licures, but being
filled into a small measure, the yeste or froth therefore will assend,
Inholders and victulers.
by working very speedely, requiring a time in settling thereof again, there is
alto used and to be allowed within this realm, sundry measures of lesser
co^tents for Brewers Inholders and Victulers, Thurdendels.

standerd: in respect of the working and assending of the yeste and froth as

Ale and Beer, being after the rate of four pence the gallon: And by the same
thurdendel, and half thurdendel, the Victulers shall retaile their drink,
being after the rate of three pence the gallon, the which said several
measures are lawful and ought to be used in manner aforesaid, at this day.

And furthermore, Inholders, Cooks, and Victulers are, not only by the laws
and ancient good orders of this realm, Unwholesome victuals*
forbidden to bake, seethe, or roste, any fish or flesh twice, or sell and
utter unto the Subjects any manner of corruptible victuals, which may be to
the hurt and the infection of man's body. Anno. ^1. H. 3.
But also that they shall not utter and sell their Ale and Beer, within or
without their houses by retaile or otherwise, unto any the Queens Majesty's
subjects, with any false or unsealed measures, False measures
lesser then the standerd before metioned, nor utter and sell their prouender
within their Ostries, with any false or unsealed measures, which shall be
repugnant unto the foresaid standard of her highness Exchequier. Anno. 11. and.
12. H. 7. cap. 4.

Item if any Butcher, Fishmunger, Inholder, Victuler, Baker, Poulter or any
other whatsoever: which shall sell any victuals unto the subjects at any
excessive price or prises otherwise then the plenty and skarcitie of the time,
and the distance of carriage of the same considered, shall accord with equite
and good conscence. Then Majors Baylifes and other cheef officers of Cities,
Boroughes, and Towns corporate shall have full power and authority: to
enquire and examine all such offenses and defaults therein done and committed,
and to inflict punishment upon the offenders, by ceasing of the double value,
of that which he or they shall so utter and sell, unto the party damnified.
And if the said chief officers shall omit to do their duties heerin: then
the Justices of the peace shall have full power and authority to inflict
punishment upon such negligent and careless officers. Anno. 23. Ed. tercij. cap.
6.

Item it is enacted in Anno. 6. R. 2. cap. 9. That no victuler, or victulers,
within any City, or other Town, or Towns within the Realm of England,
shall use or occupy the office of a judge, during the time that he shall be

exercise the same office) And then whilst he is in that office of a judge he
nor none of his shall utter and sell any victuals unto the subjects upon pain
of forfaiture of the same victuals.

The assise for Inholders, or any others retailing their Hey by the Bottle,
Trusse, or hundredth, as follows.
FIrst the lode, which men call the cart or waineteight, is reckoned to be
twenty hundred weight of Auoirdupois weight, accounting a hundredth and twelve
pounds unto every hundredth, The assise of Heye.
but for as much as her majesty's subjects enhabiting near unto ye City of
London, cannot very easily, or well load their carts or waines with hey, of
such great weight, and so carry the same unto the city. They do reckon and
account eighteen hundredth weight of Auoirdupois weight, to be the common load
of hey, the which they make and sise as follows: that is to sale, that xxxvi.
trusses of hey shall make the load, every trusse of hey, to wey the full
weight of fifty six pounds of Auoirdupois, and after that rate, one pound of
hey sold for a ob. makes four pounds four shillings the load in money: two
pounds of hey for a ob. make xlii. s. the load: three pounds of hey for a ob.
make xxxi. s. vid. the load: and four pounds of hey for a ob. make xxi. s. the
load the which assise or weight in hey, the Inholders and others retailing the
same, ought to observe and keep.

And whereas any Inholders or others do or shall: take or receive any manner of
horse or horses unto liuerie at Heay^ and Litter by day and night. Then if the
bottle of Heye shall way three pounds for a half penny, which is vj. pound for
a i. d. and so xviij. pounds of Heye for three pence, the which xviij pound of
hey with reasonable prouender at every wateringe will suffice one horse day and
night and according to that ra^e the Inholder or any other parson shall make
xxxi. s. vi. d. of his lode of hey: being of the full weight as before is
mentioned then allow him one penny day and night for hie litter, whichin the
hole amounts unto iiij. d day and night for hey and litter, and so shall the
Inholders or any others have sufficient gain in his stable^, if the same horse
shall spend but three half pence in prouender at every watering. And so shall
all manner of officers, appurtionate the Inholders: and all others which use to
take horses by liuerie day and night, as the prices of the lode of hey shall
yearly increase and deminishe.

The Assise for Vinteners.
VInteners must sell good and wholesome wines for the sustenance of man, they

measures, as are agreeable unto the Standard of her Majesty's Exchequier, by
the half pint, pine, quart, pottle and gallon, according to the approved
Standard before mentioned.

The Assise for Butchers.
IT has been always a thing most carefully looked unto, and provided for, by
good and ancient orders and laws of this Realm, Anno. 51. H. ^. and. An. 31.
Ep. 1 cop. 7.

deceive the ignorant buyers thereof: upon like pain. Nor uttered and sell any
meseled Porke, upon pain of amercement, Deceiptes of Butchers.
and to suffer the judgment of the Pillory, with his corrupt flesh to be
burned openly before his face, in the market place. Likewise that they shall

enclining more unto the one end, then unto the other, thereby to deceive the
subjects, nor sell their flesh by or with any false weight, lesser then the

ounces Auoirdupois to the pound, and eight of them pounds to make the stone, or

ignorant, for the true order and assise of weight and measure, with the assise
of bread and other necessaries, concerning the same, to be observed by all
subjects, as a thing very necessary and needful in the common wealth. The
which both Gods book, the good laws and ancient orders of the Realm, do
allow and maintain, wishing every good subject to embrace the same accordingly.
