OH! the Day, the dreadful and terrible Day of God, that lives for ever; Who
may abide the Day of his Vengeance, fierce Wrath and fiery Indignation? Who can
escape the Rod of his sore Displeasure, that with a strong hand is lifted up,
in the Day that is revealed unto Destruction and Perdition of all the Rebellious
and Ungodly, that have done despite unto the Eternal Spirit of Grace, and yet
hate to be Reformed by the same, which has strived and appeared to all Men?
Oh! the Day of Vengeance, of the fiery and fierce Wrath of the Almighty, that is
ready to break forth, as a mighty Stream or irresistible Flood: As Wickedness
has desperately and mightily rushed in, and overflowed the Land; so certainly
the Wrath, the Fury, the Vengeance, the Woes, the Plagues of Eternal Judgment,
as swiftly are hastening, and ready to be poured forth and executed; for a
Consumption is determined throughout the whole Land, hearken ye that forget
God, and know him not as he is Eternal Life, neither obey the Everlasting
Gospel: Woe to the Hipocrites and double minded ones, no Hiding Place for you;
Woe to the Drunkards, and Swearers, no Hiding Place for you; Woes and Vengeance
to all ye proud, lustful Ones, that are making Provision for strange Flesh, and
setting up Idols in your unclean hearts, and streets, and bowing down your
heads and hearts to the same, the works of men's hands, dead Images, Stocks, and
dry Trees: Oh! ye hard hearted, cursed Generation, the terrible God, with the
breath of his Lips, as a Consuming Fre in his great displeasure, will destroy
you from off the face of the Earth, and ye shall be no more; The mouth of the
Lord has spoken it: Blessed shall they be that yet can find a place of
Repentance unto Life, in the same to live for ever: And so my spirit says,
AMEN.
