BY THE KING.
Trusty and welbeloved, We greet you well.
Having observed in the Presidents and customs of former times, That the Kings
and Queens of this our Realm upon extraordinary occasions have used either to
resort to those contributions which arise from the generality of subjects, or
to the private helps of some well-affected in particular by way of loan; In
the former of which courses as We have no doubt of the love and affection of
Our people when they shall again assemble in Parliament, so for the present We
are enforced to proceed in the latter course for supply of some portions of
Treasure for diverse public services, which without manifold inconveniences to
Us and Our Kingdoms, cannot be deferred: And therefore this being the first
time that We have required any thing in this kind, We doubt not but that We
shall receive such a testimony of good affection from you (amongst other of Our
subjects) and that with such alacrity and readiness as may make the same so much
the more acceptable, especially seeing We require but that of some, which few
men would deny a friend, and have a mind resolved to expose all Our earthly
fortune for preservation of the general; The sum which We require of you by
virtue of these presents is (...) which We do promise in the name of Us, our
Heirs and Successors to repay to you or your Assigns within eighteen
months after the payment thereof unto the Collector. The person that We have
appointed to collect, is (...) to whose hands we do require you to send it
within twelve days after you have received this Privy Seal, which together
with the Collectors acquittance, shall be sufficient warrant unto the Officers of
Our Receipt for the repayment thereof at the time limited.

Given under our Privy Seal at (...) the (...) day of (...) in the first year
of our reign of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland. 1626.
