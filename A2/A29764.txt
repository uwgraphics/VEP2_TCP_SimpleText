THE TRIANGULAR QUADRANT: Being a GENERAL INSTRUMENT for Observations at Land
or Sea, performing all the Uses of all ordinary Sea Instruments for
Observations, with more speed, ease and conveniencie than any of them all will
do.

Contrived and made by John Brown at the Sphere and Sun-dial in the Minories,
and sold there or at Mr H. Suttons behind the Exchange. 1662.

THE Description, and some uses of the Triangular Quadrant, or the Sector made
a Quadrant, or the use of an excellent Instrument for observations at Land or
Sea, performing all the uses of the Forestaff, Davis quadrant, Bow, Gunter's
crosstaff, Gunter's quadrant, and sector; with far more convenience and as much
exactness as any of them will do.

The Description.
First, it is a jointed rule (or Sector) made to what Radius you please, but
for the present purpose it is best between 24. and 36 inches Radius, and a
third piece of the same length, with a tennon at each end, to make it an
Equilateral Triangle; from whence it is properly called a Triangular Quadrant.

^^Secondly, as to the lines graduated thereon, they may be more or less as
your use and cost will please to command, but to make it complete for the
promised premises, these that follow are necessary thereunto.

1. A Line of degrees, of twice 90. degrees on the moveable leg, and outer edge
of the cross piece: for quadrantal and back observations. 2. Such another Line
of 60. degrees, for forward observations on the inside of the cross piece. 3.
On the moveable leg* a Kallender of Months, and days in 2 lines. 4. Next to
them, a Line of the Suns place in degrees. 5. Next to that, a Line of the Suns
right Assention, in degrees or hours. 6. Next above the Months on the same Leg,
an hour and Azimuth Line, fitted to a particular Latitude, as London, or any
other place, for all the uses of Gunter's Quadrant as you may find in the
former discourse (called a Joynt-rule.) 7. On the head leg, and same side, a
particular scale of altitudes, for the particular Latitude. 8. Next to that a
general scale of Altitudes, for all Latitudes. 9. A Line of 360 degrees,
divided so as to serve for 360 degrees of 12 Signs; and 24 hours, (and in foot
and 2 foot rules for inches also.) 10. A Line of 29 laid next to the former,
serving to find the Moons coming to South, and her age, and place, and the time
of the Night, by the fixed Stars. 11. A perpetual Almanac, and the right
Assension, and declination of several fixed Stars. 12. A Line of Lines next the
inside, may be put on without Trouble, or incumbering one another, all these on
one side.
Secondly, on the other side may be put the Lines of natural Signs, Tangents
and Secants, to a single, double, and treble Radius, and by this means more
then a Gunters Sector, (the particular Lines being inscribed between the
general Lines.)

Thirdly on the other edge there may be Artificial Numbers, Tangents, Signs,
and versed Signs, and by this means it is a Gunters Rule or a Crosstaff.

Fourthly, on the insides, inches, footmeasure, and a Line of 112. parts, and a
large meridian Line, or the like: as you please.

Lastly, two sliding nuts with points in them, fitted to the Cross piece, makes
it a proper beam Compass to use in working by the Numbers Signs and Tangents on
the edge, or flat side, also it must have four or five sights, a Thread, and
Plummet, and Compasses, as other instruments have, thus much for the
Description, the uses follow.

An Advertisement.
First, for the better understanding and brevity sake, there are ten things to
be named and described, as follows; 1. the head leg, in which the brass Revet
is fixed, and about which the other turn; 2. the moveable leg, on which the
Months and Days must always be; 3. the Cross piece, that is fitted to the head,
and moveable Leg, by the two Tennons at the end; 4. the quadrant side where the
degrees and Months are, for observation. 5. the other or Sector side for
operation, 6thly the head center, being Center to the degrees on the inside of
the cross piece, for a forward observation as with the forestaffe. 7 The other
Center, near the end of the head leg, being the Center to the moveable leg, for
backward observations, (as the Davis quadrant is used, and the bow) which you
may call the foot center, or leg center for backward observations.

8thly the sights, as first the turning or eye sight, which is always, set on
one of the centers, with a screw to make it fast there, which I call the
turning sight, 9thly the Horizon sight that cuts the degrees of altitude, and
sometimes is next to the eye, and sometimes remote from the eye, yet called the
horizon (slideing) sight, 10thly. the object or shadow sight of which there
may be 3 for convenience sake, as two fixed and one moveable to slide as the
horizon sight does: the other two do serve also to pin the cross piece, and
the two legs together, through the two tennons, all whose names in short take
thus:

1. The head leg: 2. the moveable leg: 3. the cross piece: 4. the quadrant
side: 5. the sector side, 6. the head (or forward) center. 7 the leg (or
backward) center. 8. the turning sight. 9. the (slideing) horzon sight. 10. the
object (or shadow) sight. of which there be 3. all differing according to your
use and occasions: one to slide to any place, the other 2. to be put into
certain holes. nigher, or further off: as will afterward largely appear.

THE USES:
I. To find the suns declination, true place, right assention, and rising, the
day of the month being given.
First open the rule to an angle of 60. degrees, which is always done when the
cross piece is fitted into the Mortesse holes, and the pins of the object
sights put in the holes through the tennons, or else by the second Chapter of
the Joynt-rule: then extend a thread from the center pin in the head leg, to the
day of the month, and on the degrees it cuts the suns declination, in the line
of right assention his right assention, in the line of true place his true
place, and in the hour line his true rising and setting, in that latitude the
line is m^de for: Example, on the first of May I would know the former
questions, the rule being set by the cross piece, and the thread on the leg
center pin; and drawn straight and laid over May 1. it cuts in the degrees 18.
4. north declination, and 20. 58. in Taurus for his place, and 3 hours 14.
minutes right assention in time, or 48. 32. in degrees: and the rising of the
sun that day is at 4. 23, and sets at 5. 37, in 51. 32 latitude.

The finding of hour and azimuth, either particularly, or generally, with other
Astronomical propositions, are spoken enough of before in the Joynt-rule, and
in all other authors that write of the Sector, or Gunter's rule, so that all I
shall speak of now, shall be only what was forgot in the first part, and what
is new as to the using the instrument in sea observations.

II. To find the Suns or a Stars Altitude, by a forward Observation.
Skrew the turning sight to the head Center, and set that object sight, whose
holes answer to the Sliding horizon sight, in the hole at the end of the head
leg, and put the horizon sight on the cross piece next the inside; Then
holding the cross piece with your right hand, and the turning sight close to
your eye, and the moveable leg against your body, with your thumb on the right
hand thrust upwards, or pull downwards, the horizon sight: till you see the sun
through the object sight, and the horizon through the horizon sight, then the
degrees cut by the middle of the horizon sight, on the cross piece shall be
the true altitude required:

III. To perform the same another way.
If your instrument be parted, that is to say the cross piece from the other,
and an altitude be required to be had quickly, then set the two object sights,
in two holes at the end of the line of natural signs, then set the head of the
rule to your eye, so as the sight of the eye may be just over the Center, then
open or close the Joint, till you see the horizon through one sight, and the
sun or star through the other, then is the sector set to the angle required, to
find which angle do thus, take the parallel sign of 30 and 30, and measure it
from the Center, and it shall reach to the sign of half ^he angle required.

Example.

Suppose I had observed an altitude, and the distance between 30 and 30, should
reach from the center to 10. degrees on the signs, then is the altitude of the
sun 20. degrees for 10 doubled is 20.

IIII. To find the suns Altitude by a back observation,
Skrew the Turning sight to the leg center, (or center to the degrees on the
moveable leg) and put one of the object sights, in the hole by 00. on the outer
edge of the cross piece, and set the edge of it just against the stroke of 00,
or you may use the sliding object sight and set the edge or the middle of that,
to the stroke of 00, as you shall Judge most convenient; and the horizon sight
to the moveable leg, then observe in all respects as with a Davis quadrant,
till looking through the small hole of the horizon sight, you see the cross
bar and button, in the turning sight, cut the horizon: and at the same instant
the shadow of the edge or middle of the object or shadow sight, fall on the
middle of the turning sight, by sliding the horizon sight higher or lower, then
the middle stroke of the horizon sight, shall cut on the moveable leg, the suns
true altitude required. As f(...)t stay at 50 degrees, then is the sun 50
degrees above the horizon.

V. But if the sun be near to the Zenith or 90 degrees high, then it will be
convenient to move the object sight, to a hole or two further as suppose at 10,
20, 30 degrees more, toward the further end of the cross piece and then
observe as you did before in all respects, as with a Davis quadrant, and then
whatsoever degrees the horizon sight cuts, you must ad so much to it, as you
set the object sight forwards, as suppose 30, and the horizon sight stay at 60,
then I say 60, and 30, makes 90: the true altitude required. Note that by this
contrivance, let the altitude be what it will, you shall always have a most
steady observation: with the instrument leaning against your breast, a
considerable thing, in a windy day, when you may have a need of an observation
in southern voyages, when the sun is near to the zenith at a Meridian
observation.

VI. To find the suns distance from the zenith, by observing the other way, the
sun being not above 60 degrees high, or 30 from the zenith.
Set the turning sight as before on the leg Center, then set an object sight in
one of the holes in the line on the head leg, nigher or further of, the turning
sight: as the the brightness or dimnesse of the sun will allow to see a
shadow, then looking through the small hole on the horizon sight, till you see
the horizon cut by the cross bar of the great hole, in the turning sight,
turning the foreside of that sight, till it be fit to receive the shadow of the
middle of the object sight; then the degrees cut by the horizon sight, shall be
the suns true distance from the zenith, or the complement of the Altitude.

VII. Note that by adding of a short piece about 9 inches long on the head leg,
whereon to set the slideing shadow sight, you may obtain the former convenience
of all angles, this way also, at a most steady and easy manner of observation;
but note whatsoever you set forwards on that piece, must be subtracted from
that the sight shows, and the remainder shall be the suns distance from the
zenith required.

As suppose you set forward 30 degrees, and the horizon sight should stay at
40, then 30 from 40 rest 10, the suns distance from the zenith required; thus
you see, that by one and the same line, at one manner of figuring, is the suns
altitude, or coalitude acquired and that at a most certain steady manner of
observation.

VIII. To find an observation by thread and plummet, without having any respect
to the horizon, being of good stead in a misty or cloudy day at land or sea.
Set the rule to his angle of 60 degrees by putting in the cross piece, then
skrew the turning sight to the head center, then if the sun or star be under 30
degrees high, set the object sight in the moveable leg, then looking through
the small hole in the turning sight, through the object sight, to the middle of
the star or sun, as the button in the cross bar will neatly show; then the
thread and plummet, hanging on the leg center pin, and playing evenly by the
moveable leg, shall show the true alti^ude of the sun, or star required
counting the degrees as they are numbered, for th: north declinations from 60
toward the head with 10 20, As if the thread shall play upon 70 10 then is the
altitude 10 degrees.

IX But if the sun or star be above 30 degrees high, then the object sight must
be set to the hole in the end of the head leg: then looking as before, and the
thread playing evenly by the moveable leg, shall show the true altitude
required, as the degrees are numbered.

Note that if the brightness of the sun should offend the eye, you may have a
piece of green, blew, or red glass, fixed on the turning sight, or else remove
the object sight nearer to the turning sight, and then let the sun beams pierce
through both the small holes, according to the usual manner and the thread
shall show the true altitude required. Note also if the thread be apt to slip
away from his observed place, as between 25 and 40 it may: note a dexterious
handling thereof will naturally show you how to prevent it:

X. To find a latitude at Sea by forward meridian Observation or Altitude.
Set the moving object Sight to the Suns declination, showed by the day of the
Month, and rectifying Table, and skrew the turning sight to the leg center, and
the Horizon sight to the moveable leg, or the outside of the Cross piece,
according as the Sun is high or low (but note all forward observations
respecting the Horizon, ought to be under 45 degrees high, for if it be more it
is very uncertain, by any Instrument whatsoever, except you have a Plummet and
then the Horizon is useless) then observe just as you do in a forward
observation, moving the Horizon sight till you see the Sun through the Horizon
sight, and the Horizon through the object sight, or the contrary. (moving not
that sight that is set to the day of the Month or Declination,) then whatsoever
the moving sight shall show, if you add 30 to it, it shall be the latitude of
the place required; observing the difference in North and South Latitudes; that
is, setting the sight to the proper declination, either like, or unlike, to the
latitude-

Example. Suppose on the 10. of March when the Suns declination is 0 -- 10.
North, as in the first year after leap year it will be, set the stroke in the
middle of the moving object sight to 10 of North Declination, and the Horizon
sight on the moveable leg, then move it higher or lower, till you see the
Horizon through one, and the Sun through the other, then the degrees between,
is the Suns meridian altitude, if it be at Noon, as suppose it stayed at 21 30*
then by counting the degrees between, you shall find them come to 38. 40. then
if you add 30. to 21. 30. it makes 51. 30. the Latitude required, for if you do
take 0 10 minutes from 38. 40. there remains 38. 30. the complement of the
Latitude. Note, that this way you may take a forward observation, and so save
the removing of the ^urning sight.

Note also, That when the Horizon sight shall stay about the corner, you may
move the object sight 10. or 20. degrees toward the head, and then you must
add but 20. or 10 degrees to what the sight stayed at; or if you shall set the
sight the other way 10 or 20. degr. then you must add more then 30 so much. As
suppose in this last observation, it had been the latitude of 45 or 50 degrees,
then you shall find the sight to play so near the corner, that it will prove
inconvenient, then suppose instead of 0 10. I set it to 20 degrees 10 North
declination, which is 20. degrees added to the declination, then the Suns
height being the same as before, the sight will stay at 41. 30. to which if you
add 10 degrees, it does make 51. 30. as before; here you must add but 10
degrees, because you increased the declination 20. degrees; but note by the
same reason, had you set it to 19. 50. South declination, then it had been
diminished 20 degrees, and then instead of 30 you must add 50* to 1 - 30. the
place where the sight would have stayed. Thus you see you may very neatly avoid
this inconvenience, and set the sights to proper and steady observations, at
all times of observation.

XI. To find the latitude by a backward Meridian Observation at Sea.
This is but just the converse of the former, for if you set one sight to the
declination, either directly, (or augmented or diminished as before, when the
moving sight shall stay, about the corner of the Triangular Quadrant) then the
other being slipped to and fro, on the outside of the Cross piece, till the
shadow of the outer edge, shall fall on the middle of the turning sight, then
30 just, or more or less added, to that number the moving sight stayed at,
(according as you set the first Horizon sight to the declination) shall be the
true latitude required. Example. Suppose on the same day and year as before, at
the same Noon time, I set my Horizon sight to just 10 of North declination, you
shall find the moving sight to stay at 21. 30. near to the corner, now if the
Sun shine bright, and will cast the shadow to the turning sight, then set the
Horison sight at the declination, forward 10 or 20. degrees, then the moving
sight coming lower you, add but 20. or to that it shall stay at, and the sum
shall be the latitude.

But it is most likely that it will be better to diminish it 20. degrees, then
the moving sight will stay about 2 - 30. on the Cross piece, and so much the
better to cast a shadow; for if you look through the Horizon and turning sight
to the Horizon, you shall find the shadow of the former edge of the moving
shadow sight, to stay at 2 - 30. to which if you add 20. the degrees
diminished, and 30. it makes 51 30. the latitude required as before.

Note also for better convenience of the shadow sight, when you have found the
true declination, as before is taught, set the moving object sight to the same,
on the Cross piece, counted from 00. toward the head leg, for like latitudes
and declinations; and the other way for unlike latitudes and declinations, then
observing as in a back observation, wheresoever the sight shall stay, shall be
the complement of the latitude required. If you add or diminish consider
accordingly.

Note likewise, when the declination is nere the solstice, and the same way as
the latitude is, and by diminishing, or otherwise the moving sight shall fall
beyond 00 on the Cross piece; Then having added 30. and the degrees diminished
together, whatsoever the sight shall stay at beyond 00 must be taken out of the
added sum, and the remainder shall be the latitude required.

Example. Suppose on the 11. of June, in the latitude of 51 30 north, for the
better holding sake I diminish the declination 30 degrees, that is in stead of
setting it to 23. 32. north declination, I set it to 6: 28 south then the sun
being 62 degrees high will stay at 08. 30. beyond 00. the other way now 30 to
be added, and 30 diminished, makes 60, from which take 8. 30, rest 51 30 the
latitude required.

XII. To find a latitude with thread and plummet, or by an observation made
without respecting the Horizon.
Count the declination on the cross piece (and let 00 be the equinoctial and
let the declination which is the same with the latitude be counted toward the
moveable leg, and the contrary the other way, as with us in north latitude,
north declination is toward the moveable leg, and south declination the
contrary and contrarily in south latitudes) and thereunto set the midst of
the sliding object or horizon sight, then is the small hole on the turning
sight and the small hole on the horizon sight, two holes whereby the sun beams
are to pierce to shine one on the other: then shall the thread show you the true
latitude of the place required. Example.

Suppose on the 11 of December. 1663, at noon I observe the noon altitudes set the
middle of the Horizon sight to 23* 32 counted from 00. toward the head leg end,
then making the sun beams to pierce through the hole of this, and the turning
sight, you shall find the plummet to play on 51. 30, the latitude required,
holding the turning sight toward the sun.

Note also that here also you may avoid the inconvenience of the corner, or the
great distance between the sights, by the remedy before cited, in the back and
forward observation.

For if you move it toward the head leg, then the thread will fall short of the
latitude, if toward the moveable leg then it falls beyond the latitude, as is
very easy to conceive of:

Thus you see all the uses of the forestaff, and quadrant, and Mr. Gunter's bow
are plainly and properly applied to this Triangular quadrant, that the same
will be a Sector is easy to persuade you to believe, and that all the uses of
a Gunter's quadrant, are performed by it, is fully showed in the use of the
Joynt-rule, to which this may be annexed, the numbers signs and tangents and
versed signs makes it an excellent large Gunter's rule, and the cross piece is
a good pair of large compasses to operate therewith; lastly, being it may lie
in so little room it is much more convenient for them, with whom stowage is
very precious, so I shall say no more as to the use of it, all the rest being
fully spoke to in other Authors, to whom I refer you: only one useful
proposition to inure you to the use of this most excellent instrument, which I
call the Triangular Quadrant.

Note that in finding the latitude, it is necessary to have a table of the suns
declination for every of the four years, viz. for the leap year and the 1, 2
and 3d. after, now the table of the suns declination whereby the months are
laid down, is a table that is calculated as a mean between all the 4 years, and
you may very well distinguish a minute on the rule; now to make it to be exact
I have fitted this rectifying table for every Week in the year, and the use is
thus: hang the thread on the center pin, and extend the thread to the day of the
month, and on the degrees is the suns declination, as near as can be for a
common year, then if you look in the rectifying table for that month, and week
you seek for you shall find the number of minutes you must add to or substract
from the declination found for that day and year: Example, suppose for April
10. 1662. the second after leap year, the rule shows me 11. 45, from which
the rectifying table says I must substract 3 then is the true declination 11
42, the like for any other year. Note further that the space of a day in the
suns swiftest motion being so much, you may consider the hour of the day also,
in the finding of a latitude, by an observation taken of the Meridian, as anon
you shall see that as the instrument is exact, so let your arithmetical
calculation be also: by laying a sure foundation to begin to work upon, then
will your latitude be very true also.

The Declination of the Sun being given, or rather the Suns Distance from the
Pole, and the Complement of two Altitudes of the Sun, taken at any time of the
day, knowing the time between: to find the Latitude.
Suppose on the 11. of June, the Sun being 66 degrees, 29 distant from the
North Pole, and the Complement of one altitude be 80. 30. and the Complement of
another altitude 44. 13. and the time between the two observations just four
hours; then say,

As the Sine of 90 00 To Sine of Suns did. f. the Pole 66 28 So is the Sine of
time betw. 30 00 To the Sine of the 3d. side 27 17 27 17 of a Triangle as A B.

Then say, as S. of 90 90 00 To S. of Suns did. from Pole 66 28 So is the Sine
of A B 54 35 To the Sine of a fourth Sine 48 23 Then as that 4 to Sine of sum
93 46 So is S. of the difference 27 18 To a seventh Sine 37 44 or the versed
Sine of P A B 77 02 Then to find Z A B Z B is 80 30 And Z A is 44 13 The former

sine of Z A B 116 07

Then if you take P A B from Z A B there will remain Z A P 39 05 Then say again
by the rule as before,

As the sine of 90 00 To Cosine of Z A P 50 55 So is the Tang of A Z 44 13 To
the Tangent of A C 37 04 which taken from A P 66 28 remains P C 29 24 Then
lastly say, As the Cosine of A C 52 56 To the Cosine of C P 60 36 So is the
Cosine of Z A 45 47 To the Cosine of Z P 51 30

The Latitude required to be found. This Question or any other may be wrought
by the Sines and Tangents and versed sines on the rule, But if you would know
more as concerning this or any other, you may be fully satisfied by Mr. Euclid
Spidal at his Chamber at a Virginal Makers house in Thred-needle Street, and at
the Kings head near Broadstreet end.
