By the Queen.
A Proclamation by her Majesty's commandment, forbidding the making or forging
of any Iron Ordonance, about the quantity of the piece commonly called the
Minion, without the Queens special license and prohibiting also the carriage
out of the Realm to any foreign parts, of any manner of Ordonance of brass or
Iron, upon the pains hereafter contained in the Proclamation.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty being certainly informed, that
notwithstanding that it is unlawful to transport any Ordonance of Brass on
Iron out of the Realm without special license, other then for her Majesty's
natural subjects, to be used in their shipping on the Seas abroad, and yet not
to be by them aliened to Strangers: yet diverse evil minded persons have
presumed for their private commodity to do the contrary, even to the
furnishing of the enemy. For the stay hereof, her Majesty does now straightly
command all manner of persons to forbear to ship in any be vessel
whatsoever, any kind of Ordonance of Brass or Iron, with intent to transport
the same into any foreign parts, or to sell or deliver any such Ordonance to
any person to transport the same, upon the pains already limited by the
laws, and such other punishment as is due to them, that do arm and give
strength to her enemies, and thereby incur her indignation, which her
Majesty justly must and will extend, for that it is most evidently seen by
daily experience that by such unlawful transportations, her Majesty's enemies
are either directly or indirectly furnished for the most part with such
Ordonance. And for a further remedy against the inconvenience that is most
generally seen to arise by making of great quantity of great Iron Ordonance,
and by selling the same to sundry persons, who have secretly carried the same
out of the Realm, whereby the common enemies have been furnished therewith not
only in their: shipping, but also in their Maritime Towns and Ports, where
otherwise without the same, they had not been able nor durst have put their
ships to the Seas: Her Majesty does most straightly charge, upon pain of her
indignation and punishment due thereto, all manner of persons that be the owners
of any Iron works, Furnaces or Forges, or that do make or cause to be made any
Iron, that none of them shall make, forge, or cause to be made, any manner of
Ordonance above that manner of piece, which is called a Minion, and that to be
accounted of no greater weight then of fifteen hundred or sixteen hundred
pound weight, Except that her Majesty shall for any special consideration,
license any person to make any other kind of Ordonance above the Minion. And
furthermore though her Majesty thinks it reasonable and necessary that
Ordonance of Iron be made for the use of the ships of her natural subjects,
to serve for their defense upon the Seas, yet her Majesty means to mescribe
certain orders, and to appoint certain persons of authority to see the same
executed, how her subjects, shall and may provide for their necessary shipping
and defense, such Iron Ordonance, as shall be necessary for them, to be only
used in their shipping for their defense, and not to be directly or indirectly
or indirectly transported out of the Realm, or sold or delivered to any
Stranger being not her Majesty's natural subject, upon such pains as are
above expressed.

Given at Sudeley Castle the xi. day of September, in the xxxiiii. year of
our reign.
