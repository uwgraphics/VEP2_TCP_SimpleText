A Proclamation for the finding out and apprehending of Sir Giles Mompesson
Knight.
WHereas Sir Giles Mompesson, Knight, being Conuented before our Commons house
of Parliament, and there questioned for many heinous offenses and
misdemeanors, to the intolerable grieuance of our good and loving Subjects,
the great dishonor of Our Person, and scandal of Our government, has out of
the guilt of his own conscience, as it is to be presumed, whilst he was
there under examination, and for fear of condign punishment, which might be
inflicted upon him for the same, made an escape out of the custody of the
Sergeant of that house, to whom by their Order he was committed, for security
of his person to be forth coming, upon occasion of further trial.

We therefore, out of Our known and wonted zeal to Justice, and out of Our
tender and princely care, that offenders of so foul a nature as this seems
to be, under whose oppressions Our loving Subjects do so much suffer, to our
great grief and displeasure, when We are truly informed thereof, may not
escape and avoid the hands of Justice, but that to the terror and example of
others, they may be brought forth to receive their Trial, Censure and
punishment according to their demerits; Do hereby straightly charge and
command, all and every Our Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants of any County within
this Our Realm, Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Customers, Comptrollers,
Searchers, and other Officers of Our Ports, Constables, Headboroughs, and all
other Our Officers and loving Subjects whatsoever, within Liberties or without,
to use all possible diligence and endeavor, for the searching and finding out
of the said Sir Giles Mompesson, in any part of this Our Realm, and him to
apprehend, and safely to convey and bring unto Our Tower of London, and there
to deliver him into the hands of the Lieutenant of Our Tower, to be safely
kept, until further order be taken by the House of Parliament for proceeding
against him. And this Our Royal Commandment to be forthwith carefully
executed, by all and every Our said Officers, and others to whom it may in any
wise appertain, upon pain of Our High displeasure, And as they will answer
the contrary at their uttermost perils.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the third of March, in the eighteenth year
of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.

most Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XX.
