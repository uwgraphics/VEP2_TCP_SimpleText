A Proclamation for restraint of disorders in Soldiers, prested for his
Majesty's Service.
THe Kings most Excellent Majesty, being informed of the great Spoils,
Damages, and Losses that his loving Subjects lately suffered by the Uiolences
and Disorders committed by Soldiers, when they last passed through the
several Counties of this Realm to the Port of Dover; And His Majesty having
a tender care to secure His loving Subjects, both in their Persons and Goods,
against all such offenses or fears, Has therefore thought fit, with the
advice of His Privy Council, for repressing and preventing the like Attempts,
Acts, or Injuries, by this Proclamation, to give solemn warning, and publish
His Royal Commandment concerning the same; wherein, to the end all pretense
of Disorder shall be taken from the Soldiers, His Majesty in the first place
does give strict charge and Command, to all Captains, Lieutenants, Corporals,
Conductors, and all other Officers, who have, or shall have any charge or
command of Conducting any of the several Companies, appointed out of the
several Counties of this Realm, to Plymmouth, That they do, not only see
the Soldiers of their several Bands and Charges respectively, duly paid
their Conduct-Monies, and provided for of fit necessaries in their passage, but
do also carefully Lead and Conduct them from place to place, whither they are
to go, keeping always with their Companies, and suffering none of them upon
any pretense to wander or straggle from the rest.

Secondly, That no person or persons whatsoever, after he or they has, have,
or shall receive his or their Prest-money, do presume to absent or hide
himself when he shall be called to go with the Companies, nor being in
company, shall wander or straggle from his or their colors, or from the
Captain, Lieutenant, Corporal, Conductor, or other Officer, to whom the
conducting of them shall be assigned; but that they all behave themselves quietly
and orderly, as becomes good Subjects, without offering injury or violence in
their passage to any others, either in their persons, families, goods or
cattle, or fall into any outrage or disorder amongst themselves.

And if any of the said Soldiers shall, notwithstanding this public Warning,
and their Captains or Conductors care and restraint, break out and commit any
outrage, take or spoil any man's house or goods in the Towns or fields as they
pass, straggle from their Companies, or otherwise outragiously behave
themselves, That then every such Soldier so offending, be by virtue of this
His Majesty's Proclamation, forthwith committed to the Constable of the place
next adjoining, and by him in safe and sure manner conducted to the Jail of the
County, there to remain without Bail or Maineprise, until he shall be
proceeded against by the strictest course of Law which his fact shall deserve,
for an example to others to avoid the like offenses.

And for the better execution of this His Majesty's honorable, just, and
necessary Commandment, His Majesty straightly charge and commands all
Lieutenants, Deputy Lieutenants, Majors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace,
Bayliffes, Headboroughs, and other Officers, and all other His Majesty's good
and loving Subjects, to take care to prevent and repress all such disorders,
as aforesaid, and to be ayding and assisting to the said Captain and
Captains, or other Conductor or Conductors of Soldiers respectively, and to
such Constable and Constables, as shall have the charge of conducting any such
disorderly Soldiers to the Jail respectively, in the due execution of this
His Majesty's commandment concerning the premises, as they tender their duty
and allegiance to His Majesty, and the peace and good of their Country, and
will answer for the contrary at their uttermost perils.

Given at the Court at White Hall, the fifteenth day of May, in the first year
of the Reign of our most gracious Sovereign Lord King CHARLES, of Great
Britain, France and Ireland. God save the King.

most Excellent Majesty. ANNO DOM. M.DC.XXV.
