A delicate new Ditty composed upon the Posie of a Ring: being, I fancy none
but thee alone: sent as a New Years gift by a Lover to his Sweetheart.
To the tune of Dulcina.

THou that art so sweet a creature,
that above all earthly joy,
I (...) deem^ for thy rare feature,
kill me not by seeming coy,
nor be thou mute
when this my suit
Into thy ears by love is blown,
but say by me,
as I by thee,
I fancy none but thee alone.
Had thou Cupids mothers beauty,
and Dianaes chaste desires,
Think on that which is thy duty,
to fulfill what love requires:
it is love I ask,
and it is thy task
to be propitious to my moan,
for still I say,
and will for aye,
I fancy none but thee alone.
Let not self conceit ore-straine thee,
woman was at first ordained
To serve man, though I obey thee,
bring by loves law constrained,
my sobs and tears,
true witness bears
of my hearts grief and heavy moan,
let not thy frown
then me cast down,
Who fancies none but thee alone.
Think what promise thou did give me,
when I first did thee behold,
There thou vow'dst thou would not leave me
for a mass of Indian gold,
but now I find
thou art unkind,
all former vows are past and gone,
yet once again
him entertain:
Who fancies none but thee alone.
Let my true affections move thee
to commiserate my pain,
If thou knew'st how dear I love thee,
sure thou would love me again:
I thee affect,
and more respect
thy welfare then I do mine own,
let this move thee
to pity me,
Who fancies none but thee alone.
Why should women be obdurate,
and men's proffers thus despise?
Dear, be ruled, we have a Curate,
nuptial Rites to solemnize:
thou Marigold,
whose leaves unfold,
when Tytans rays reflect thereon,
on thee I Will shine,
for thou art mine,
I fancy none but thee alone.
The second part, Or the Maidens kind Reply. To the same tune.

Dear I have received thy token,
and with it thy faithful love,
Prithee let no more be spoken,
I to thee will constant prove,
do not despair,
nor live in care
for her who vows to be thy own,
though I seem strange,
I will not change,
I fancy none but thee alone.
Think not that I will forgo thee,
though I Am absent from thy sight,
When I find my self kept from thee,
I Would be with thee day and night,
but well thou know
how I am crossed,
else should my love to thee be shown,
with free accord,
yet take my word,
I fancy none but thee alone.
This Proverb has often been used,
she that is bound must needs obey,
And thou see how I Am enclosed,
from thy presence night and day,
I dare not show
what love I owe
to thee, for fear it should be known,
yet still my mind
shall be inclind,
To fancy none but thee alone.
Though my body for a season,
be absent from thee perforce,
Yet I pray thee judge with reason,
that I love thee nere the worse:
Oh that I might
enjoy thy sight,
then should my love to thee be shown,
then do not think
her love to shrink,
Who fancies none but thee alone.
Many times I think upon thee,
in my melancholy fits,
When I find my self kept from thee,
it depriues me of my wits,
often times I weep,
when others sleep;
producing many a grievous groan,
then think on me,
as I on thee,
And fancy none but me alone.
No fastidious motions move me,
to be from thy sight so long,
Do not then (my dear) reprove me,
nor suspect I do thee wrong,
for he thou sure,
I do endure,
in constancy surpast by none,
I long to see
the time that we
shall of two bodies be made one,
FINIS.
Printed at London for H. Gosson on London Bridge.
