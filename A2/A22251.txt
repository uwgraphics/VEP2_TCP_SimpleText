A Proclamation for the Banishing of Giles Mompesson.
WHereas Giles Mompesson, late Knight, for great and insufferable crimes by him
committed, to the abuse of his Majesty, and grievous oppression of his
Subjects, has by the high Court of Parliament been declared to be Degraded
of the Order of Knighthood, and sentenced and adjudged to sustain and bear
other punishments, as by the Record of the foresaid Judgment appears: The
Kings most Excellent Majesty approouing in all things the just proceedings and
sentence of the same his high Court of Parliament; Which to prevent, the said
Mompesson (while the matters were in examination) escaped from his Keeper, and
fled, and is not now to be found. Nevertheless, His Majesty (desiring to
assure all his loving Subjects, how hateful and offensive it is to His
Majesty, that His people should be so injured, molested, vexed or oppressed,
and willing by the severity of His Justice to deter all others from any like
attempt or enterprise hereafter) has resolved (over and besides all the
punishments inflicted upon the said Mompesson, by the Judgment of Parliament)
to add this further punishment, in detestation of his offenses, utterly to
Banish and expel the said Giles Mompesson out of His Realms of England,
Scotland, and Ireland, and all other His Majesty's Dominions, as a person
infamous and unworthy to partake of any the comforts of His Majesty's happy
Government. And therefore His Majesty does hereby expressly charge and command,
that the said Giles Mompesson, if now he be abiding within any of His Majesty's
Dominions, do forthwith, after the publication hereof, depart and withdraw
himself out of the same: And that after such his departure, or if he be now in
any parts out of His Majesty's Dominions, that he do not at any time hereafter
return into the same or any of them, upon pain to incur, not only the
seuerest and uttermost execution of the said Sentence and Judgment of
Parliament, but the forfeiture of whatsoever he may forfeit to His Majesty,
and of all such further punishment as His Majesty in His Kingly power and
prerogative may inflict upon him.

Given at Our Palace of Westminster the thirtieth of March, in the nineteenth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save the King.
