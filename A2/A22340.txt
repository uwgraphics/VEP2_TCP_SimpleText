By the King. A Proclamation for the utter prohibiting the importation and use
of all Tobacco, which is not of the proper growth of the Colonies of Virginia
and the Summer Islands, or one of them.
WHereas, at the humble suite of Our Commons in Parliament, by Our Royal
Proclamation, bearing date the nine and twentieth day of September now last
past, for the reasons therein contained, We have prohibited the importation and
use of all Tobacco, which is not of the proper growth of Our Colonies of
Virginia and the Summer Islands, or one of them; And whereas, upon the humble
Petition of many Our loving Subjects* being Planters or Adventurers in those
Colonies, and for the support and encouragement of those Plantations (whose
prosperous estate We much affect, and shall by all good means be always ready
to cherish and protect) We have been contented to tolerate the use of Tobacco,
of the growth of those Plantations for a time, until by more solid Commodities
they be able to subsist otherwise, which (as We are informed) they cannot as
yet by any means do; And therefore by Our said Proclamation, We did think
fit to give particular directions in many things tending to those ends, and did
straightly command the due execution and observation thereof, under the penalties
therein contained: Now because We have been informed, as well by the humble
Certificate of Our Commissioners for Virginia, as by the humble Petition of
diverse of Our loving Subjects, the Planters and Adventurers of, and in those
Colonies, That, notwithstanding Our Royal pleasure was so expressly
signified. and the reasons of State are so plainly laid down, as might have
persuaded every well affected Subject to the due observance thereof; yet
diverse, out of an inordinate desire of private gain, have wilfully disobeyed
Our commandment herein, and thereby have indeauoured, as much as in them
lies, to destroy so noble a work as the support of those Plantations, which
so much concerns Our Honor, and the honor and profit of Our people.

We therefore, being very sensible of this neglect and contempt, have thought
good to renew Our said Proclamation; And do hereby signify and declare unto
all Our loving Subjects, and unto all others, Our express will and pleasure to
be, That Our said former Proclamation, and every clause, prohibition, article
and thing therein contained, shall from henceforth be duly observed and
obeyed, with such alterations and additions, as are in these presents contained
and expressed, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such penalties and
punishments, as in Our said former Proclamation are, or in these presents shall
be limited or appointed for the offenders thereof.

And whereas some have since Our said last Proclamation, vnmerchantlike,
secretly and cunningly stolen in great parcels of Tobacco, contrary to Our
said Proclamation; We would have those persons, and all others by their
example know, That they must expect the severity of that censure, which Our
Court of Star Chamber shall think fit to inflict upon them, and that We are
resolved not to relent or remit their deserved punishment, but to cause them
and all others, that shall dare to offend herein, to be prosecuted and
punished in such measure, as such their high contempt does deserve.

And because We conceived it would be utterly in vain to prohibit the
importation of such foreign Tobacco, as aforesaid, unless the care and ch^rge
of the execution thereof were committed by Us, to some fit and able persons,
who besides the respect to Our service, might for their own particular
interests take the same to heart; Therefore We have by Our Letters Patents
under Our great Seal of England, authorized certain persons, Citizens of
London, well affected to those plantations, an Our service, by themselves, and
their Deputies, to search and inquire into the offenses, and offenders against
Our said Proclamation: And We have also contracted with them to be Our Agents
for Us, and to Our use to receive the Tobacco of those Colonies, at, and for
such prices as We have agreed to give for the same; and besides those prices,
to be given to the Planters and owners of the said Tobacco, Our said Agents
have further contracted with Us, to give and pay unto Us, and to Our use, such
sums of money more, as may give Us reasonable satisfaction for that loss,
which otherwise We should sustain in Our Customs and other Duties, and may
enable Us to bear that charge, which We have undertaken yearly to disburse
for the general defense and support of those Plantations. And We do further
by this Our Proclamation publish and declare, that We will constantly and
inuiolably observe and perform Our said contract, and on Our parts, will allow
and disburse out of Our reuenew, those sums of money for the safety of those
Plantations, and for the ease of the Planters and Inhabitants there, which by
the said contract has been on Our parts undertaken; whereof We would have,
as well Our said Agents, as the Planters and Adventurers in those Colonies, and
all other whom it may concern, to rest confidently assured.

And because We are given to understand, that diverse using to trade in
Tobacco, and having a purpose to import, or buy, or sell the same, contrary to
the intent of this Our Proclamation, do usually land the same at private
Wharffes, Stairs, or other places, and send, or conueigh the same unto the
Houses, Cellers, Warehouses, or other places, of, or belonging to others, who
are less suspected then themselves, thereby to conceal the same from Us, and
Our Agents; We further will and command, That from henceforth no person
whatsoever, presume, or suffer the said prohibited Tobacco to be landed at any
Wharffe, Staire, or other place, nor receive, or conceal any such prohibited
Tobacco, or suffer the same to be bestowed in any of their Houses, Cellers,
Warehouses, or other places, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and upon such
pains and penalties, as by this, or Our former Proclamation, are to be
inflicted upon the principal offenders. And to the intent that all the
prohibited Tobacco brought in, shall be justly and truly exported again, and no
part thereof sold, or vented within these Our Kingdoms; Our will and command
is, That all the prohibited Tobacco which shall be seized within Our Kingdom
of England, shall be brought and delivered into the Warehouse, or Storehouse
which shall be to that purpose provided by the said Agents, in Our city of
London; and all the prohibited Tobacco, which shall be seized within Our
Kingdom of Ireland, shall be brought and delivered into the Warehouses, or
Storehouses which shall to that purpose be appointed by Our Agents in Our city
of Dublin, or elsewhere within Our said Kingdom of Ireland.

And for the encouragement of those, who shall take pains in the discovery and
seizing thereof, Our will and pleasure is, That the one half of the reasonable
value thereof, shall be paid unto the seizers thereof in money by Our Agents,
and the Tobacco it self shall be exported again by Our said Agents, or by
their appointments: And for the better execution of Our service herein, We do
hereby give full power and authority, as well to Our Agent and Agents, as to
their Deputy and Deputies, at all time and times, to enter into, and to search
for any prohibited Tobacco, contrary to this Our Proclamation, in any Ship,
Boat, or vessel, or in any House, Shop, Celler, Soller, Warehouse, or in any
Trunk, Chest, Case, Barrel, or Pack, Cabin, or any other suspected place
whatsoever, and finding any such prohibited Tobacco, the same to seize and carry
away, to be conveyed to such place or Warehouse, as Our said Agent shall
appoint for that purpose, as aforesaid.

And Our express will and command is, That neither Our said Agents, nor any
others, do sell, or utter any part of the said prohibited Tobacco, within any
Our own Dominions, there to be spent and used, whereby the vent of the
Tobacco of Our Colonies aforesaid may any way be hindered, upon pain of Our
heavy displeasure, and such other pains and penalties, as other offenders
against this Our Proclamation are liable unto.

And whereas by Our former Proclamation, We did command, that from, and after
the five and twentieth day of March, then, and now next ensuing, no person
should sell, utter, or offer to put to sale, or use any Tobacco, which is not
of the proper growth of the Colonies aforesaid, and before the end of forty
days then next ensuing, should transport out of Our said Kingdom, all other
Tobacco, then that of the growth of those Colonies; We do now by this Our
Proclamation, ratify and confirm the same, and command, the same to be duly
put in execution: And to the end there may be no evasion used to avoid the
same, We do hereby give full power and commandment to Our said Agents, by
themselves and their Deputies, at any time, or times after the said five and
twentieth day of March now next ensuing, to search for the said prohibited
Tobacco, and to take a true and exact note and account of the quantity thereof,
to the intent that the Owners thereof, before the end of forty days next
ensuing after the said five and twentieth day of March, either by themselves,
or some other, may export the same by the priuity of the said Agents, according
to the true intent of this, and of Our said former Proclamation, and at the end
of the said forty days, may give a just account unto Our said Agents, what is
become thereof; and whatsoever Tobacco which is not of the proper growth of the
Plantations aforesaid, shall after the said forty days be found in the hands
of any person whatsoever, shall be seized by Our said Agents, or their
Deputies to Our use, and the said person or persons having or using the same,
shall incur Our high displeasure, and be subject to such further pains and
penalties, as by Our said Proclamation are to be inflicted upon any other
offenders.

And Our further will and command is, that all the Tobacco of the growth of Our
Colonies aforesaid, shall be brought to the Custom House key of Our port of
London, and there be delivered to Our Agents, or their Assignees to Our use,
according to Our contract aforesaid, or be kept in Our said Custom House to
be transported out of Our Dominions; and whatsoever Tobacco of the growth of
those Plantations, or either of them, shall not be brought to that Key, and be
delivered as aforesaid, or for which there shall not be good security given to
Our Agents, within fourteen days after the landing thereof, to export the
same as aforesaid, the same shall be forfeited and seized to Our use by Our
Agents or their Deputies, as other prohibited Tobacco, and this to be duly
observed under the pains and penalties aforesaid.

And whereas We are given to understand, that diverse using to trade in
Tobacco. have and still do secretly and underhand steal into Our Kingdoms
the said prohibited Tobacco and do so privily hide and conceal the same, that
they cannot be easily discovered, nor found out, and do either by themselves,
or others by them to that purpose employed, carry the same by small quantities
to the houses or shops of Our subjects, inhabiting within Our said Kingdoms,
and do sell or profer the same to be sold, or else do secretly and covertly
offer to contract for the sale of such prohibited Tobacco; Our will and
pleasure is, and We do hereby straightly charge and command all and every Our
loving subjects, to whom any the said prohibited Tobacco shall be offered to be
sold or contracted for, as aforesaid that immediately upon the sight of any
such prohibited Tobacco, or upon offer to contract for any such Tobacco, they
make stay thereof, and of such person or persons, as shall either profer the
same to sell, or shall offer to contract for any the said prohibited Tobacco,
and that they and every of them, who shall have the said prohibited Tobacco so
proffered unto them to be sold, as aforesaid, shall give notice thereof, and
charge the next Constable, Head-borough, or other Officer, with such person or
persons, who shall offer to put the same to sale, upon pain of Our high
displeasure, and of such other pains and penalties, as other offenders against
this Our Royal Proclamation are liable unto. And We do hereby further charge
and command all and singular Constables, Head-boroughs and other Our Officers
aforesaid, that they and every of them, upon notice unto them given of any such
prohibited Tobacco, as aforesaid, or of any such person and persons so
offending, as aforesaid, that they seize the said Tobacco, and detain all such
person and persons so offending as they shall have knowledge of, until they
have given notice thereof unto Our said Agents or their Deputy or Deputies,
and until by their means the person offending may be brought before such
Officer as has power by this Our Proclamation to take sufficient bond for the
appearance of such person, in some of Our Courts of justice, to answer for
their faults as the same shall deserve.

And for the better finding out and discovery of the offenses and offenders
against Our former and this Our Proclamation, We are well pleased, and do
hereby require and command, that Our Treasurer, Commissioners for Our Treasury,
Chancellor and Barons of Our Exchequer now, and for the time being, within Our
said Kingdoms of England and Ireland, respectively shall and may award such
and so many Commissions, as they shall think meet, to be directed to discreet
and fit persons in all or any Our Ports, or elsewhere, to enquire of and
examine upon oath, or otherwise, all such persons as are, or shall be suspected
to have heretofore offended, or which hereafter shall offend against this, or
Our former Proclamation in this behalf, or any other person or persons
whatsoever, for the finding out and discovery of the said offenses and
offenders, as is before mentioned; to the end that, as well the importers of
such Tobacco as the buyers, sellers, spenders, receivers and concealers
thereof, may receive such condign punishment by fine or otherwise, for their
offenses, as by Our Court of Star Chamber, or Court of Exchequer shall be
thought fit: And in case such Tobacco shall not, or cannot be taken, or found
to be seized, that then every such offender shall forfeit and pay to the hands
of Our Agent or Agents, in this behalf for Our use, the full value of such
Tobacco, as the said offenders heretofore have, or hereafter shall have
imported, bought, sold, vented or received, as aforesaid, beside such further
punishment, as shall be fit to be inflicted upon them for their contempt.

And Our further will and pleasure is, and We do hereby declare, That
whatsoever Our said Agent or Agents, their Assignee or Assignees, under the
hands and seals of the greater number of them, have already done, or shall do
hereafter against any offender or offenders, in requiring and taking the
forfeiture of any Tobacco, or the value thereof so imported or uttered as
aforesaid, or in the mitigating or taking any less sum then the value of the
same of any such offender in the premises, or otherwise according to the good
discretion of Our said Agent or Agents, We do and will from time to time
approve and allow of by these presents: And this signification of Our pleasure
shall be as well unto Our said Agent or Agents for the time being, as unto all
and every such Commissioner and Commissioners which have been, or shall be
employed, in, or about this Our service, a sufficient warrant and discharge in
that behalf, without any account to be by them, or any of them respectively
yielded to Us, Our Heirs or Successors, and without incurring any penalty in
the doing or executing of this Our Service and Royal Command.

And forasmuch as heretofore diverse great quantities of Tobacco have been
imported into this Realm, under the name or names of sundry poor Mariners,
and other, which are not able to pay the value thereof, nor give satisfaction
for the same, Our will and pleasure is, the better to avoid such frauds and
deceipts in time to come, That in whatsoever Ship, or other Uessel, any such
Tobacco in greater or lesser quantities, shall be found or discovered to have
been, or to be so imported* and to be shifted away that seizure thereof
cannot, or shall not be made, That then such Mariners, or others, who shall so
import or color the said Tobaccoes, shall not only be punished, as aforesaid,
but that every Master of such Ship or Uessell, wherein such Tobacco shall be so
imported or shifted away, as aforesaid, shall forfeit to Us the value of the
said Tobacco, and that such Ship or Ships shall be arrested, and stayed by the
Officers of every Port, or any of Our Agents, their D^puties or Assignees
respectively, until the said forfeiture be duly answered and paid to the hands
of Our said Agent or Agents to Our use, or such others as they shall appoint in
that behalf.

And for the better execu^^on of the (...), We do straightly charge and
command all Justices of Peace, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bailiffes, Constables, Hea^
boroughs, Tythi^gmen, Our Warden and Constable of Our Cinque Ports, and all
other Our Officers and Ministers, as well of Our Admiralties, as otherwise, and
all other Our loving Subjects, to whom it shall or may appertain, that they
and every of them at all time and times hereafter, and from time to time, upon
sight of Our Letters Patents, granted to Our said Agents, or of a Deputation
under the hands and seals of Our Agents, or any three of them, be ayding and
assisting to Our said Agent and Agents, and their Deputy and Deputies, and to
such Our Commissioners, as shall be from time to time appointed for or about
this Our service, And also to be from time to time ayding and assisting to all
Our Searchers, Wauers, and to all such other person and persons as shall be
authorized by Our said Agent or Agents, or by Our Customers or Farmers of Our
Customs, for the searching, seizing, taking, and carrying away of all such
Tobacco imported, or hereafter to be imported or uttered, or intended to be put
to sale contrary to this Our Royal prohibition and command. And if any person
or persons shall be found, privily or secretly to oppose or animate any
others, to contradict or withstand them in the due execution of this Our
service and Royal command, or to neglect the due execution thereof, That then
We do by these presents, straightly charge and command, all and every Our said
Officers respectively, that every such person and persons shall be apprehended
and brought before Our Treasurer, Chancellor of Our Exchequer, or before any
the Lords or others of Our Privy Council, or before Our chief Baron, or some
other of the Barons of Our Exchequer for the time being, to receive such order
for condign punishment to be inflicted upon them according to their demerits,
as shall be fit.

Given at Our Court at Theobalds, the second day of March, in the two and
twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
