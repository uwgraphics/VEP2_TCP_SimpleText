His Majesty's DECLARATION To all His loving Subjects: Of the causes which
moved him to dissolve the last Parliament.
THE KINGS most Excellent Majesty well knows, That the Calling, Adjourning,
Proroguing, and Dissolving of Parliaments, are undoubted Prerogatives
inseparably annexed to his Imperial Crown, of which he is not bound to render
any account but to God alone, no more then of his other Regal actions.

Nevertheless his Majesty, whose Piety and Goodness have made him ever so
order and govern all things, That the cleernesse and candor of his Royal heart
may appear to all his Subjects, especially in those great and public Matters
of State, that have relation to the weal and safety of his People, and the
honor of his Royal person and government: Has thought fit, for avoiding and
preventing all sinister constructions and misinterpretations, which the malice
of some persons ill-affected to his Crown and Sovereignty, has, or may
practice to infuse into the minds and ears of his good and faithful Subjects,
to set down by way of Declaration, the true causes as well of his Assembling, as
of his Dissolving the late Parliament.

IT is not unknown to most of his Majesty's loving Subjects, what
discouragements he has formerly had by the undutifull and seditious carriage
of diverse of the lower house in preceding Assemblies of Parliament, enough to
have made him averse to those ancient and accustomed ways of calling his
people together, when in stead of dutiful expressions toward his Person and
Government, they vented their own malice and disaffections to the State, and by
their subtle and malignant courses, endeavored nothing more then to bring
into contempt and disorder all Government and Magistracy.

Yet his Majesty well considering that but few were guilty of that seditious
and undutifull behavior, and hoping that time and experience had made his
loving Subjects sensible of the distemper the whole Kingdom was in danger to be
put into by the ill governed actions of those men, And his Majesty being ever
desirous to tread in the steps of his most noble Progenitors, was pleased to
issue forth his Writs under the great Seal of England, for a Parliament to be
holden on the thirteenth day of April last.

At which day, his Majesty by the Lord Keeper of His great Seal was graciously
pleased to let both houses of Parliament know, how desirous he was, That all
his people would unite their hearts and affections in the execution of those
Councels that might tend to the Honor of his Majesty, the safety of his
Kingdoms, and the good and preservation of all his people. And withal how
confident he was that they would not be failing in their duties and affections
to him and to the public.

He laid open to them the manifest and apparent mischiefs threatened to this and
all his other Kingdoms, by the mutinous and rebellious behavior of diverse of
the Scottish nation, who had by their examples drawn many of his Subjects there
into a course of disloyalty and disobedience not fit for his Majesty in
honor, safety, or wisdom to endure.

How to strengthen themselves in their disloyal courses, they had addressed
themselves to foreign States, and treated with them to deliver themselves up
to their protection and defense, as was made apparent under the proper hands of
the prime Ringleaders of that Rebellious faction.

These courses of theirs, tending so much to the ruin and overthrow of this
famous Monarchy, united by the descent of the Crown of England upon his
Majesty, and his Father of blessed memory; his Majesty (in his great wisdom,
and in discharge of the trust reposed in him by God, and by the fundamental
laws of both Kingdoms, for the protection and government of them) resolved to
suppress, and thereby to vindicate that sovereign power entrusted to him. He
had by the last Summers trial found, that his grace and goodness was abused,
and that contrary to his expectation and their faithful promises, they had,
since his being at Barwick, and the Pacification there made, pursued their
former rebellious designs, and therefore it was necessary now for his Majesty
by Power to reduce them to the just and modest condition of their obedience and
subjection, which when ever they should be brought unto, or seeing their own
errors, should put themselves into a way of humility and obedience becoming
them, his Majesty should need no other Mediators for Clemency and Mercy to
them, then his own Piety and Goodness, and the tender affection he has ever
born to that his native Kingdom.

This being of so great weight and consequence to the whole Kingdom, and the
charge of an Army, fit to master such a business, amounting to so great a sum
as his Majesty had no means to raise, having not only emptied his own
coffers, but issued between three and four hundred thousand pounds which he
borrowed of his servants, upon security out of his own estate, to provide such
things as were necessary to begin such an action with; his Majesty after the
example of his Predecessors, resorted to his people in their representative
body the Parliament, whom he desired (with all the expressions of grace and
goodness which could possibly come from him) That taking into serious and
dutiful consideration the nature of these bleeding evils, and how dangerous it
was to lose the least minute of time, lest thereby those of Scotland should
gain opportunity to frame their parties with foreign States, that they would
for a while lay aside all other debates, and pass an Act for the speedy
payment of so many Subsidies as might enable his Majesty to put in readiness
for this Summer those things which were to be prepared before so great an Army
could be brought into the field.

For further supply necessary for so great an undertaking, his Majesty
declared that he expected it not till there might be a happy conclusion of that
Session, and till their just grievances might be first graciously heard and
relieved.

Wherein, as his Majesty would most willingly have given them the precedence
before matter of supply, if the great necessity of his occasions could have
permitted, so he was graciously pleased for their full assurance and
satisfaction therein to give them his Royal word, That without determining the
Session upon granting of the Subsidies, he would give them before they parted,
as much time as the season of the year, and the great affairs in hand would
permit, for considering all such Petitions as they should conceive to be good
for the Commonwealth, and what they could not now finish, they should have
full time to perfect toward Winter; his Majesty graciously assuring them, that
he would go along with them for their advantage through all the expressions of
a gracious and pious King, to the end there might be such a happy conclusion of
that as might be the cause of many more meetings with them in Parliament. From
their first assembling until the 21. of April, the house of Commons did
nothing that could give his Majesty any content or confidence in their speedy
supplying of him: Whereupon he commanded both the houses to attend him in the
Banqueting house at Whitehall in the afternoon of that 21. day of April. Where
by the Lord Keeper his Majesty put them in mind of the end for which they
were assembled, which was for his Majesty's supply, That if it were not speedy,
it would be of no use unto him; Part of the Army then marching at the charge of
above a hundred thousand pounds a month, which would all be lost if his
Majesty were not presently supplied, so as it was not possible to be longer
forborne. Yet his Majesty then expressed that the supply he for the present
desired, was only to enable him to go on with his designs for three or four
months, and that he expected no further supply till all their just grievances
were relieved.

And because his Majesty had taken notice of some misapprehensions about the
levying of the Shipping-money, his Majesty commanded the Lord Keeper to let
them know, That he never had any intention to make any Revenue of it, nor had
ever made any; but that all the money Collected had been paid to the Treasurer
of the Navy, and by him expended, besides great sums of money every year out
of his Majesty's own purse.

That his Majesty had once resolved this year to have levied none, but that he
was forced to alter his resolution, in regard he was of necessity to send an
Army for reducing those of Scotland, during which time it was requisite the
Seas should be well guarded: And besides his Majesty had knowledge of the
great Fleets prepared by all neighboring Princes this year, and of the
insolences committed by those of Algiers, with the store of Ships which they
had in readiness.

And therefore though his Majesty for this present year could not forbear it,
but expected their concurrence in the levying of it, yet for the future to give
all his Subjects assurance how just and Royal his intentions were, and that
all his aim was but to live like their King, able to defend himself and them,
to be useful to his friends and considerable to his enemies, to maintain the
Soveraigntie of the Seas, and so make the Kingdom flourish in trade and
commerce, he was graciously pleased to let them know, That the ordinary Revenue
now taken by the Crown could not serve the turn, and therefore that it must be
by Shipping-money or some other way, wherein he was willing to leave it to
their considerations what better course to find out, and to settle it how they
would, so the thing were done which so much imported the honor and safety of
the Kingdom; and his Majesty for his part would most readily and cheerfully
grant any thing they could desire for securing them in the propriety of their
goods and estates, and in the liberty of their persons.

His Majesty telling them it was in their power to make this as happy a
Parliament as ever was, and to be the cause of the Kings delighting to meet
with his people, and his people with him.

That there was no such way to effect this as by putting obligations to trust
and confidence upon him, which as it was the way of good manners with a King,
so it was a surer and safer course for themselves, then any that their own
jealousies and fears could invent, his Majesty being a Prince that deserved
their trust, and would not lose the honor of it, and a Prince of such a
gracious nature that disdained his people should overcome him by kindness.

He had made this good to some other Subjects of his, and if they followed his
counsel, they should be sure not to repent it, being the people that were
nearest and dearest to him, and Subjects whom he did and had reason to value
more then the Subjects of any his other Kingdoms.

His Majesty having thus graciously expressed himself unto them, he expected
the House of Commons would have the next day taken into consideration the
matter of Supply, and laid aside all other debates till that were resolved of
according to his desire.

But instead of giving an answer therein, such as the pressing and urgent
occasions required, they fell into Discourses and Debates about their pretended
Grievances, and raised up so many, and of so several natures, that in a
Parliamentary way they could not but spend more time then his Majesty's great
and weighty affairs could possibly afford.

His Majesty foreseeing in his great wisdom that they were not in the way to
make this a happy Parliament, which he so much desired and hoped, That nothing
might be wanting on his part to bring them into the right way for his honor,
the safety of the Kingdom, and their own good, he resolved to desire the
assistance of the Lords of the higher house, as persons in rank and degree
nearest to the Royal Throne, and who having received honor from him and his
Royal Progenitors, he doubted not would for those and many other reasons be
moved in honor and dutiful affection to his Person and Crown, to dispose the
house of Commons to express their duties to his Majesty, in expediting the
matter of Supply, for which they were called together, and which required so
present a dispatch.

For this purpose, his Majesty in his Royal Person came again to the Lords
house on Wednesday the 24. day of April, where himself declared to the Lords
the cause of his coming, which was, to put them in mind of what had been by
the Lord Keeper in his name delivered unto both houses the first day of the
Parliament, and after at Whitehall, how contrary to his expectation the house
of Commons having held consultation of Matter of Religion, Property of goods,
and Liberty of Parliament; and voted some things concerning those three heads,
had thereby given them the precedence before the matter of his supply, That his
necessities were such, they could not bear delay, That what ever he had by the
Lord Keeper promised he would perform, if the house of Commons would trust him.
For Religion, that his heart and conscience went together with the Religion
established in the Church of England, and he would give order to his
Archbishops and Bishops, that no innovation in matter of Religion should creep
in. For the Ship Money, that he never made or intended to make any profit to
himself of it, but only to preserve the Dominion of the Seas, which was so
necessary, that without it the Kingdom could not subsist; but for the way and
means by Ship Money, or otherwise he left it to them. For property of goods,
and liberty of Parliament, he ever intended his people should enjoy them,
holding no King so great as he that was King of a rich and free people, and if
they had not property of goods, and liberty of persons, they could be neither
rich nor free. That if the house of Commons would not first trust him, all his
affairs would be disordered, and his business lost. That though they trusted
him in part at first, yet before the Parliament ended he must totally trust
them, and in conclusion they must for execution of all things wholly trust him.
Therefore since the matter was no more then who should be first trusted, and
that the trust of him first was but a trust in part, his Majesty desired the
Lords to take into their considerations his and their own Honor, the safety
and welfare of this Kingdom, with the great danger it was in, and that they
would by their advice dispose the house of Commons to give his supply the
precedence before the grievances.

His Majesty being departed, the Lords took into serious consideration what
his Majesty had commended to their care, and forthwith laying aside all other
debates, such was their Lordships dutiful and affectionate carriage, they
remembering well what had been formerly declared in his Majesty's name to both
houses, his Majesty's gracious promises and expressions then and at this time,
with the pressing and urgent occasions which so much imported the honor of his
Majesty and the good of this Kingdom, their Lordships delivered their votes in
these words, We are of opinion that the matter of his Majesty's supply should
have precedence, and be resolved of before any other matter whatsoever; And we
think fit there shall be a conference desired with the house of Commons to
dispose them thereunto.

Accordingly the next day being Saturday the 25. day of April, a Conference was
had in the Painted Chamber by a Committee of both Houses, where the Lord
Keeper, by the Lords command, told the House of Commons of his Majesty's being
the day before in person in the higher House, how graciously he had expressed
himself, in matter of Religion, Property of Goods, and Liberty of Parliament;
and that he would therein graciously hear and relieve them, and give them what
in reason could be desired, with the effect of what else had bin graciously
delivered unto them by his Majesty, as well touching his constant Zeal and
affection to the Religion established in the Church of England, as touching the
Ship Money, and the necessity of his affairs, which was such, that delay was as
prejudicial as denial, and that if time were lost, both Houses could not
recover it; and therefore their Lordships, though they would move nothing, nor
give any advice concerning Subsidies, but decline it, as that which naturally
was to begin with the House of Commons, yet being alike interessed and
concerned in the honor and safety of the Kingdom, they held it fit to let them
know their opinions and desires, which was, That they should go first on with
the matter of his Majesty's supply, as that which was most necessary and fit to
have precedence; And that being done, they would cheerfully join with them in
the presenting of their Grievances.

The House of Commons having heard their Lordships opinion and desire, instead
of concurring with their Lordships in preferring the consideration of his
Majesty's supply before their Grievances, they spent the whole day on Monday
following being the 27. of April, in taking causeless exceptions to what had
been at the Conference related to them; And the next day being Tuesday the 28.
of April, they desired a Conference with the Lords, and their Lordships meeting
them presently in the Painted Chamber, they were so far from their expressing
of any willingness to join with their Lordships in what had been upon so
weighty reasons recommended unto them, that on the contrary they challenged the
Lords for invading the Privileges of the House of Commons, Alleging, That
the Lords having in the former Conference acknowledged that the matter of
Subsidy and Supply ought to begin in the House of Commons, had in their voting
that it was fit and most necessary that matter of Supply should have precedence
before all other business, not only been transported beyond the bounds which
their Lordships had formerly set to themselves, but by meddling with matter of
Supply, had as far as in them lay, concluded both the matter and order of
proceeding, which the House of Commons took to be a breach of their Privilege,
and for it desired reparation of their Lordships.

And because the Lords had in the first Conference enumerated those three
particulars, of Religion, Propriety of Goods, and Privilege of Parliament, the
House of Commons collected they had taken notice of some proceedings in their
House concerning those particulars, and thereby broken another great Privilege
of the House of Commons established in Parliament, and called, The Indemnity
of the Commons.

This how strange and unexpected soever, the Lords heard with patience, and
being desirous to remove all impediments, and clear any mistakings that might
retard or avert the resolutions of supplying his Majesty, they seriously
debated in the higher house what had been objected by the house of Commons, and
resolved, first, That their Lordships former voting, That in their opinions his
Majesty's supply should have precedence before all other matters, was no breach
of the Privileges of the House of Commons. And secondly, That it was no breach
of the Privileges of the house of Commons for their Lordships to hear what his
Majesty declared to them, and thereupon to report the same to the House of
Commons.

And to the end the house of Commons might have a right understanding of their
Lordships proceedings, their Lordships desired another Conference with them,
which was accordingly had on Friday the first of May in the painted Chamber,
where by the command of the Lords, the Lord Keeper declared to the house of
Commons, That the Lords of the higher house had, as in duty and affection to
his Majesty's Crown and government they were bound, taken into serious
consideration the great and weighty motives of his Majesty's calling this
Parliament, The great evils and calamities that hung over their heads, and the
apparent danger the Kingdom was like to run into, if by speedy and fitting
supply his Majesty were not enabled to prevent it. How insupportable delay and
protraction was, and how impossible for both houses to recover the loss of
time in a matter of so pressing and urgent necessity. That his Majesty had
both in the higher house, and in the Banqueting house at Whitehall, expressed
his gracious and Princely desire to do all that from a just and gracious King
might be expected, whereby this Parliament might have a happy conclusion. How
his Majesty had promised all their just grievances should be graciously heard
and relieved. That their Lordships were witnesses his Majesty had given his
Royal word herein, which their Lordships for their parts did as much trust and
confide in as ever Subjects did.

It was also then further declared unto them, That his Majesty had lately
honored their house with his presence again, and had there renewed the
remembrance of what had before been delivered to both Houses, with the
impossibility of admitting delay, and the clearnes of his Majesty's intentions
and resolutions, to give all just satisfaction to what with reason could be
desired of him.

That his Majesty had taken notice of somewhat voted in the House of Commons
concerning Religion, propriety of Goods, and liberty of Parliament, by which
his Majesty conceived the matter of his supply set aside, which he had so
often and with such weight of reason desired might have precedence.

That his Majesty after very gracious assurances of his constant affection and
zeal for true Religion, and for preventing all Innovations therein, reiterating
his often promises for relieving all their just grievances, with his Royal
intentions in that particular of Ship Money which he found much stood upon, was
pleased to desire their Lordships (as Persons in rank and degree nearest him,
in Honor as much or more concerned then other, and in the safety and
prosperity of the Kingdom at least equally interessed with others) That in a
case of this great and important weight, their Lordships would by their
counsel and persuasion incline the House of Commons to give his Majesty a
speedy answer and resolution in the matter of Supply. That their Lordships had
taken his Majesty's desire into serious and dutiful consideration, and upon
great and solemn debate had, only voted in these words, We are of opinion that
the matter of His Majesty's supply should have precedence, and be resolved of
before any other matter whatsoever. And that they did think fit there should be
a Conference desired with the house of Commons to dispose them thereunto; which
as it was just and honorable for their Lordships to do, so it was no breach of
any privilege of the house of Commons.

For though their Lordships did admit, That the Bill of Subsidies ought to
begin in the House of Commons, and when it is agreed unto by the Lords, must be
returned back, and be by their Speaker presented, and therefore their Lordships
disclaimed to meddle with Subsidy or Supply, by such beginning in the higher
House, or by naming the number of Subsidies, times of payment, or any such
circumstances incident to a Bill; Yet their Lordships might confer and talk
about Supplies in general, and give their advice therein, that being no whit
derogatory to the Privileges of the House of Commons, their Lordships in all
reason being likelier to communicate in the Councels and secrets of State, as
those that were nearer to the Royal Throne, and having just cause therein to
impart their fears and foresight of dangers to the House of Commons.

That such proceedings of their Lordships, as they were grounded upon just and
weighty reason, so they were agreeable to ancient usage and custom, and were
fully justified by that establishment in Parliament mentioned by the House of
Commons at the last Conference, being made at Gloucester, in the 9. year of
Henry the fourth, and styled not the Indemnity of the Commons (as had been
said) but the Indemnity of Lords and Commons.

And for the other breach of Privilege which had been objected, their
Lordships declared, That his Majesty had told them the House of Commons had
resolved something concerning those three heads, Of Religion, Propriety of
goods, and Privilege of Parliament.

How his Majesty knew of this resolution belonged not to their Lordships to
enquire into, their Lordships not meddling with any thing that others said to
the King, but what the King said to them.

And that their Lordships were so far from holding it any violation of the
Privileges of the House of Commons for their Lordships to hear what the King
declared to them, and for them thereupon to report the same to the House of
Commons, that on the contrary in duty to his Majesty, their Lordships could
do no other; and the communicating of it was an argument of affection and
desire of good correspondence with the House of Commons, and merited no such
misconstruction as had been made of it; neither did that establishment in
Parliament 9. H. 4. contain any words that could be construed to make their
Lordships proceedings in this behalf any breach of the Privileges of the house
of Commons.

Their Lordships proceedings and intentions being thus cleared, the Lord Keeper
by their Lordships command added further, That their Lordships could not but
return to their first grounds and resolutions, which were in all fair and
affectionate manner to stir up in those of the House of Commons the just
consideration of those great and imminent dangers that threatened the Kingdom at
this time, and how dangerous and irrecoverable delay was, and withal to
dispose them to take into their first and best thoughts the matter of his
Majesty's supply, and give him a speedy answer therein.

Which their Lordships were confident would be the means to make this a happy
Parliament, and to avert the public calamities that menaced the ruin and
overthrow of this famous Monarchy.

This having been delivered at that Conference in their Lordships names, was by
his Majesty most graciously interpreted as the noble testimony of their
Lordships affections to his person and government, for which his Majesty by
the Lord Keeper the next day gave their Lordships hearty thanks.

And withal that nothing on his part might be left undone, his Majesty that
morning also being Saturday the second of May, sent a message to the House of
Commons, which was delivered to them in these words;

That his Majesty has diverse times, and by sundry ways acquainted this House
with the urgent necessity of supply, and with the great danger inevitably to
fall upon the whole State, upon his own honor, and the honor of this Nation
if more time shall be lost therein. That nevertheless his Majesty hitherto
has received no answer at all. And therefore considering that as heretofore
his Majesty has told this House, that a delay of his supply is as destructive
as a denial, his Majesty does again desire them to give him a present answer
concerning his Supply, his Majesty being still resolved on his part to make
good whatsoever he has promised by himself or the Lord Keeper.

After which Message delivered unto them, they spent from nine in the morning
till six a clock at night, in many discourses and debates touching their
pretended Grievances, but never came to any resolution what Supply they would
give his Majesty, or whether they would give him any at all, but adjourned the
farther debate till Monday following.

At which time, because his Majesty had understood, the matter of
Shipping-money was that which was most insisted upon, and that the taking away
of that not only for the present but for the future, would be pleasing and
acceptable unto them, his Majesty sent another Message unto them, which was
before they entered into any debate delivered unto them in these words.

Whereas upon Saturday last his Majesty was pleased to send a Message to this
House, desiring you to give a present answer concerning his Supply, to which as
yet his Majesty has had no other, but that upon this day you will take it
into further consideration, Therefore his Majesty the better to facilitate
your resolutions this day, has thought fit to let you know, That of his grace
and favor he is pleased, upon your granting of twelve Subsidies, to be
presently passed, and to be paid in three years, with a Proviso that it shall
not determine the Session, his Majesty will not only for the present forbear
the levying of any Shipping money, but will give way to the utter abolishing of
it by any course that your selves shall like best. And for your Grievances his
Majesty will according to his Royal promise, give you as much time as may be
now, and the rest at Michaelmas next. And his Majesty expects a present and
positive answer upon which he may rely, his affairs being in such condition as
can endure no longer delay.

Notwithstanding this gracious message, and all other his Majesty's former
Desires and Promises, and the Lords earnest persuasions, the House of Commons
spent eight or nine hours more in debating the matter of Supply, without
coming to any resolution at all, and so mixed the consideration of that with
other matters impertinent, and trenching highly to the diminution of his
Majesty's Royal Prerogative, That his Majesty plainly discerned they went
about to weary and tire him with delays, And though in words some did not deny
to supply him, yet in that also most moved to clog the Bill of Subsidies in
such sort, that his Majesty could not have accepted it without great prejudice
to his Prerogative; And they were so far from declaring what they would do,
That they entertained themselves with discourses tending to render odious to
his people that gracious government of his, under which all his people have,
during his happy reign, lived in such peace and felicity, when all the
neighboring Kingdoms and States were in troubles and combustions.

His Majesty was hereupon enforced by the advice of His Privy Council to
resolve to break up and dissolve the Parliament, from which he could hope for
no other fruit then the hindering of His great affairs, and disordering His
happy Government.

And therefore on Tuesday the fifth of May, His Majesty came again in person
to the Lords House, and sending for the Speaker, and the House of Commons, when
they were come up, said thus;

MY LORDS, THere can no occasion of my coming to this House be so unpleasing
to me, as this is, at this time: The fear of doing that, which I am to do this
day, made me not long ago come to this House, where I expressed, as well my
Fears, as the Remedies I thought necessary for the eschewing of it; Unto
which, I must confess, and acknowledge that you, (My Lords of the Higher
House) did give me so vvilling an Ear, and with such affection, did show
your selves thereafter, that certainly, I may say, If there had bin any means
to have given an happy end to this Parliament, you took it; So, that it was
neither your Lordships fault, nor mine, that it is not so: Therefore in the
first place, I must give your Lordships thanks for your good Endeavors.

I hope you remember what my Lord Keeper said to you, the first day of the
Parliament, in my Name; What likewise he said in the Banqueting House in
White Hall, and what I lately said to you in this place my self. I name all
this unto you, not in doubt that you do not well remember it, but to show
you, that I never said any thing, in way of favor to my people, but that by
the grace of God, I will punctually, and really perform it.

I know that they have insisted very much on Grievances, and I will not say,
but that there may be some (though I will confidently affirm, that there are
not by many degrees so many, as the public voice does make them.) Wherefore
I desire you to take notice, now especially at this time, that out of
Parliament, I shall be as ready, (if not more vvilling) to hear, and redress,
any just Grievances, as in Parliament. There is one thing, that is much spoken
of, though not so much insisted on as others, and that is Religion; Concerning
which, albeit I expressed my self fully the last day in this place to your
Lordships, yet, I think it fit again, on this occasion, to tell you, that, (as
I am most concerned, so) I shall be most careful, to preserve, that purity of
Religion, which, I thank God, is so well established in the Church of England,
and that, as well out, as in Parliament.

My Lords, I shall not trouble you long with words, it being not my fashion;
wherefore to conclude, what I offered, the last day, to the House of Commons,
I think is well known to you all, as likewise how they accepted it, which I
desire not to remember, but vvish that they had remembered, how, at first, they
were told, in my Name, by my Lord Keeper, That delay was the vvorst kind of
denial; yet I will not lay this fault on the whole House (for I will not
judge so uncharitably of those, who, for the most part, I take to be Loyal,
and vvell-affected Subjects) but, that it has been the malicious cunning, of
some fevv sediciously-affected men, that has been the cause of this
misunderstanding.

I shall now end, as I began, in giving your Lordships thanks, for your
affection shevvn to me at this time; desiring you, to go on to assist me, in
the maintaining of that Regal power, that is truly mine, and, as for the
Liberty of the people, that they now so much seem to startle at; Know, (my
Lords) that no King in the world shall be more careful to maintain them in,
The property of their Goods, Liberty of their Persons, and true Religion,
then I shall be.

And now, my Lord Keeper, do what I have commanded you.

Then the Lord Keeper added.

MY Lords, and you Gentlemen of the House of Commons, The Kings Majesty does
dissolve this Parliament.

BY all the proceedings herein declared, it is evident to all men, how willing
and desirous his Majesty has been to make use of the ancient and Noble way of
Parliament, used and instituted by his Royal Predecessors, for the
preservation and honor of this famous Monarchy; and that on his Majesty's
part, nothing was wanting that could be expected from a King, whereby this
Parliament might have had an happy conclusion, for the comfort and content of
all his Majesty's Subjects, and for the good and safety of this Kingdom. On
the contrary, it is apparent how those of the House of Commons (whose sinister
and malicious courses enforced his Majesty to dissolve this Parliament) have
vitiated and abused that ancient and Noble way of Parliament, perverting the
same to their own unworthy ends, and forgetting the true use and institution of
Parliaments. For whereas these meetings and assemblies of his Majesty with the
Peers and Commons of this Realm, were in their first original, and in the
practice of all succeeding ages, ordained and held as Pledges and Testimonies
of affection between the King and his People, the King for his part graciously
hearing and redressing such Grievances as his People in humble and dutiful
manner should represent unto him, and the Subjects on their part, as
Testimonies of their duty, supplying his Majesty upon all extraordinary
occasions, for the support of his Honor and Soveraigntie, and for preserving
the Kingdom in glory and safety; Those ill-affected members of the House of
Commons, in stead of an humble and dutiful way of presenting their Grievances
to his Majesty, have taken upon them, to be the Guiders and Directors, in all
matters that concern his Majesty's Government both Temporal and
Ecclesiastical, and (as if Kings were bound to give an account of their Regal
actions, and of their manner of Government, to their Subjects assembled in
Parliament) they have in a very audacious and insolent way entered into
examination and censuring of the present Government, traduced his Majesty's
administration of Justice, rendered (as much as in them lay) odious to the rest
of his Majesty's Subjects, not only the Officers and Ministers of State, but
even his Majesty's very Government; which has been so just and gracious, that
never did this or any other Nation enjoy more blessings and happiness, then
has been by all his Majesty's Subjects enjoyed ever since his Majesty's
access to the Crown, nor did this Kingdom ever so flourish in Trade and
Commerce, as at this present, or partake of more peace and plenty in all
kinds whatsoever.

And whereas the ordinary Revenues of the Crown not sufficing to defray
extraordinary charges, it has ever been the usage in all Parliaments to aid
and assist the Kings of this Realm with free and fitting Supply toward the
maintenance of their Wars and for making good their Royal undertakings,
whereby the Kingdom entrusted to their protection, might be held up in
splendour and greatness, Those ill-affected persons of the House of Commons have
been so far from treading in the steps of their Ancestors, by their dutiful
expressions in this kind, that contrarily they have introduced a way of
bargaining and contracting with the King, as if nothing ought to be given him
by them, but what he should buy and purchase of them, either by quitting
somewhat of his Royal Prerogative, or by diminishing and lessening his
Revenues. Which courses of theirs, how repugnant they are to the duty of
Subjects, how unfit for his Majesty in Honor to permit and suffer, and what
hazard and dishonor they subject this Kingdom to, all men may easily judge,
that will but equally and impartially weigh them.

His Majesty has been by this means reduced to such straights and
extremities, that were not his care of the public good and safety the
greater, these men (as much as in them lies) would quickly bring ruin and
confusion to the State, and render contemptible this glorious Monarchy.

But this frowardness and undutifull behavior of theirs, cannot lessen his
Majesty's care of preserving the Kingdoms entrusted to his Protection and
Government, nor his gracious and tender affection to his people; for whose good
and comfort his Majesty by Gods gracious assistance will so provide, that all
his loving Subjects may still enjoy the happiness of living under the blessed
shade and protection of his Royal Scepter.

In the mean time, to the end all his Majesty's loving Subjects may know, how
graciously his Majesty is inclined to hear and redress all the just
Grievances of his people, as well out of Parliament as in Parliament, his
Majesty does hereby further declare his Royal will and pleasure, that all his
loving Subjects, who have any just Cause to present, or complain of any
Grievances or oppressions, may freely address themselves, by their humble
Petitions to his Sacred Majesty, who will graciously hear their complaints,
and give such fitting redress therein, that all his people shall have just
cause to acknowledge his grace and goodness toward them, and to be fully
satisfied, that no persons or assemblies can more prevail with his Majesty,
then the Piety and Justice of his own Royal nature, and the tender affection
he does and shall ever bear to all his people and loving Subjects.
