By the King.

A Proclamation restrayning the carrying of munition to Algeeres and Tunis.
THE Kings most Excellent Majesty taking knowledge, as well by the
aduertisements of diverse foreign Princes and States, and of their
Ambassadors, as by the woeful complaints of many of his own good Subjects,
that sustain great and continual losses by Pirates, and Sea-Rouers usually
retiring to, and harboring themselves at Algeers, and Tunis, That the said
Pirates and Sea-Rouers receive great comfort and encouragement by an abusiue
Trade that some Merchants out of greediness, and for unjust lucre do maintain
at Algeers, and Tunis, for weapons, Gunpowder, shot, and other munition of all
sorts, wherewith those common enemies of mankind do daily invade the Subjects
of His Majesty and other Christian Princes, Has thought it agreeable to His
own Justice and Honor to forewarne, that none of His Subjects, from
henceforth, have any hand in a course so unjust.

And therefore His Majesty does hereby straitely charge and command, That
none of His Majesty's Subjects whatsoever, do at any time hereafter carry or
import unto the said Town or Port of Algeers, and Tunis, any Gunpowder, shot,
armor, weapons, munition or victualles whatsoever upon pain to incur His
Majesty's indignation and highest displeasure, and to endure the seuerest
chastisements that so high an offense may deserve to be inflicted on them by
His Majesty's Laws or Kingly Prerogative.

Given at the Court at White Hall, the sixth day of April, in the one and
twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXIII.
