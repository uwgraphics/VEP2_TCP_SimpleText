By the Queen.
WHereas the Earl of Essex, accompanied with the Earls of Rutland and
Southampton, and diverse other their accomplices, Gentlemen of birth and quality,
knowing themselves to be discovered in diverse treasonable actions, into which
they have heretofore entered, as well in our Realm of Ireland, where some of
them had laid plots with the Traitor Tirone, as in this our Realm of
England, did upon Sunday, being the eight of this Month, in the morning, not
only imprison our Keeper of our Great Seal of England, our Chief Justice of
England, and others both of our Nobility and Council, that were sent in our
Name to his house, to persuade the said Earl to lay open any his petitions or
complaints, with promise if he would disperse his disordered company in his
house) that all his just requests should be heard, and graciously considered:
but also did (after strait order given by him to murder our said Counselors
and others, whenever they should offer to stir out of that place)
traitourously issue into our City of London in arms, with great numbers, and
there breaking out into open action of rebellion, devised and diuulged base and
foolish lies, That their lives were sought, spreading out diverse strange and
seditious inventions, to have drawn our people to their party, with purpose
to attempt traitourous actions, both against our Person and State, and to
expose as it now appears) our City and people with their goods to the spoil
of a number of needy and desperate persons their adherents, continuing still in
arms, and killing diverse of our Subjects, after many Proclamations of
rebellion made by our King of Heralds:

Forasmuch as notwithstanding (God be thanked) they have found themselves
deceived of their expectation (being now all apprehended, and within our Tower
of London, as well the three principal Traitorous Earls, of Essex, Rutland,
and Southampton, as diverse others of the principal Gentlemen their confederats)
our good Subjects of our City, and elsewhere, having showed themselves so
constant, and vmnoueable from their duties toward us, as not any one of them
of any note (that we can yet hear of) did offer to assist the said Earl and
his associats; We have been contented, in regard of the comfort that we take
to find by so notorious evidence, the loyal disposition of our people
(whereof we never doubted) not only to make known to all our said Subjects of
our City and elsewhere, in how thankful part we do accept both their
loyal persisting in their duty, and stay from following the false
persuasions of the Traitors, but to promise on our part, That whenever we
shall have to show it, they shall find us more careful over them, then for
our selves, And hereby also in regard of our gracious meaning toward our good
people, to admonish them, That seeing this open Act was so sudden, as it
cannot yet be thoroughly looked into, how far it stretched, and how many
hearts it has corrupted, but that it is to be presumed by the common example
of the manner of proceeding of all Rebels in like actions, that it was not
without instruments and ministers dispersed in diverse places, to provoke the
minds of our people, to like of their attempts, with calumniating our
government, and our principal Servants and ministers thereof; That they shall
do well (and so we charge them) to give diligent heed in all places, to the
conversation of persons not well known for their good behavior, and to the
speeches of any that shall give out slanderous and undutiful words or
rumors against us and our government: And they that be in authority, to lay
hold on such Spreaders of rumors, And such as be not in authority, to
advertise those thereof that have authority, to the end that by the
apprehension of such dangerous instruments, both the drift and purpose of evil
minded persons may be discovered, their desseignes prevented, and our people
conserved in such peace and tranquillity, as heretofore by Gods favor, we
have maintained, and do hope still to continue amongst them.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the ninth day of February 1600, in the
three and fortieth year of our reign.
Imprinted at London by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Queens most excellent
Majesty. 1600.
