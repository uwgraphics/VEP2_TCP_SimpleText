Andrews Golden Chain, TO Link the penitent sinner unto Almighty God. Richly
adorned with the ornaments of holy Scripture, which was never in print, nor
from any man elsewhere to be had. Newly made in a godly Prayer, taken out of
the pure fountain of holy Scripture, very necessary to cure the sick soul of
a sinner: and to draw him from desperation if with a believing faith he will
daily use it, in prayer unto Almighty God.

London printed for John Wright at the sign of the Bible without Newgate. 1645.

RIght Honorable, for Gods sake, your own sake, and yours souls sake, peruse
this little Book over, for it guides you in the direct way unto Almighty God,
and shows you how to give your heart unto God, and your sins unto Satan,
every time you pray with this Prayer.

sins, do seem so grim and ugly in my sight, so base and loathsome unto my
mind, and so venomous unto my body, and soul, that, O Lord my God, the very
stincke thereof makes me weary of all my sins, and utterly abhor and
detest them.

And therefore my life 1 Cor. 1. 7.

Cross, and bury them in thy grave that they may never rise up in judgment

Now what shall I render unto thee, O my sweet and loving Savior o, for all
that thou have done for me: Sacrifices and burnt offerings thou will not have,
but a contrite and broken heart, O Lord, thou have promised not to despise
Psalm. 51. 16, 17. Ioh. 14. 9. 2 Samuel 22. 29. 1 Cor. 1. 30. Tit. 3. 5, 6, 7. Wis

Wherefore in token of my humblest devotion I owe unto thy most sacred self,
with all humility I will give my dearest love unto thee my sweet Jesus Wis. 6.
21. Psalm. 65. 9. Exodus 15. 2.
, which art my light Ioh. 8. 22. 2 Samuel 22. 3
, my way Ioh. 14. 6.

Genesis 1. 26.
, that made and redeemed it Ephesians. 1. 7. Ioh. 14. 6. 1 Ioh. 1. 23. Col. 3. 3.
? for it can find no rest until it come unto thee, to be refreshed with the
sweet sight of thy cheerful countenance Psalm. 27. 4. Luke 2. 11.
: wherefore my comfort 1 Cor. 1. 3. 2 Samuel 22. 3.
, my Redeemer Ioh. 11. 25. Mat. 1. 21.
, my life Act. 5. 31. Psalm. 18. 1.
, and only Savior Tim. 4. 10.
, with all humility I prostrate my self before thy Majesty, most humbly
beseeching thee to take it, oh take it, for it is thine, O Lord my God Psalm.
30. 2. Psalm. 7. 12. 1 Kin. 17. 20. 21. Psalm 109. 25. Psalm. 18. 1.
, it is thine.

Thou sufferedst thine own heart to be pierced for it I^h 19. 34. Psalm. 40. 6.

11. Ephesians 1 17.
, and did but lend it me during thy pleasure, and should I then detain it
from thee that have so dearly bought it? oh no, no, I will reserve it only
for thee.

To whom fitter may I bequeath my heart, then unto thee my sweet and loving
Savior Wis. 16. 21. Wis. 2. 23. Col. ^. 10.
, which have given thy self a ransom for it 1 Col. 1. 30. Eccles. 17. 1. Tit.
3 5, 6, 7. Ephesians. 1. 7.
?

Wherefore go thou O my heart, I have given thee unto God my Maker Genesis 1. 21.
, and Redeemer 1 Cor. 1. 30. Col. 3. 10. 7. 1.
, he created thee Eccles. 1. Genesis 1. 27. Tit. 3. 6. Wis. 23.
and he only shall have thee: Now thou art in Gods keeping, thou may quietly
pass through the gates of death, there is neither disquieting with sorrow for
sin, nor with sin, which is beyond all sorrow; thou art there without the
reach of thine adversary.

Whilst thou wast mine, thou wast a wandering, faithless, secure, carnal, and
impenitent heart, (always infected with the poison of sin,) but being now thy
Creators, he will apparel thee anew, adorning thee with the gifts of his
Spirit, that being here clothed with the ornaments of his grace, thou may be
transplanted unto the Kingdom of glory, Unto the which place, the Lord of his
mercy bring me, through the mirits of his Son, my Lord and Savior Jesus
Christ: To whom with the Father and the holy Ghost, he rendered all honor and
glory, power and praise, might, Majesty, dignity, and dominion, both now and
evermore, Amen.

In this prayer I do from the bottom of my heart, with all humility confess
my sins unto my Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, most entirely desiring him in
his mercy, to give me his grace to return unto him by speedy repentance.
O Jesus Christ my sweet Savior, thou Son of God, which art most holy and
most merciful, have mercy on me O Lord, for pity hear my prayers, and grant
me petitions: I am a miserable and most wretched sinner, which from the crown
of mine head unto the sole of my foot, have no soundness in me, but wounds,
blaines, and putrefying sores of sin, which deserve thy wrath and indignation
against me: but sweet Lord, have compassion upon me, and anoint my wounds with
thine oil of mercy. O Lord, I come with a mourning heart, and weeping eyes,
with my most earnest repentance, Oh reconcile my poor, wounded, and distressed
soul slain with sin, unto thee, O Lord my God, upon the multitude of thy
mercies, and with a contrite heart, with all humility, even with sighs,
groans, and tears, most lamentably bewail my sins, and openly confess them
unto thee O sweet Jesus to be more in number then the hairs of mine head, or
sands in the Sea. Yet O my most merciful Savior, I beseech thee forgive me, O
Lord forgive me, and give me grace to return unto thee by speedy repentance,
which God grant me.

FINIS.
