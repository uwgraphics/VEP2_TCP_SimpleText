How the land of England was first named Albion / And by what encheson it was
so named
In the noble land of Sirrie / there was a noble king and mighty and a man of
great reno^me / that me callid Dioclisian, that well and worthily him governed
and ruled through his noble chyualrye / so that he co^querd all the lands about
him / so that almost all the kings of the world to him were entendant / Hit
befell thus that this dyoclisian spoused a gentil damisel / that was wonder fair
that was his emes daughter labana / and she loved him as reason would / so that
he gate upon her xxxiij daughters / of the which the eldest me callid Albyne /
and these damisels when they come unto age bicome so fair that it was wonder /
wherefore that this dyoclisia^ anon let make a somenyng / and commanded by his
lre^s / that all the kings that helden of him should come at a certain day. as
in his lre^s we re contained to make a ryal feste / At which day thider they
comen / and brought with hem amyrals princes and dukes, and noble chiualrye /
The feste was ryally awayed / and there they lived in joy and myrthe enough,
that it was wonder to wit / And it befell thus that this dyoclisian thought to
marye his daughters among all tho kings that tho were at that sole^pnyte /
and so they spaken and did that albyne his eldest daughter / and al her
sustres richely were married unto xxxiij kings / that were lords of greece
honor and of power at this solempnyte / And when the solempnite was done,
every king took his wife and lad hem in to her own country / and there made
hem queen's / And it befell thus afterward / that this dame Albyne bycome so
stout and so stern / that she told little prys of her lord / and of him had
scorn and despyte / and would not done his will / but she would have her own
will in diverse matters / and all her other sustres euerychone bear hem so evil
against her lords that it was wonder to wit / and for as much as hem thought
that her husbondes were naught of so hye parage comen as her fader / But tho
kings that were her lords would have chastysed hem with fair speech and
behestes, and also by yeftes / and warned hem in fair manner upon al love and
friendship that they should amend her lither conditions / but al was for naught
/ for they dyden her own will in all thing / that hem lyked. and had of power
/ wherefore tho / xxxiij / kings upon a time and oftymes beten their wynes for
they wend that they would have amended her tatches / and her wicked thewes /
but of such conditions they were / that for fair speech and warning, they
dydden all the wers / and for setynges ^ones much wers / wherefore the king that
had wedded albyne wrote the tatches and conditions of his wife albyn and the
letter sent to dioclisian her fader, And when the other kings herd that
albynes lord had sent a letter to dyoclisian / anon they sent lre^s ensealed
with her seals the conditions / and the tatches of her wives. When the king
dyoclisian saw and herd so many playntes of his daughters / he was soore
ashamed / and byoome wonder angry and wroth toward his daughters / and thought
both night and day if he might tho amend it / that they so mysdid / and anon
sent his letters unto the xxxiij kings / that they should come to him / and
bring with hem her wives euerychone at a certain day / for he would there
chastyse them of their wyckednes / if he might in any manner wise / so that the
kings comen al at that day and time that tho was set bitwene hem and the
king. Dioclisian hem vnderfeng with much honor and made a solemn fest to all that were un der his lorship / and the thyrdde day. after this solempnyte. the
king Dioclisian sent after his xxxiij daughters that they should come and speak
with him in his chamber / and when they were come / he spa^ unto hem of their
wykkednesse and of her cruelte and despitously hem reproved and vnderna^ / and
to them he said / if they would not be chasty sed / they should his love lose for
evermore / and when the ladies herd all thie they bycomen abashed and gretely
ashamed. and to her fader they said that they would make al amends / and so
they departed out from her faders chamber / and dame albyn that was the eldest
suster lad hem al in to her chamber / and tho made wide all that were therein so
that no life was among hem / but she and her sustres y fere / Tho said this
albyne, my fair sistres well we known that the king our fader us has reproved
shamed and despised for enchesen to make us obedye^t unto our husbondes / but
certes that shall I never whiles that I live / sith that I am come of a more
hyer kings blood than mine husbonde is / And when she had thus said all her
sustres said the same / And tho said albyne / full well I wot fair sustres that
our husbondes have pleyned unto our fader upon us / wherefore he has us thus
fowlo reproved and despised / wherefore susters my cou^seyl is that this night
when our husbondes ben a bed / al we with one assent cutten her throtes / and
than we may ben in pees of hem / and better we may do this thing under our
faders power. than else where / And anon all the ladies consented and granted
to this counseyl / And when night was come the lords and ladies went to bed
/ and anon as her lords were in sleep they cut al her husbondes throtes. and
so they slowen hem all when that dioclosyan the king her fader herd of this
thing, he bycome hugely wroth against his daughters / and anon would hem al /
have burnt / but all the barons and lords of firrie cou^seylled not so for to
do such sternesse to his own daughters / but only should wide the land of hem
for evermore / so that they never should come ayene / and so he did / And
dioclisyan that was her fader anon commanded hem to goo in to ship / and
delyuerd to hem vytaylles for half a year / And when this was done / all the
sustren went in to the ship. and sailed forth in the sea / and bytoke all her
friends to appolyn that was her god / And so long they saylled in the sea / til
at last they come and arrived in an isle that was al will dernesse / And when
dame albyne was come to that land / and all her sustres / this albyne went
forth out of the ship / and said to her other sustres / For as much quod she
as I am the ol (...) suster of all this company / and first this land have
taken / and for as much as my name is Albyne / I will that this land be called
albion after mine own name / And anon all her sustres granted to her with a
good will, Tho went out all the sustres of the ship / and token the land
albion as her suster called it / and there they went up and down / and fond
nether man ne woman ne child but wild beestes of diverse kinds / and when her
vytayl les were dyspended and hem failed / they fed hem with herbs and
fruits in season of the year. and so they lived as they best might / and after
that they took Flesh of diverse beestes / and bycame wonder fat / and so they
desired mannys company and mannys kind that hem faylled / and for hete they
woxen wonder coragyous of kind / so that they desired more mannys company than
any other solace or mirth / when the devil that perceived and went by diverse
countries / and took body of the eyr and lykyng natures shad of men / and ^e in
to the land of albion and lay by tho wymmen / and shad tho natures upon hem /
and they conceived. after they brought forth geantz. of the which me called
one Gogmagog. and another laugherigan / and so they were named by diverse /
names / and in this manner they come forth and were borne horrible geants in
albion / and they dwelled in caves and hills at her will / and had the land
of albion as hem liked unto the time that Brute arrived and come to Totnesse /
that was in the isle of albion / and there this brute conquered and discomfyted
these geants above said

(...) ends the prologue of Albion. that tho was an isle and her^eneth now how
brute was gotten / and how he slow first his mother / and afterward his fader /
and how he conquered Albion / that after he named Brytayn after his own name /
that now is called England after the name of Engyst of Saxon

that was called gracian defended the land / Capitulo quinquagesimo primo /
When all this was done, king Gowan that was a sarasyn called his brother elga /
and said to him / that he should goo to conquer the land that all tho fair
maidens were in borne, And he ordained tho a great power of ^ehytes of denmark
/ of or koney, and of norwey. And they come in to this land / and brent tou nes
/ and slew folk / and cast a down chirches / and houses and rest gyon / and
robbed the land in length and bread / and put to death all that would not
forsake the right believe and cristendome / for as much as there was no
sonerayne that might hem help, For the king Maximian had taken with him all
the worthy men he went to co^ quere little britain / And in the same time /
that ye here now ^lle was saint albone martred through the wode tyrant
dyoc^sian in the same place / where is now an Abbaye made of saint Albone /
whiles that he was a paynym, But he converted him to God, through the
predicacion of a clerk and a wise man / that was called An^l / that was lodged
a night in his house, And this was after the Incarnacion of Ihu criste cc xxvj
year / And men sh^e understand that saint albone suffered his martirdeme before
that saint edmond was martryd / And her for saint Albone is called the first
martyr of england / this Gowanes brother and hye (...) that were sarasyns went
thurghoute the land / and destroyed all thing that they found / and no thing
they ne spared / When this tydyng came to Rome / how that king gowan had bygonne
for to destroy this land / the Emperor and they of Rome sent a strong man
and of great power that was called gracian with xx^ij M men well fyghtyng for to
cast out sarasenes out of this land / and al they arrived at portesmouth /
Maximian might not come him self / for as much as he was chosen Emperor
after the death of Constantin that was saint eleynes sone. When this gracian ^e
arrived with his host / he let espy privily / where the king go wan might be
found / and he come upon him suddenly as they say in her beds / and
discomfyted him / and sle we hem in her beddes^ uerychone / that none of hem
escaped sauf Gowan that fled with much sorrow in to his country / Sone after
it befell that maximian was slain at Rome through treson / And when gracian wist
that tydyng he let croune him king of this land.

How gracian made him king. when maximian was slain and afterward the britons
slew him for his wykkednes / Ca lij
THis gracian when he bygan to regne / he bycome so wys^sted and so stern and
so much sorrow did to the britons that they slow him among hem / Tho the
king Gowan had understand that Gracian was slain and done to death / he
assembled a great power and come ayene in to this land / and if he had erst
done harm / tho did he much more / for tho he destroyed all this land / and
the christian people that was in much britayn / so that no man was so bardye for
to name god / And he that so did anon he was put to strong death / But the
bishop of london that was tho that was callid gosselyn escaped / and went thens
to them of Rome to seche socoure to help destroy the sarazenes that had
destroyed this land / And the To mayns said that they had be so often a^noyed
for her sendyng after folk in to britayne all for to help the brytons, and
they would no more so done / And so the bishop gosselyn went thens without any
socour or help / And tho went he to the king of little britain that was called
Aldroye. and this was the third king after Gowan merydoc / as before is said /
The bishop prayed this king Aldroye of help and socour / The king had great
pity in his heart when he had herd how the bishop fled / and how the Christian
men were slain in great britayne through paynyms and sarazenes. he granted him
Constantin his brother him for to help with power of folk / and hem did array
horse armure and ships and all thing that hem neded to that vyage / And when
al thing was ready / he called the bishop and to him said / I take you here to
help and socoure Constantin my brother upon this covenant that if god give him
grace the paynyms and the sarazenes to shen de and discomfyte / that than ye
make him king / And the Bishop it granted with good will, Constantin and the
bishop took leave of the king Aldroye / and betoke him to god. and took her
men xij M and went to her ships / and sailed toward great Britayne and
arrived at Cotnesse / When the britons herd the tidings / that to hem come
socour / they were strongly helped. and ordained hem an huge nombre of people
and come to hem / and under feng hem with much honor, Gowan anon as he wist of
thise things he assembled all the sarazenes and come against hem / and yaf hem
battle, and Constantin slow him with his own hondes. And all tho other
sarasyns were discomfyted and slain, that none escaped but tho that were
converted unto god.

chamber of tho men that were within / and there abode no mo but the king and
the pehyte / and made a contenau^ce as though he would have spoke with the king
in his ere / and there he slew him with a long knyf / and after went queyntely
out of the chamber in to another chamber / so at the last no man wist / where
he was bycome / When the kings meyne wist that her lord was so deed / they
made so much sorrow / they nyst al what to done / for as much as his two sons
Aurilambros and ^ter weren so young that none of hem might be king / and the
thyrdde brother was monk at wyn chestre / as is a fore said / But ^ortiger that
was earl of wes^seye thought privily in his heart through queyntyse to be king

his chyef master. and counceyl l^r, and yafe him all his power for to do
ordeyne / and to do as much as to the Royame apperteyned / so that him self no
thing entermelled, but only bare the name of king / when wrtiger saw that he
had all the land in his ward and gouernayl at his own will / he thought a

crouned and made king and regne / and let sen de after an honderd knights of
pehytes the worthyest of all the land / and hem held with him to duelle with
him as to ben kep^rs of his body / as he would wend through the land to ordeyg

great yef^s that he had give largely / they cried through the court that
^ortiger were better worthy to be king than Constance / wherefore ^ortiger made
semblaunt as he had been wroth / and departed thens. fro the court and said he

of ^ortiger that tho was made king / through whom Constau^ce her brother was
slain / wherefore the honderd knights of pehy^s were put to death / and beren all the blame / as that vortiger had not wist there of another there to consented /
And so the kepars of tho two children dred lest Mortiger would put hem to death
through his treason and falsenes / as he had done her brother beforne / And
therefore they were lad over in to lytil Britayne, and the king hem resseyued
with much honor / and leete hem to norysshe / And there they duellyd til they
bycome fair knights / and strong and fires / and thought to be auengyd upon
the death of Constance her brother when they saw her time / and so they did / as
ye shull here tell afterward / Hit was not long after that the tidings ne

dampened and put to death through vortiger in this land therefore they were
wonderly wroth and sworen that they would ben auengyd of her kynnes death / and
comen in to this land with a great power / and robbed in many places / and
slow and did all the sorrow that they might / When Mortiger it wist, he made
much sorrow and was sore annoyed. And in another place also tidings came to
him / that aurilambros and ^ter his brother or deyned and assembled a great
hooste for to come in to much Britaigne / that is to say in to this land to

ANd sone after this sorrow tydynge come to vortiger that a great nauye of
strangers were arrived in the country of kent But he wyste not whens they were,
ne wherefore they were come in to this land / The king sent anon a messager
thither that some of hem should come and speak with him for to wit what folk
they were. and what they axed / and in to what country they would gone / There
were two brethren maystres and princes of that strong company / that one was
called Engyst / and that other horse / Engyst went to the king / and told him

When wrtiger herd this tydyng / he said he would gladly hem with old upon
such cou^nant / if they might deliver his land of his enemies / he would y^ue
hem reasonable lands / where they should duelle for evermore / Engyst thanked him
goodly / and in this manner he and his company with x^ M should dnelle with the
king ^r tiger / and so much they did through her ^oldenesse that they deliuerd
the land clean of his enemies / Tho prayed Engyst the king of so much land /
that he might make to him a Cite for him and for his meyne / The king ansuerd*
it was not for to done without cou^ceyll of his britons / Engyst prayed him
eftsoon of as much place as he might compass with a thong of a skin*
whereupon he might make him a manner / and for him to duelle on / And the king
granted him freely* Tho took engyst a bulle skin and cut^ it as small as he

that was the first time that wassayle and drynk haylle come up in this land /

Of king Aurilambros how he pursued Mortiger and engyst / and how they dyden.
Ca / lxiiij /
OErlyn and his mother departed fro the king / and turned (...) to karmardyne /
And so after tydyng come to the Briton^ that Aurilambros and ^der his brother
were arryned at Totnesse with a great host. and the britone anon assembled
hem. and went to vnderfonge Aurilambros and ^ter with great noblesse, and lad
hem to london / and crouned there aurilambros / and made him king / and dyden
to him homage / And he axed. Where vortigr that was king might be found / for
he would be auengyd of his broders death / and after he would werre upon paynyms
/ And they told him that vortiger was in walys / and so they lad him thiderward
/ vortiger wist well that the brethren come him to conque re / and fled thens
in to a Castle that was called gerneth / that stood upon a high montayne / and
there him held / Aurilambros and ^r his brother and her fol^ had besyeged the
^stel full ^g time, For the castle was strong and well arrayed / So at the last
they cast wyldefyre / And burnt (...) and men and all her arraye / and as
much as was within the castle / So that vortiger was brents among all other /
and so dyed he with much sorrow Tho was Engyst in kent / and reigned there / and
herd this tydyng and anon fled and would have gone in to scotland for to have
had socour. but Aurilambros and his men met with him in the northcou^tre /
and yafe him battle, and engyst and his men hem defended whiles that they
might / but he and his folk were discomfyted / and slain / And Otta his sone
fled unto york. And Aurilambros him followed egrely / Otta a little while against
him stood but afterward he put him to his mercy / And Aurilambros un derfenge
him / and to him and his men he yaf the country of gale weye in Scotland. and
there they duellyd / The king Aurilambros went tho through out the land / and
put awey the name of Engysteland that engist after his name had called it
before / Tho let he it call ageyn great, britayne / and let make ageyn
Chirches howses of reli gyon / Castles Cytes and burghes and Towns that the
saxons had destroyed / and come to london. and let make the walls of the cite
/ which eugist and his folk had cast a down / / The britons led him to the
mount of Anbrian / where sometime was an hows of relygi on, that tho was
destroyed through painyms, whereof a knight was called Anbry / that sometime was
founder of the hows / and therefore the hylle was called the mount of brian / and
after was called Ambresbury and shall for evermore /

How Aurilambros did redress the land of great Britayn that was destroyed
through saxons / Ca, lxv /
HOw the king Aurilambros let amend and redress the house of Amlesbury / and
therm put monks / but now there be nonnes a little from the place / that was
called Salysbury / there tho the saxons slew the britons / where Engyste and he
should have made a love day, in which time there were slain a / M. lxi
knights through treson of engyst / The king thereof had great pity / and thought
to make in mind of him a monument of stone / that might endure to the worlds
end. And of this thing they toste her counceill / what there of was best for to
done. Tho spaste to the king the bishop of london that was called Ternestyn
that he should enquere after merlyn / for he could best tell how this thing
might be made / and merlyn after was sought and solid. and come to the king /
and the king told him his will of the monument that he wol de have made / Tho
ansuerd merlyn to the king and said There ben great stones in Irland and long
upon the hill of kydn that men called geants kawll. and if they were in this
place as they ben there / here they would endure for evermore in remembrance of
tho knights that here ben entered / ^r ma foy quod the king as hard stones be
in my land as in Irland Soth quod Merlyn But in all your land ben none such,
For geanntes set hem for great good of hem self / For at every times that
they were wou^ ded / or in any manner hurt / they wes^hen the stones with hot
water / and then wesshe hem therewith / and anon they were hoole /

How the Britons went for to seche the great stones in Irlond Capitulo / lxvj /
When thise britons had herd of this thing they went and swo re among hem that
they would go seche the stones / and took with hem meet the kings brother to ben
her chyueteyne / and xv. M men / and merlyn counceylled hem for to gone in to
Irland / and so they diden / And when the king of Irlond that was called gui^
somer herd tell that stranngers were arrived in his land / he assembled a
great power / and fought against hem, but he and his folk were discomfyted /
The Britons went before till they come to the mou^te of kylyan and clymed unto
the mount. But when they s^ we the stones and the manner how they stood / they
had great (...) ylle and said bitwene hem / that noman should remeue for no
strength ne engyne / so huge they were and so long / but merlyn through his
^afte and queyntise reineued hem / and brought hem in to her she and come
again in to this land / And merlyn set the stones there that the king would
have hem / and set hem in the same manner / that they stoden in Irlond / and
when the king saw that it was made / he thanked merlyn / and richely him
rewarded at his own will / and that place let call stonhenge for evermore /

How passent that was vortigers son and the king guyllomer come in to this
land / and how a traitor that was called Co^ enpoysoned the king Aurilambros /
Ca / lxvij /
And men shall understand that passent that was mortigers sone lived in the
same time / and come in to this land with a great power / and drryued in the
north country / and would ^n avenged of his faders death Mortiger. And strongly
trusted upon the company that he had brought with him out of the land of
germanye / and had conquered all the north country unto yor^, and when king
Aurilambros herd this / he assem^d a great power of britons / and went for to
befyght him / and (...) his people were discomfyted / but passent escaped thens
with some of his folk / and fled thens in to Irlond / and come to king gui^met
and prayed him of help and socour / The king granted him with good will, and
said / he would help him with good will upon that covenant that I my self
must gone with you with all my power in to Britayne / and I would avenge me
upon the britons rather than they in to my land comen, and token the stones
with strength that called is geau^ts ^ll / the styng guyllomer (...) ordeyne
his ships and went to the sea with xv M men / and arrived in walys / and
bygonne to rob and much sorrow done / hit bfell so that king Aurilambros lay
seek at wynchestre / and might not help him self / So that he sent in his name
(...) his brother with a great power to help walys / and thyderward he went as
much as he might / The king of Irlond and passent had herd tell that
Aurilambros was syke, and to him come a ^seyn that was callid Coppa and said /
Sir quod he / duelle ye here al in pees with your host, and I behote you
through my queyutyse that I shall slay the king aurilambros that is seek / if ye

upon him an abyte of Relygyon / and beat shave him a broad crown / and come
to the kings court / and said that he would hele the king of his ma lady / Tho
said the Traitor Coppa unto the king / Sir ben of good comfert. for I shall
give you such a medyeyne / that ye shall sweten anon right and lusten to sleep
/ and have good rest / and the trai tour yaf him such poison / that he sleep
anon right. and dyed in his slepyng / And the traitor said that he would gone
in to the field till he were awaked / and so escaped he awey / For no man had
to him suspection for encheson of his abyte, that he was in clothed and also
for his broad croune / But when the kings men wyfte that he was deed / they
bycomen wonder sorry / and fast sought the trai tour / But they might not find
him / for Coppa toened again to the host. fro whens that he come /

When Aurilambros was deed a sterre in the morn was seyne with a clear light /
and at the bought of the beme was fey^ the (...) of an horrible dragon / Ca /

When the king Aurilambros was thus deed and enpoysened at wynches^e / a morn
after that he was deed about the time of p^e there was seyne a ^rre greet and
clear / and the beme of that sterre was bryghter than the son / and at the
bout of the beme appeared a drago^s head, and out of his mouth come ij huge
lights that were as bright, as any fire brennyng / and that one beme went
toward France / and straught over the sea thyderward And out of that beme come
vij bemes full clear and long as it we to the light of fire / This sterre was
feyn of many a man / but none of hem wist what it bytokened / mere that was the
kings brother that was in walis with his host of bertons saw that sterre and
the great light that yafe he wondered thereof gretely what it might bytoken / and
let call merlyn / and prayed him for to tell / what it might bytoken.

Of the betokenyng of the sterre / Ca / lxix /
OErlyn saw that sterre and beheld him long time and sythen^s he quoke and
wept tenderly, and said allas allas that so no ble king and worthy is deed.
And I do you to understand that Anrilambros your brother is enpoysened / and
that I see w^ in this sterre and your self bytokened by the head of the dragon
that is seyn at the bought of the beme that is your self that shall be king and

took his men and went toward his enemy. and they foughten to geder mortaly /
and so be discomfyted his enemies all / and destroyed / and him self show

Of Vter pendragon / and wherefore he was called so after ye shall here / And
how he was overtake with great love of Igerne that that was therle of
Cornewaylles wife / Ca. lxx /
AFter the death of Aurilambros Vter his brother was crowned and reigned well and
worthily, and in remembrance of the dragon that he was lyked to / he let make
two / dragones through cou^seill of his britons / that one to be bow before him
/ when he went in to bataylle, and that other to abide at wynchestre in the
bisshops church / And for that encheson he was called ever after Vter
pendragon / And Otta that was Engystes sone / commended but little Vter / that
was made new king and ageynste him bygan to meue war / and ordained a great
company of his friends and of his kynne and of Ossa his brother / and had take
all the land from humber unto york / but they of york held strongly ageyn hem /
and would not suffer hem to come in to the town, another to yield the Cite to hem

as well as they might / but at last they were discomfyted / and the moose part
of hem slain / and otta and ossa were taken and put in to prison at london /
And Vter him self duellyd a while at york / and after he went to london / and
at the ester after suyng he would bear crown / and hold a solemn fest, and
let sompne al his earls and barons that they should come to that fest / and all

Cornewayle / and Igerne his wife setten al there next the king / and the king
saw the fayrenes of that lady that she had And was rauysshed for her beauty /
and often he made to her nyce semblaunt in lokyng and laughyng / so at the last
the earl perteyned the prive lokyng and laughyng and the love bitwene hem and
aroos (...) from the table all in wrath / and took his wife and called to him
his knights / and went thens al in wrath without taking leave of the king / The
king anon sent after him that he should come ageyn and go not thens in despite
of him, And therle would not come ayene in no manner wise / wherefore the king was
full wroth, and in wrath him deffyed as his dedely enemy / And the earl went
thens in to Cornewayle with his wife in to the castle of Tyntagell / And the
king let ordeyne a great host and come in to Cornewayl for to destroy the
earl if he might / But he had put him in such a castle that was strong and well
arrayed of Tyntagel / and would not yield him to the king / The king anon
besieged the castle and there duellyd xv days / that never might speed. and
ever thought upon ygerne / and upon her laid so much love / that he no wise

that was pryue with him / and told him al his counseyll and axed of him what
was best for to done / Sir ^d he. does send after Merlyn for he can tell you
the best counceylle of any man living. Merlyn anon was sent after / and come

likeness of therle / and vlfyn garsoys his cha^b^rlayn and to the figure of
Jordan that was therles chamberlayn So that each of hem was transfigured to
other lykenes / And when merlyn had so done. he said to the king / Sir ^d be
now mow ye gone suddenly to the castle of Tyntagel / and axen (...) ^er and

discomfyted and fled unto york / and took the town. and there he held him /
And the king besyeged that town / but he might nothing speed / for the town
was so strong^. and they within kept the town well and orpedly / and in the
mean time Colgryne let the town to bladulf and fled him self to cheldri^ that
was king of Almayn for to have of him socour / and the king assembled a great
power, and come and arrived in scotland with (...) ships / and when Arthur
wist of this tydyng that he he had not power and strength ynouw for to fight
against cheldri^, he let ^en the siege / and went to london / and sent anon
his lettres to the king of (...) britayn that was callid ^oel his neuew his

seyn such a slaughter / And cheldryk. and his men that were leften alive
fledden aweye. And Arthur hem ponrsued / and drofe hem in to a wode / that they
might no ferther pass / cheldrik and his men saw well that they were brought
in so much dysese and hem yolden to Arthur in this manner / that he should take

good hostages. and Arthur by cou^ceylle of his men granted this thing / and
resseyued the hostages / And herupon the other went to her ships / And when
they were in the high see / her will changed as the devil it would, and they
returned her nauye and come again in to this land / and arrived at
tottenesse and went out of her ships / and took the land and clean robbed it,
and much people slew and token all the armure that they might find and so they
went forth til they come to bathe / But the men of the town shit fast her

his people and him self went to help reskew the town of bathe. and when he
come thither / he yafe a strong battle to cheldryk / and slew al most all the
people that he had / for no man might him withstond / ne endure the stroke of
his suerde. And there both were slain Colgryne and (...) his brother / And
cheldrik fled thens and would have go ne to his ships* but when Artur it
wist / he took x M knights to Cador that was earl of Cornewayle for to let

For messagers told him that the scotts had besyeged hoel of bri tayne. there
that he lay seek / and therefore he hasted thyderward / And Cador pursued after
Cheldryk / and took him er he might come to his ships. and slew Cheldryk,
and his people / And when Cador had done this vyage / he hasted him again as
fast as he might toward Arthur / and fond him in scotland there that he had
re seued hoel of britayn / But the scotts were al far within mon ref / And
there they held hem a while / but Arthur hem pursued and they fled thens in to
lymoygne that were in that country ^x Isles / and great plente of briddes / and

And therewith they charged again the folk in to scotland for to wend

How king Arthur axed of Merlyn the auentures of six the last kyn^ges that
weren to regne in england / and how the land should end / Ca / lxxv /
SIr quoth merlyn in the year of yncarnacion of Ihesu criste / M, CC, xv, shall
come a lamb out of wynchestre / that shall ha ue a white tongue and true
lyppes / and he shall have written in his heart holiness / This lamb should make
many gods houses / and he shall have pees the most part of al his life / And
he shall make one of the fairest places of the world that in this time shall
not fully be made an end / And in the end of his life a wolf of a strange
land shall do him much harm and sorrow through werre / but at the end the lamb
shall be master through help of a read fox that shall come out of the northwest
/ and him shall overcome. and the wolf shall dye in water / and after that time
the lamb shall live no while that he ne shall dye, His feed than shall ben in a
strange land / and the land shall be without a governor a little while /

ANd after his time shall come a dragon melled with mercy and este with wodenes
that shall have a berd as a goot that shall give in England shadow. And
shall keep the land from cold and hete / and his own foot shall be fet^ in
wy^e / and that other in london, and he shall enbrace inhabytacions, and he shall
open his mouth toward walys and the trembling of the hydour of his mouth his
eres shall stretche toward many habit^u^s and countries / and his breath shall be
full sweet in strange land / And in his time shall the Ryuers run with blood.
and with brain / and he shall make in places of his land walls that shull do
much harm unto his se ed after his time. Than shall there come a people out of
the northwest during his regne that shall be ladde through out a wykked hare that
the dragon shall done croune king that afterward shall flee over the sea without
coming again for dread of the dragon And in that time the son shall be as
read as blood / as me shull see through all the world / that shall bytoken great
pestyle nee and death of folk through dent of swerd / and that people shall ben
faderles til the time that the dragon shall dye through an hare / that shall meue
against him werre unto the end of his life that shall not fully ben ended in his
time / This dragon shall be hold in his time the best body of the world / and he
shall dye beside the marches of a strau^ ge land / and the land shall duelle
faderles without a good gouer nour / and me shall weep for his death from the
isle of shepey unto the haven of marcyll / wherefore allas shall be the commune
song of faderles folk / that shall ouerlyuen in his land destroyed /

ANd after this dragon shall come a goot out of kar that shall have horns and a
berde of silver / and there shall come out of his nostrel a domp that shall
betoken honger and sorrow and greet death of the people and much of his land in
the beginning of his regne shall be wasted / This goot shall goo over to France,
and shall opene the flout of his life and of death / In his time there shall arryse
an egle in Cornewayle that shall have feathers of gold that of pride shall be
without pere of the la^d and he shall despise lords of blood / and after he
shall flee shamefully by a bear at Gauerseche / and after shul be made bridges
of men upon the costs of the sea / and stones shall fall fro castles (...)
many other towns shul be made plain.

In his time shall seem that the bear shall brenne / and a bataylle shall be done
upon the arms of the sea in a feld ordained as a s^de. And at that bataylle.
shall dye many white heedes / wherefore his bataylle shall be called the white
bataylle /

And the foresaid bear shall done this got much harm. and it shall come out of
the southwest and of his blood / than shall the got ^se much of this land til
at the time that shendship shall him overcome, and than he shall clothe him in a
lion skin, and than shall he win that he had lost / and more thereto / For
a people shall come out of the northwest / that shall make the goot sore adrad /
and he shall avenge him of his enemies through counceyl of two owls that first
shall be in peril for to been undone, but the old oule shall wend a
certain time / and after he shall come again in to this land These two owls
shullen done great harm to many on and so they shall eoun^eylle the got that
he should arere werre against the for said bear / and at the last the goot and
the owls shall come at bur ton up Trent / and shall wend over / and for dread

us of our misdeeds / Since that he does us without bataylle or strength of our
enemies by great companyes wretchedly to leave our own realm and propre land /
Turn again ye Romans / turn again ye scotts / Turn again ye Saxons /

that they might / and much people sprung and come of hem

the mortalyte and pestylence was over passed / and that the land was
replenysshed of Alyene people / he thought to turn again in to his own land
/ And prayed king Aleine his cosyn of socour and help that he might be
restored in to his pro pre realm / and first dygnyte / And king Aleyne
granted him his prayer / Than did he apparayllen him to take his weye / and
vyage in to this land. and prayed god Almighty devoutly that he would make to

thus devoutly ma de his prayer. a voys fro heaven to him said / ^and bad him
leave that Journey awey in to england / and that he go to the pope of To me /
For it was not the will of almighty god that britons regne no more in Britayne /
ne never recover the land un to the time that the prophecye that merlyn said

that the relyques of his body shall be brought fro Rome / and translated in
britayn / and when the relyques of other saints that have been hyd for the per
secucion of the paynym folk / shall be founden / and openly showed / than shall
they recover her land again / which they have so long time lost through her
deserts / When Cadwaladre had herd this ansuere / he merueyled gretely / and
told it to king Aleyne / Than king aleyne did send for the clergy of his land
/ and made hem to bring the stories and prophecyes that merlyn and sibi^ had
said in her prophecyes / and when he knew that the prophecye that festome had
prophesied of the egle / and other prophecyes acorded to the dyuyne ansuere /
that Cadwaladre had herd / he cou^ceilled him to leave his people and his nauye /
and submytte him to the disposiaon of god / and done all that the angel had

words / and sweet and was an holy man and of good conscience / And merlyn
said that this henry should make the fairest place of all the world that in his

the Abbeye of saint Peter's Church at westmynster / that is fayrer of sight
than any other church / that men know through al Crystendom / but king henry
dyed er that work were fully made / and that was great harm, And yet said
Merlyn that this lamb should have pees the most time of his regne / and he
said full sothe. for he was never annoyed through werre ne dyseased in no manner

and in the regne, and end of the foresaid lamb a wolf of a strange land /
should done him great harm through his werre / and that he should at last ben

the foresaid Simond was shent / and that was great harm to the communes of
England that so good a man was shent for troth / and dyed in charity, and for
the comune profit of the same folk / and therefore Almighty god for him has
Sythenes showed many a fair miracle to diverse men and women of the sykenesse
and dysesse / that they have had for the love of him

And merlyn also told and said in his Profecye that after that time the lamb
should leave no while / and than his seed should ben in strange land without
pasture^ / And he said sothe. For king henry lived no while after when Symond

and by common assent they should al wend to the castle of dunstanburgh / the

in wrath and drowe his swerd and swore by almighty god, and by his holy names /
but if that he would gone with hem, he should be deed / and that he would slay him
there, The noble and gentil earl Thomas of lancastre was sore adrad and said
fair syrs I will gene with you whyder so ever ye me led / Tho went they to
geders in to the north / and with hem they had seven / C / men of arms and
come to Burbrudge / And when sir Andrewe of herkela that was in the

scotland / herd tell how that thomas of lancaster was dysco^fyted and his
company at Burton upon Trent / (...) ordained him a strong power / and Sir
Symond ward also / that was tho shereue of york / and come and met the barons

Sir thomas of lancastre herd that Sir Andrewe of (...) had brought with him

with him spak / and said to him in this manner / Sire Andrewe quod he ye mow

false counceylle through Sir hugh the spencer the fadre / and Sir Hugh his sone
/ and Sir Johan earl of Arondele. and through Maystyr Robert Baldoke a falls
pilled clerk / that now is in the kings court duellyng / wherefore I pray you
that ye would come with vo with all the power that ye have ordained / and help
to destroy the venym of England / and the traitors that been therein / and we
will give unto you the best part of / v / elrdomes that we have. and hold / and
we will make unto you an oath / that we will never done thing without your
counceyll / and so ye shall ben efte as well with us as ever was Robert of
Holand / Tho ansuerd Sir andrewe of herkela. and said / Sir Thomas that would I
not done ne consent there to for no manner thing / ye might me give without the
will and commandment of our lord the king / for than should I ben hold a
traitor for evermore / And when the noble Earl tho mas of lancastre saw that
he nold not consent to him for no ma ner thing / Sir Andrew he said / will ye
not consent to destroy the venym of the reame as we be consent / At one word
sir andre we I tell the that or this year be gone / that ye shall ben take and

dye than ever dyed any knight of England / And understands well that ye did
never thing that sorer shall you repent and now goth and does that you good
lyketh / And I will put me unto the mercy / and the grace of god / And so went
the false traitor sir Andrew of herkela in his wey as a falls traitor tirant
and as a falls forsworen man / For through the noble earl Thomas of lancastre he
vnderfenge the arms of Chyualrye / and through him he was made knight.

Tho might men seen archyers draw hem in that one side / and in that other /
and knights also / and foughten to gedre wonder sore / and also among other
Sir humfrey de boughon earl of Herford a worthy knight of renomme through al
cristendom / stood and fought with his enemies upon the bridge. and as the
noble lord stood and fought upon the bridge / a thyef a ribaud skulked under
the bridge / and fiersly with a spear smote the noble knight in to the
foundament / so that his bowels comen out there. Allas the sorrow / For there
was slain the flour of solace and of comfort and also of curtosye / And Sir
Rogyer of Clyfford a noble knight stood ever and fought / and well and nobly him
defended / as a worthy Baron / But at last he was sore wounded in his head /
and sir Wylliam of Sustayand / Sir Rogyer of Bernefeld were slain at that
bataylle / When Sire Andrewe of Herkela saw that Sir thomas men lancastre
lassed and slaked / anon he and his company come to the gentil knight Sir
Thomas of lan castre and said / yield the traitor yield the / The G^ntille
Earl ansuerd tho and said / Nay lords Traitors be we none / and to you will
we never us yield while that our lyfes lasten but lever we have to be slain in
our treuth / than yield us to you And sir Andrew again grad upon Sir thomas
company / yollyng as a wode wolf and said yield you traitors taken / yield you
/ and with an high voys said / be the, ware sirs that none of you be hardy upon
life and lymme to mysdone thomas body of lancastre And with that word the good
earl thomas went in to the chapel / and said knelyng upon his knes / and turned
his vysage to wards the Cross. and said Almighty god to the I me yield / I
holych put me in to thy mercy / And with that the vileyns ribaudes lepte about
him on every side as tirants and wode tormentours and dispoylled him of his
armure / and clothed him in a robe of ray, that was of his squyers liuere / and
forth lad him un to york by water / Tho might men see much sorrow and care /
for the gentil knights fledden in every side / and the ribaudes / and the
vyleyns egrely hem discryed / and grad an high yield you traitors yield you /
And when they were y yolde they were robbed / and bound / as thefes / Allas
the shame and despyte / that the gentill order of knyghthode there had at that
battle / and the land tho was without law / For holy church tho had no
more reverence than it had been a bordelhows / and in that batayl was the fadre
against the sone / and the uncle against his neuew, For so much vnkendenesse
was never seyn before in england / as was that time among folk of one nation /
for one kynred had no more pite of that other than an hungary wolf has of a
sheep / and it was no wonder / for the great lords of england were not all of
one nation / but were meddled with other nations / that is for to say / some
britons / some saxons. sum danoys / some Pehytes / some Frensshmen / Some
normans / Some spaynardes / Sum Romans, sum Henaudes / Some Flemmynges /
and of other diverse nations. the which Nations acorded not to the kind blood
of England. And if so great lords had been onlych wedded to Englyssh people
than should pees have been and rest / among hem without any envy /

And at that battle was sir Rogyer clyfford take / Sire Johan mombray / Sir
william Tuchet / Sire william fytz william and many other worthy knights there
were take. at that battle And sir hugh daudele the next day after was taken /
and put in to prison / And should have been done to death / if he had not spoused
the kings nece. that was earl gylleberts suster of Gloucestre, And anon after
was ^r bartho^omewe of badelesme^ taken at stowe park a manner of the bisshops
of lyn^ln that was his ne new / and many other Barons / and (...) / wherefore
was made much sorrow /

When king Edward saw that vytaylles failed him* he was tho wonder sore

Profecye of Merlyn declared of king Edward the son of king edward / Cao. CC

OF this king edward prophesied merlyn and said that there should come a got
out of Carre / that should have horns of sil^ and a berde as white as snow
and a doppe should come out of his nosethillers that should bytoken much ^me
honger and death of the people / and great loss of his land. and the in the
beginning of his regne should be hau^ted much lecherye / He said soth / alls
the time for king Edward that was king edwardes sone was borne at Carnariuan in
wa^s / Forsooth he had horns of silu / and a berd as snow when he was made
prince of walys / to much he yaf him to riotte and to folly / and soth said
merlyn in his propherye that there should come out of his nose a doppe / for in
his time was great hunger among the pour people and strong death am^ the
rich that deide in strange land with much sorrow and in we^e in Scotland and
afterward he lost scotland and gascoyne / and whiles that him (...) was king
there was much lecherye haunted / And also Merlyn told and said that this got
should seche the flour of ly^ and of death And he said soth / for he spoused
Isabel the kings daughter of brud ges / And in his time merlyn said that there
should be made brudges of folk upon dyches of the sea / and that was well seyn
at bannokkesborn in Scotland when he was dyscomfyted there of the Scotts / And
Merlyn told also that stones should fall from castle les / and many towns
should be made pleyn / And he said sothe for when king edward was discomfyted in
Scotland and come tho southward / the scotts besyeged tho castles / and did
hem much harm and burnt towns unto the hard earth /

And afterward Merlyn t^ld that an Egle should come out of Corn wayle. that
should have feathers of gold / that of pride should have no pyere. And he should
despise lords of blood / and after (...) should dye through a here at gauersiche
/ and that prophecye was (...) well know and found sothe / For by the Egle is
understand Sir Pyers of ganastone / that tho was earl of Cornewayll that was a
wonder proud man that despised the baronage of England / but afterward he was
byheded at Gauersich through the Earl of lancestre / and through the Earl of
war wyke /

And Merlyn told that in his time it should seem that the here should brenne /
and that battle should be upon an arm of the sea in a field arrayed like a
shield where should dye many white hedes /

And he said sothe for by the brennyng of the here is bitokened great dread
through cuttyng of sword at that bataylle ordained in a field as a shield upon
an arm of the sea is bitokened the batail of mytone / for there comen the
scotts in manner of a shield / in ma ner of a winge and slew upon swale men of
religyon prestes and secu lers / wherefore the scotts called that battle in
despyte of Englissh men the white battle / And after merlyn said that the
foresaid bear should done the got much harm and that should be upon the south
west and also upon his blood / and said also that the got should lose much dele
of his land til the time that shame should him oucome and than he should clothe
him with a lyone skyn / and should win ayene that he had lost and much more
through people that should come out of the northwest that should make him ben
dradde and him avenge of his enemies through cou^ceyle of ij owls / that first
shol de ben in peril to be undone / And that tho two owls should we^de over
the sea in to a strange land / and there they should duelle til a cer tryne time
/ and after they should come in to England again / And tho two owls should do
much harm unto many one and that they should cou^ceylle the got for to meue
werre against the forsaid here / And that the got and the owls should come unto
an arm of the sea at Barton up Trent / and should wend over / and that for
dread the here should flee with a swan in his company unto bury toward the
north through an unkind outepulter / and that the swan than should be slain
with sorrow. and the here should be slain full nyghe his own nest. that should
stand upon pou^tfeete upon whom the son shall shede his bemes / and many
folk him shall seche for the much virtue / and he said full soth / For the good
Erl^ Thomas of lancastre was born in the north west / and cosyn to the king and
sone of his uncle / And by law he made the king lose much la^d / the which he
had purchaced wilfully til at the last the king thereof took shame / and him
self filled with cruelte. And after he gate again that he had lost / and much
more through fel^ that he let assemble out of the northweste that made him to
(...) adrad and auengyd him of his Barons through counseylle of Sire hughe the

him and his sone / and Isabell his wif But the Friar prechours to him were good
friends ever more and cast and ordained both by night and day how they might

time / And at that time the englysshmen were clothed al in cotes and hodes
peynted. with lettres and with flowers full semely with long berdes. And
therefore the scotts made a bylle that was fastened upon the church doors of
saint petre toward stangate / and thus said the scripture in despyte of

How the englysshmen stopped the scotts in the park of stanhope / and how
they turned ayene in to Scotland / Ca / CC / xiiijo. /
ANd at that time the scotts had assembled al her power / and comen in to
England and slew / and robbed all that they' myghten take, and also brenten
and destroyed all the north cou^ tree through out til that they come to the park
of stanhope in wy redale / and there the scotts held hem in a busshement / But
when the king had herd through certain espyes / where the scotts were anon
right with his host besyeged hem within the foresaid park so that the scotts
wist never where to gone out / but only unto her arms. and they abyden in the
park / xv days / and vytaylles hem faylled in every a side / so that they
were gretely empeyred of her bodies / And sith that brute come first in to
britayne unto this time was never seen so fair an host what of Englysshmen and
of Alyens / and of men a for / the which ordained hem for to fight with the
stottes through eggynge of sir henry earl of lancastre, and of sir Johan henaud
/ that would have goone over the wa ter of with for to have fought with the
scotts / But sir rogyer mortimer consented not thereto / For he had privily
taken mede of the scotts hem for to help that they might we^de again in to
her own cou^treye / And the same mortimer counceyled so much Thomas of
brothertone the earl marchal / that was king edwardes uncle / that the foresaid
thomas should not assemble at that time unto the scotts and he assented, but
he wist not the doing between the scotts / and the foresaid mortimer, And for
encheson that he was marchal of England / and to him perteyned ever the
vauntwarde / he sent hastily to therle of lancastre / and to Sir Johan of
henaud that they should not fight. upon the scotts in prejudice and harmyng of
him / and his fee / and if they did that they should stand to her own peril
/ And the forsaid earl marchal was all arrayed with his battle at the reredoos
of the earl of lancastre / for to have fought with him and with his folk / if
he had meued for to fight with the scotts / and in this manner he was deceived
and wist no thing of this treson / And thus was the king prin cipally deceived
/ And when it was night Mortimer that had the wach for to keep of the host
that night distourbled the wach that no / thing might be done / And in the mean
while the scotts stele by night toward her own country as fast as they might
/ And so was the king falsely bytrayd / that wend that that all the traitors
of his land had be brout to an end as it was said before / Now here ye lords
/ how traytoursly king Edward was desceyued / and how meruailously and boldly
ye scotts did of werre / for James douglas with CC men of arms riden thurugh
out the host of king edward the same night the scotts we re escaped toward hit
own country / as is above said / till that they come to the kings pauylon /
and slew there many me^ in her beds and cried some naward naward and anothir
time a douglas a douglas wherefore the king that was in his pauylon and much
other folk were wonder sore effrayed / but blyssed be almighty god the king
was not taken / and in great peril was tho the royame of england And that
night the moon shone full clear and bright / and for all the kyngesmen the
scotts escaped harmele^s, And in the mo row when the king wist that the
scotts were escaped in to her contre. he was wonder sorry. and full hertely
wept with his yo^g eyes and yet wist he not who him had done that treson / but
that falls tree son was full wely know a good while after as the storye tells
The king edward come again tho to york full sorrowful / and his host departed,
and every man went in to his own country with full heavy chere / and morning
semblau^t / and the henewers took her leave / and went in to her country / and
the king for her trauaylle hem hugely rewarded / and for encheson of that vyage
the king had dispended much of his tresour and wasted / and in that time were
seen two mones in the firmament. that one was clear and that other was derk as
men myt tho seen through out the world / and a great debate was that same time
against pope John the xxij after saint peter. and the emperor of almayn tho made
him emperor against the popes will, that the held his see at auinion / wherefore
the emperor made his cry at rome and ordeygned another pope that hight nycholas
/ that was a friar menour / and that was against the right of holy church /
wherefore ^e was acursid / and the power of that other pope sone was leid / And
for encheson that such merueylles were seen / men said that the world was nygh

when he was crou^ed full many wro^ges were don whi le that his f^dre lived / for
encheson that he trowed the cou^ceilers that were falls about him that
cou^ceilled him to d^ne other wise than reason would / wherefore great harm was do
unto the Reame / and to the king and al me^ directed it the kings deed and it
was not so al myty god wot / wherefore it was ordained at the kings crou^yng
that the king for his tender age should be governed by xij great lords of
england without which no thing should be done that is for to say the
archebisshop of canterbury / the archebisshop of york / The bishop of

How the pees was made between the englysshmen / and the scot tes / and also of
Iustyfyeng of Troylbastone / Cao. / CC / xvijo /
THe king Edward at wytsontyde the second year of his reg ne through counceylle
of his mother / and of sire Rogyer mortymer ordeygned a parliament at northampton
/ at the which parliament the king through her cou^ceil and none other of the
land within age granted to ben acorded with the scotts in this manner / that
all the feautes and homages that the scotts should done unto the croun^ of
england foryaf hem unto the scotts for ever more by his chartre ^nfeled / And
ferthermore an endenture was made of the Scotts unto king Edward that was king
henryes sone / which endenture they callid it rageman / in the which were
contained all the ho mages and feautes / First of the king of Scotland and of all the prelatez Earls and barons of the Reame of Scotland with her seals set
thereon and other chartres / and remembraunces that king Edward and his Barons
had of her right in the reame of scotland it was foryeue hem ayene holy church
/ And also with the black cross of scotland. the which the good king Edward
co^ querd in scotland / and brought it out of the Abbay af Scone / that is a
full precious relyque, And also ferthermore he relesed and foryaf all the lands
that the barons of England had in scot land by, old conquest / And this pees
for to hold and last the scot tes were bound unto the king in xxx thousand
pound of silver to be paid within iij year / that is to say every year x
thousand pound by even porcyons / And ferthermore above all this they speak
bitwene the parties above said that dauyd dritonantier that was Robert the Brus
is sone the false tirant and traitor. and falls forswore against his oath that
arose against his lyege lord the noble king Edward, and falsely made him king
of Scotland. that was of age of v year / And so through this cursed counseyll
David spoused at Berewyk dame Johan of the tour that was king Edwardys suster
as the g^est tellyth upon mary magdale ne day in the year of grace a M CCC and
xxviij to greet harm and empeyryng to all the kings blood / whereof that
gentil lady came / Allas the time / For wonder much was that fair damysel
dysparaged since that she was married against all the comune assent of England /
And fro the time that Brute had conquered albion and named the land after his
own name Britayne / that now is called England after the name of Engyst /

And so was the Reame of Scotland holden of the Reame of England and of the
croune by feaute and by homage /

For Brute conquered that land / and yafe it to Albanak his second sone. And he
callid the land Albanye after his own name / So that the heirs that comen
after him helden of Brute / and of his heirs the kings of Britayne by feaute
and homage and from that time unto this king Edward the reame of Scotland was
holden of the reame of England by feautes and seruy^s a boue said as the
Chronicles of england and of Scotland beren wit nesse more plenarly / And
acursed be the time that this parliament was ordained at Northampton / For there
through falls cou^ceil the king was there falsely disheryted / and yet he was
within age /

And yet when king Edward was put a down of his Royalte of england / yet men
put him not out of the feautes / and ser uyces of the reame of Scotland / ne of
the fraunchises disheryted him for evermore. And netheles the great lords of
England were against to conferme the pees / and the trewes above said sauf only
the queen Isabel that was the kings mother edward and the bishop of Ely / and
lord mortimer, but reason and law would not that a fynal pees should be made
between hem without the commune assent of England /

Of the debate that was between queen Isabell / and sir Henry Earl of lancastre
and of leycestre / and of the ridynge of ^edeford / Cao. / CC / xvijo. /
When the foresaid dauyd had spoused Dame Jane of the tour in the town of
Berwyk as before is said the scotts in despyte of the Englysshmen called dame
Jane the Countess make pees / For the cowardo^ pees that was ordained but the
kings person bare the wy^e and the blame with wrong of the making of the
acord / and all was done through the Queen and Rogyer mortimer / And it was not
long aft^r that the Queen Isabell ne took in to her own hand all the lordship
of pountfret almoost all the lands that were of value that apperteyned to the
croune of england / So that the king had not for to dyspende / but of his uses
and of his escheker / For the queen Isabelle and mortimer had a greet meyne
of her ^naunce that followed evermore the kings court, and went and took the
kings prises for her penny worthes at good chepe, wherefore the country that they
comen in were full sore adradde / and almost^ destroyed / Tho bygon the
Comynalte of England for to ^ate Isabell the Queen that so much loved her.
when she come ayene for to pursue the false traitors the spencers fro France /

And that same time the false traitor Robert of Holond that bitrayd his lord
Sir Thomas of lancastre was tho deliuerd out of prison / and was wonder prive
with the Queen Isabelle and also with Rogyer the Mortimer, But that auayled him
but litel for he was take at mychelmasse that tho come n^ sewing after as he
rode toward the queen Isabell to london and sir thomas wither smote of his head
besides the town of saint albones / And this Sir thomas duellid tho with Sir
Henry earl of lancastre and he put him in hydyng for dread of the queen / for
she loved him wonder much and prayed unto the king for him that the same
Thomas must ben exyled out of england / And the Noble Earl Sir Henry lancastre
had oftymes herd the commune cla mour of the englysshmen of the dyseses that
were done in england and also for diverse wrongs that were done among the
comune people of the which the king bare the blame with wrong / for he ^as but
full young and tender of age / and thought as a good man for to done awey and
slake the sklaundre of the kings person if that he might in any manner wise /
So as the king was thereof no thing gylty / wherefore he was in peril of lyth and
lymme And so he assembled al his retenaunces / and went and spoke unto them of
the kings honor / and also for to amend his astate And Sir thomas brotherton
Earl marchal and Sir Edmond of wodestoke that were the kings uncles, and also
men of london made her oath him for to mayntene in that same quarelle.

And her cause was this that the king should hold his household and his meyny as
a king ought for to done and have also his rialte / And that the queen Isabell
should deliver out of her hond in to the kings hand al manner lordshippes
rentes tounes and Castelles that apperteyned to the croune of England as other
Que nes had done before her and meddle with none other thing /

And also that Sire Rog^er mortymer should duelle upon his own lands / for the
which lands he had help disheryte much pe ple / So that comune people were not
destroyed through her wrong full taking / And also to enquere how and by whom
the king was bytrayd and falsely desceyued at Stanhope / and through whose
counceylle that the Scotts went awey by night from the king, And also how and
through whoos counseyll the ordinance that was made at the kings coronacion
was put a down that is for to say that the king for amendment and helpyng of
the Reamme / and in honor of him should be governed and ruled by xij the
grettest and wysest lords of all the Reame and without hem should nothing be
granted / ne done as fore is said the which couenau^ts malyaously were put a
done fro the king wherefore many harms shames and reproues have fall unto the
king and his Reame. And that is understand for as much as Edward sometime king
of England was ordained by assent of the comynalte in plain parliament for to be
under the ward / and governance of Henry Earl of lancastre his cosyn for
sauacion of his body. he was take out of the castle of kenel worth there that he
was in ward / And through color of queen Isabell and of the Mortimer without
consent of any parliament they took and lad him there that never after none of
his kynrede might with him spe^e ne see / and after traytoursly took and him
mordred / For whoos death a foul sklaundre aroos through out al Crystendom when
it was done / And also the Tresour that sir edward of Carnariuan had left in
many places in england and in walye were wasted and bare awey without the
will of king Edward his son in destruction of him and of all his folk /
Also through whose counceyll that the king yaf up the kingdom of Scotlad For the
Which Reame the kings auncestres had full sore y trauaylled / and so did many
a noble man for her right / and was dely uerd unto David / that was Robert the
Brus son all the right that no right had to the Reame as all the world it
wyst^ / And also by whom the chartres and remembraunces that they had (...)
the right of scotland were take out of the tresorye and taken un to the
Scotts the kings enemies to dysherytyng of him and of his successors and to
great harm unto his lyea^s and great (...) prove unto al Englysshmen for
evermore / Also where for dame ^a ne of the tour the kings suster edward was
dysparaged and married unto David / that was Robert the Brus sone that was a
traitor and enemy unto England / And through whose counceille she was take in
to our enemies hondes out of England /

And in the mean time while the good Earl Henry of lancastre and his company
token counseylle how these (...) above said might ben amended unto the worship
of the king and to his profit, and to the profit also of his lyeges / The
(...) Isabel through coniectyng and subtylyte / and also of the Mortimer let
ordeyne a parliament at Salysbury. And at that same ^arleme^t the Mortimer was
made earl of the march against all the barons will of England in preiudyce of
the king and of his Coroune / And Sire Johan of Eltham the kings brother was
gurt with aswerd of Cornewayle and tho was called Earl of Curnewall And
evermore Queen Isabel so much procured a^ste her sone the king. that she had
the ward of the foresaid sir Edward and of his lands, And at that parliament
therle of of Lancastre would not come / but ordained al his power ayens the
queen Isabel / and the mortimer / and men of london ordained hem with v C men
of arms / when queen Isabell wist of the doing / she swore by god and by his
names full angrely / that in evil time he thout upon tho points / Tho sent
the queen Isabell and the mortymer after her retenue. and after the kings
retenue / so that they had ordained among hem an huge host / and they
counceyled the king / so that upon a night they rydden xxiiij mile toward
Bedford there that the Earl of lancastre was with his company / and thought to
have him destroyed / and that night she rode besides the king her sone as a
knight armed for dread of death / and it was done the king to understand that

the comunes of england durst call him by none other name for he was called so
through the kings cry that men should, call him earl of the march / and the
Mortimer bare him tho so hauteyn and so proud that wonder it was for to wit /
and also disgised him with wonder rich clothes out of al manner reason both of

wretchedness yt he held a rou^ de table in walys to al men that thider would

ANd upon a time it byfel so that sir Edmond of wodestoke Earl of kent spoke
unto the pope Johan the xxij of Auynyon and said that almighty god had softymes
done for thomas love of lancastre many great miracles to many men and women
that were through diverse maladyes undone as unto the world and through his
prayer they were brought unto her hele / And so Sir Edmond prayed the pope
hertely that he would grant him grace yt the forsaid thomas myt be translated,
but the pope said nay that he should not be translated unto the time that he
were better certifyed of ye clergy of england and seyn by her obedyence what
thing god had done for the love of thomas of lancaster after the suggestyon yt
the foresaid Edmond earl of kent had unto him y made / And when this edmond saw
that he might not speed of his purpose as touching the translacio^ / he praid
him of his cou^ceil as touching sir edward of Carnariuan his brother / and said
that not long agone he was king of england what thing mit best be done as
touching his deliuerau^ce since that a comune fame is through england that he is
in lif and hole and sauf / when the pope herd him all that Sir edward was
alive / he commanded the earl upon his beneson that he should help with all the
power that he might that he were deliud out of prison / and save his body in all
manner that he myt / and for to bring this thing to an end he assoilled him
and his company a pena and culpa / and al tho that help to his delyuerau^ce /
Tho took Edmond of wodestok his leave of the pope / and come ayene in to england
/ and when sir Edmond was come / some of the Friar prechours come and said that
sir edward his brother yet was alive in the castle of corf under the keeping of
sir thomas gurnay / Tho sped him the forsaid edmond as fast as he might til
that he come unto the Castle of Corffe / and acqueynted / and spak so fair

yeftes for to have acquaintance of him / and to know of his cou^ceyl / And
thus it byfel that the foresaid Sir edmond prayed specially to tell him privily
of his lord his brother Sir edward if that he lived or were deed / and if he
were alive he prayed of him ones to have a sight / And this Sir Johan Dauerill
was an high herted man and full of courage and ansuerd shortly unto sir Edmond
and said that sir edward his brother was in hele / and under his keeping / and
durst show him unto no man / since it was defended him in the kings half
edward that was edwardes sone of car narinan / and also through comau^dement of

edward his brother / as to his worthy lord / And be vnderfeng the lre^ of him
and behit him for to done his message without any manner faill / and with that
sir edmond took of him his leave then of the foresaid John / and went tho in to
his own country and lordship in kent that he had there / And anon as this same
John wise that sir edmond was gone in to kent his own lordship, anon he went
in all the have that he myt fro the castle of Corfe / and come unto sire Rogyer
the mortimer / and took him the lre^ that sir edmond of wode stok earl of kent
had take him closed / and enseled with his own seal / And when sir rogyer had
vnderfong the letter he unclosed the lre^. and saw what was contained therein /
and began it for to read / where of the beginning was this / worshippes and
reuerences with brothers legeaunce and subjection / Sire knight worshipful and

with all her apparayll / that is to say with armure with tresour without nombre
for to mayntene and help your quarrel / so forsooth that ye shall be king ayene
as ye were be fore / and that they al have swore to me upon a book / and as well
prelates as Earls and Barons / when Sir Rogrer the Mortymer saw and understood
the might and the strength of the letter / anon for wrath his heart began holle
/ and evil heart bare toward Sire Edmond of wodestok that was Earl of kent, and
so with all the haste that he might / he went to Dame Isabelle the queen that
was the kings mother and showed her Sir Edmu^des letter and his will and his
purpoose / and how he had conice ted and ordained to put a down king edward of
wyndesore her sone of ryal^ and of his kingdom / Now (...) sir rogyer quod the
queen has sir edmond done so / by my fadres soul quod ^he (...) will be the^f

letter that sir Edmond of wodestok Earl of kent had made and ensealed with his
own seal / and bad upon her beneson that he should be auengyd upon him, as upon

Tho was the queen so wroth toward Sir Edmond Earl of kente / and ^sid never

the which was put a down of his (...) al^ by ^mune asse^t of all the lords of
england in pesyng of our lord the kings astate / and also of his reame / Tho
ansuerd the good man and said / forsooth sir understands well that I was never
traitor to my king ne to the reame / and that I do me on god and on all the
world / and ferthermore by my kings leave I shall preue it and defend as a man
ought to do / Tho said Mortimer Sir Edmond it is so forsothe y know that it
may not well ben gayn said / and that in presence of all that here ben it shall
well ben proved / Now had this fal^ mortimer the same letter that sir Edmond
had take to sir Johan dauerell in the castle of corff for to take unto king
Edward his brother that sir Edmond wist not of ne supposed no nothing that sir
Johan dauerel had be so falls to deliver his l^ in such wise to the mortimer and
thout no manner thing of that letter and said to sir edmond and showed a letter
se^d and axid him if he knew that letter and the seal / This sir Edmond looked
thereon and auised him long on the prynt of the seal / for he myt not see the
let ter within forth what was therein / and wiste well that it was his seal / and
thought that it had be some letter that had bore no great charge / and thought
nothing of that other letter / and said openly in heryng of hem al ye forsooth
this is my seal I will it not forsake ^o quod the mortimer sirs ye heren all
what he has said and that he knoulecheth that this is his letter and his seal

opened the letter that he had folden a fore to geder / and red it open ly word

yafe dome that he should be honged and draw / and his heed smite of in manner
of a traitor / and he and his heirs dysheryted for evermore* and so he was
ladde forth and put in to prison / And when this was done and the queen wyste
that he was dampened by wey of law both of life and lymme and his heirs
dysheryted for evermore thurg^ open knoulechyng in pleyn court / Wherefore hem
thought that were good that the foresaid Sir Edmond were hastily y slain
without wytyng of the king / or else the king would lightly for give him his
death / and than that should torn hem to much sorrow so as he was empeched / And
anon the queen through counceylle of the mortimer and without any other

ANd so it be fell at that time that sir Rogyer Mortymer Earl of the march was
so proud and so hauteyne that he held no lord of the Reamme his pere. and tho
become he so covetous that he followed Dame Isabell the Qnenes court / that was
king Edwardes mother and beset his penny worthes with the officers of the que nes
household in ye same manner that the kings officers did and so he made his
taking as touching vitails and also of caryages / and al he did for cause of
spences and for to gadre tresour / and so he did without no^bre in all that he
might. Tho made he him wonder prive with the queen ^abel / and so much lordship
and retenue had / so yt all the gre te lords of england of him were adr^d,
wherefore the king and his co^ ceyl toward him were agreued and ordained among
hem to undo him through pure reason and law for cause that king edward that was
the kings fadre traitoursly through him was mordred in the castle of berklee as
bifere is said more plenarly in the CC xvij chapter of this book / And some
that were of the kings cou^ceil loved the mortimer and told him in priuete how
that the king and his cou^ceyl were about from day to day him for to shend and
undone where for the mortimer was sore a^noyed and angry as the devil against hem
that were of the kings cou^ceyl and said that he would on hem ben auengyd / how
so ever he took on / ^it was not long after ward that king edward and dame
phelip his wife and dame Isabel the kings mother and sir Rogyer the mortimer ne
went unto no tyngham there for to soiourne / and so it byfell that the queen
Isabel through counsel of the mortimer took to her the keys of the yates of
the castle of Notyngham / so that no man might come nether in ne out by night
but through commandment of the mortymer ne the king ne none of his cou^seyl /
And that time it byfel so that the mortimer as a devil for wrath bolled / and
also for wrath that he had against the kings men edward / and principally
against hem that had him accused to the king of the death of sir edward his fadre
/ And privily a cou^ceylle was take between queen Isabel / and the Mortimer and
the bishop of lyncoln / and s^r Symond of Bereford and sir hugh of Trumpyngton

mortimer unto the king of his fadres death of treson and of felonye / wherefore al
tho that were of the kings cou^ceyl when they wist of the mortimers castyng
pre uely come to king edward, and seyde that the mortimer would hem de stroye
for cause that they had accused him of king edwardes death his fadre and prayed
him that he would mayntene hem in her right And these were the lords to pursue
this quarelle / Sire william mountagu / Sir hu^frey de boghun. Sir william his

so af^r / that sir william mou^tagu ne none of the kings friends must not ben
herburg^ed in the Ca stel for the mortimer. but went and took her lodgyng in
diverse places in the town of notyngham / And tho were they sore adrad lest
that the mortimer should hem destroy. and in have there come un to king edward
Sir william mountagu / there that he was in the castle / and privily told him
that he ne none of his company should not take the mortimer without cou^ceyl

said mountagu / Sir my lord grant mercy / (...) went forth the foresaid
mountagu and come to the Conestable of the castle / and told him the kings
will / And he ansuerd and said that the kings w^l should be done in as much as
he might and that he would not spare for no manner death / and so he swore and
made his oath / Tho said Sir william mountagu to the Conestab^e in ^erynge of
al men that were helping unto the quarrel / Now certes dear friend us behooves
for to worche / and do by your ^yntise fo: to take the mortimer since that ye be
kepar of the castle / and have the keys in your ward / sir quoth the conestable /

unto the abbay of Dunfermelyne / and there be found vytaylles for him and for
his folk and among al other things he fond in a chamber about v honderd of
great staves of fine oak with long pykes of yren and of stele. he took hem and
delyuerd hem to the most strengest men of his company / And anon after he
went fro thens, and lodged him in a field ij mile from saint Johannes town
and when the burgeis of the tonne herd how the Earl of Fyffe was discomfyted
through the Bayllol they were sore adrad and breken their brydges that they had
made over the water of Erue / so that the bayllol might not gone over wherefore
he lodged him there all that night / but litel head he took of rest / and said
unto his people / Now dear lords ye know full well, that we be now y lodged
between our enemies / And if they mow us hampre / there is no bote but death
wherefore if we abide here all this night stylle / I leave that it shall torn us
to much sorrow and harm / For the power of Scotland may every day weye and
increase / and we may not so done / And we ben but little people as against hem.
wherefore I pray you for the love of Almighty god make we us bold and hardy and
that we may myghtely take the scotts this night and boldly werre upon hem
and let us pursue hem this night, and if they be trauaylled through us / and
they see our hardynesse / so that other Scotts that comen and mete hem and see
hem so trauaylled and weary / the sorer will they be adrad with us for to fight.
and fiersly than we shall fight with hem / and upon hem pursue / so that through
the grace of God Amyghty all the world shall speak of the doughtnes of our
Chyualrye /

And sirs understands well that all the company that comen with sir Edward
bayllol granted well unto that counceyll / and were there of glad / and anon
pursued upon the Scotts / that they byco me wonder weary. And the Bayllol and
his company sore followed hem / and did hem much sorrow through her assaute / so
that they might not for feeble hem help and for little people / but tho said the
Scotts among hem what is now byfal / that so li cell a people. as the bayllol
has in wynge / done us so much traua ylle and sorrow / Now certes it seems
us, that he worcheth by grace / for he is wonder gracious in his quarrel / and
al we certes shall ben deed or that we may come to him us for to yield since that
his fadre set of us no prys And among all other things the Bayllol, and his
people passed the water of Erue / so that sire Rogyer of Swynerton the sone was
fyers and angry. and went forth / and they saw people of arms full well arrayed /
and forth they went un to hem, and with hem foughten / and slew as many as
would abide and took / And netheles at that assaute they wend it had be the
great host of Scotland / And when it come to the morn / they gadred hem to
geder / and rested hem a whrle But the while that the Eglysshmen rested hem the
noble Baron Thomas of vesey and the noble baron of stafford pril^ed her lo^s up
and down by the hills for to keep the estres of the country And as they
pryked up and down / they saw a great host of good array ordained in three
wings with helmes, and sheldes shynyng co myng upon hem / and tho come tho two
lords ayene unto baillols folk / and said / Now for the love of almighty god
ben of good co^ fort / For ye shall have battle anon right / And tho spoke Sir
fouke the sone of gareyne a baron of great reno^me and of deed of ar mes /
Syres lordynges understands that I will say / I have seyn many diverse
wings as well among sarazyns and Iewee as among the scotts / And yet saw I
never the ferth part of the wyn ge fight / and therefore if we will abide our
enemies / we be ynowe for to fight against hem / But if we be not of good heart
and of good will late us not fight with hem / for certes we ben full few a^ns
this company / And therefore for the love of god take unto us a good heart, and
let us ben bold and thenke we nether on our wy ues ne on our children / but
onlyche to conquer hem in batayl / and through the help of our lord god our
enemies we shall overcome And with that come the host of the scotts toward
hem full fie sly / and against sir Edward the Bayllol in three bataylles well
arrayed in armure And wonder syerly they come toward the Bayllols men / But when
Sire Donald earl of Marall saw all this / he said to Robert Buts the sone of
Robert the brus these words / Sir Robert quod he full sore me forthynketh at my
ne heart that these folk that the baillol had brout with him should dye with dynt
of scottissh swerd / since yt they ben christian men as well as we ben. And therefore
me thinks that it were great charity to send unto hem for to yield hem unto
our mercy and grace / and raunsonne hem through grievous raunsonne / for as much
as they have taken our land and done ylle / Now certes quod sir robert the Brus
I have well perceived that thou art an enemy / and a trai tour unto scotland /
since that thou wylt consent to save our dedely enemies that have done us much
sorrow / and shame / and now it seems well that ye ben of her assent / Certes
Robert quod Sire Donald falsely ye lie / I am not of her company / ne of her
consent and that hastily ye shall see / For I will fight with hem rather than
any of this company / And certes sir Robert said he I shall maugre thyn head
assaylle hem er thou / And with that they prike ten her stedes fiersly upon
Caskemore and her wenges he in fool wrd on a venge / And tho come they and met
the baillol / and his co^pa nigh at an hongyng bought of the more in a streit
passage / and so fast they hasted hem unto the englysshmen / so that thousands
fell to the ground each up other in to a hepe both horse and man / The baillol
tho and his men myghtely stood against hem / and fast slew scotts unto the
ground / and many sore they wounded so long til that they stoden upon hem and
feined hem with her swerdes and speres through her bodies / and so sore
trauailled upon hem til that they bioomen full weary. and wist not what for to
done / and the scotts that were left ali ue fledden a wey for to save hem self
in the best man as they myt

And tho pursued hem sir edward bayllol and his men and slew of hem til that
it was nyt / And fro thens they went unto saint Iohans town and took it and
held hem there / and vitaylled hem self at her own will for they fou^den ynowe
wherewith to make hem merry

Tho made the bayllol his men that were wounded gone to ship for to we^de in
to england for to hele her wou^des / And in that time there was a flemmyng in
the sea a strong these and a robber that was called Crabbe / And this Flemmynge
was driven out of Flaundres for his wykkednes. And therefore he come in to
Scotland to hold with the Scotts / and did as much harm unto Englysshmen
as he might / And this Crabbe met in the sea the Bayllols men that were wounded
in battle / that were sent ayene in to England for to hele her wounds / And
this Crabbe yafe unto hem a great assaute / and would have slain hem eueryeho ne
/ but the englysshmen defended hem well and manly / and disco^fited Crabbe and
his company / And tho gone he flee in to Scot land / And as he come toward
saint Iohans town / he found a gre te company of scotts that were comen ageyn
to geder after the die scomfiture of gaskemore / the which besyeged bayllol and
his me^ in the same town of saint Johan / and anon told the scotts how that
he was discomfyted of the Englysshmen that were wounded at gaskemore / that
went toward England for to hele her wou^des and said to the scotts that they
should have no might ne grace against edward Bayllol for encheson that
scomfyted and empeired all the chyualrye of Scotland with an handeful of men /
as to ac count / as against the Scotts that were slain / wherefore he
cou^ceilled for to remeue the fiege from saint Iohans town / and keep hem in
the best manner that they could and might / The scotts understood tho that
Crabbe said hem soth / and forsook the siege and went thens by night / and
halpe hem self in the best manner that they mit

When this thing was know through scotland / how that the lords and knights
were scomfyted at Gaskemore of Scotland through sir Edward the bayllol / ye shall
understand that the lor des and ladies and the gentiles of scotland comen
wonder fast to saint Iohanes town / and yield hem unto the bayllol / and to him
dyden homage and feaute for her lands / and yelden hem to his pees, And he hem
resceyued freely / And fro thens he went to the Abbey of Scone / and there he was
crouned king of Scotland / And after he let cry his pees through out all the
land / And at that same time it bifell that king edward held his parliament
among his lyeges at the new Castle up Tyne for to amend the trespa ces and
the wrongs that had be done in his land / and sir Edward the bayllol king of
Scotland come to him thither / and did to him seante and homage for the reame of
scotland / And in this manner king Edward of England gadred again the homages
and fe autes of Scotland. whereof he was put out through counceyll and assent of
dame Isabell his mother and of sir Rog^er the mortimer Earl of the march, Tho
took baillol king of scotland his leave of king Edward of England and went thens
in to his own la^d of Scotland / and set but little by hem that had
cou^ceylled him / and helped him in his quarrel / wherefore they went fro him and
went and lived by her lands and rentes in scotland / And so it fell
afterward not long that the king of scotland ne remeued and come to the tonne
of Anand, and there took his duellyng / and thither come to him a company of
knights strong men and worcester thy / and yield hem unto the king / and bear hem so
fair in deed / and in contynaunce / so that he trust much upon hem / And
anon as the traitors saw that he trust much upon hem / they ordained among
hem / l / in a company / and would have slain her king / but through the grace
of almyty god he brake through a wall an hole in his chamber / and as god would
escaped her trecherye / and all his men were slain / and he escaped with much
dread unto the town of cardoyll / and there held him sore annoyed / and this
byfelle in our ladies eve the concepcion / Tho sent king edward the Baylloll to
king Edward of England / how falsely and traytoursly he was in little time put
to shame and sorrow through his lyegemen upon whom he trusted wonder much / and
prayed him for the love of god that he would mayntene him / and help him against
his enemies / The king of England had tho of him great pity / and behyght him
help and socour / and sent him word that he should hol de him in pees stylle
in the foresaid Cite of Cardoyll / till that he had gadred his power / Tho
ordained king edward of England a counceylle at london and let gadre his men
in diverse shyres of England / And when he al was ready / he went toward the
town of Berwyk up Twede / and thither come to him king Edward Bayllol of
Scotland with his power / and besyeged the Town and made without the town a
fair town of ^auylons / and dyked hem al about / sa that they had no dread of
the Scotts / and made many assaute with gonnes. and with other engynes to the
town / wherewith they destroyed many fair houses and chirches al so were beat
down unto the earth with great stones / that spytously come out of gonnes and
of other engynes / And netheles the soottes kept well the town / that tho two
kings might not come therein long time / And netheles the kings abide there so
long / til tho that were in the town faylled vytaylles / and al so they were
so weary of wakyng that they wist not what for to done / And ye shall understand
that tho Scotts that were in the Town of Berewyk through common counseille and
her assente lets cry upon the wallys of the Town that they might have pees of
the Englysshmen / And thereof they prayden the king of his grace and mercy /
and prayden him of trewes for eight days upon this covenant / that if they
were not rescued in that side of the town toward Scotla^nd of the Scotts
within eight days that they would yield hem unto the king and the town also
and to hold this covenant they profred to the king xij hostages out of the
town of her wist / When the hostages were delyuerd un to the king / anon tho
of the town sent unto the scotts and told hem of her sorrow and meschyef /
And the Scotts come tho privily over the water of Twede to the bought of the
Abbey / and sir Will iam dyket that was tho styward of scotland and many other
that come with him put hem there in great peril of hem self at yt time of her
life for they comen over a bridge that was to broke / and the stones awey / and
many of her company were there dre^ched / but the foresaid william went over and
other of his company / and come by the ships of England / and slew in a
barge of hull (...) me^ And after they went in to the town of Berwyk by the
water side / wherefore the scotts held tho the town rescowed / and asked her
hostages again of the king of England / And the king sent hem word again
that they axed the hostage with wrong since yt they comen in to the town of
england side / for covenant was by twene hem that the town should be rescued
by the half of Scotland / And anon king edward tho commanded to yield the
town or he would have the hostages / And the Scotts said that the town was
rescued well ynowe. and there to they would hold hem / when king edward saw the
scotts break her connenau^t that they made he was wonder Wroth / and anon let
take sir thomas fytz william and sir alysander of Seton wardeyne of Berwyk /
the which tho mas was person of dunbarre / and let hem be take first before
that other hostages for encheson that sir Alysandres fadre was (...) of the
town / and tho comau^ded every day ij hostages of the town to (...) slain til
that they were al done unto the death but if they yield the town / And so he
should teache hem to break her couenauntes And when tho of the town herd these
things / they bioomen wo^ der sorry / and sent to the king of England that he
would grant. hem other viij days of respyte / so that between two ^nderd men
of arms and xx men of arms might by strength gone by twene hem of the town
of Berwyke hem for to vytoylle that the town must be hold for rescued / And
if so were that xxj or xxi^ / or more were slain of tho two honderd before said
that the town should not be hold for rescued / and this covenant to beholden
/ they sent to him other xij of the town in hostage / The king of England
granted hem her prayer and took the hostages in saint margaretes eve in the
year of grace a M CCC / and xxxij the scotts come fiersly in four wings well
arrayed in arms for to mete king Edward of england / and Edward the king of
Scot land and with her power / and come fast and sharply against euensong
time, and the same time was flode at Berewyk in the water of Twede that no man
might wend over on his horse nor on foot / and the water was between the ij
kings and the reame of England / And that time abyden the scotts in that
other side for encheson that the englysshmen should have been dreynt or slain

cowardly / Than they that were in the town and in the castle besieged seeing all this how that they had none other help ne so cour of the king of france ne of
his men / And also that her vyta ylles within hem were spended and wasted and
for defaute of vytaylles and of refresshynge they eten horse hou^des cattes and

found among hem at last that they had no thing among hem for to ete ne
live by / ne none socour / ne rescu enge of the frensshmen of that other side /
they wist well that they must needs dye for defaute or else yield the town /

And when king Edward saw this / as a mercyable king and lord resseyued al to

and so great wa tres that from Crystemasse unto mydsomer there was uneaths day
ne nyt / but that it rayned somewhat / through which watres the pestylence was
so enfected* and so habundau^t in all countries and namely about the court of
Rome and other places and see costs / that uneath there were left living folk
to burye hem that were deed honestly / But maden great dyches and pyttes that
were wonder broad and deep / and therein buried hem* and maden a renge of deed
bodies* and cast a little earth to hele hem above / and than cast in another
renge of deed bodies / and another renge of ^th above hem / And thus were they
buried / and none other wise / But if it were the fewer that weren great men of
astate / that weren buried as honestly as they might / And after all this in the
xxiiij year of king Edwardes regne / hit was him to done to wit and
understand of a treson that was be gonne at Caleys / and ordained for to self
that town for a great sum of floreyns unto king phelyp of France through the

were in the castle that they might not help hem self* ne let hem of her
purpose / And than wenyng that they had be syker ynowe they speken all her
wykkednesse and falsenesse openly* an high that al men might here /

And now shall ye here how they were deceyned* for they comen in by a prive
posterne over a little bridge of tree / And when they were comen in / subtylly
and privily the bridge was drawn up and kept that none of hem that comen in
might gone ont n^ no mo come in to hem / And anon our Englysshmen wenten out
at prive holes and wyndowes / and over the walls of the town and of the castle
/ and wenten / and foughten manly with the frensshmen that were without / and
had the better of hem the which when they weren occupied by hem self on her

by the grace of god Almighty the victory fill to the Englysshmen / Than the
king took with him this gef froy that was fynder of this trecherye / and also
many other fre^ssh prisones / And within a while after come ayene in to
England* And in this same year / and in the year before / and also in the year
next after was so great pestylence of men fro the eest in to the weste / and
namely through botches that tho that siked on this day dyed on the in day / to
the which men that so deyden in this pestylence hadden but litell respyte of
lyggyng / The pope clement of his goodness and grace yafe hem full remissyon /
and foryeuenes of al her sins that they were shriuen of / and this pestylence
lasted in london fro mych^ mass in to august next folewyng almoost an hoole
year / and in the se days was death without sorrow / weddynges without
friendship wylful penance and derth without scarcite and fleing without
refute of socour / for many fledden fro place to place by cause of the
pestylence / but they were enfect / and might not escape the death after that
the prophet Isaie says / who that flees fro the face of dread he shall fall
in to the dyche / And he that wendeth him ont of the the dyche / he shall be
hold and teyde with a grenne / but when this pestylence was seced / as god would
uneaths the x part of the people was left alive / And in the same year bigan a

Judged unto the death / And this was the Judgment / that they should be ladde
through Hampton And without N^thgate there to be heded, And thus they ended her

when they should play / their song was well awey / And allas that ever any fu
che tenys balls were made / and cursed al tho that werre bygan / and the time
that ever they were borne / And on the morrow the king did cry at every gate of
the town. that every man should be ready on the morrow erly to make assaute unto
the town, And William Bouchyer. and Johan grant with xij other worthy Burgeys
comen to the king and besought him of his ryall prince hode and power to
withdraw his malice and destruction / that he did unto hem / and besought him
of eight days of respi^e and ^rewes, if any rescue might come unto hem / and
else to yield up the town unto him with all her goods / And than the king
sent forth the Capytayne / and kept the remenaunt stylle with him / And the
lord Gaucorte / that was Captain of the town went forth to Rone in all haste
unto the Dolphyne for help and socoure / But there was none, ne no manner of
rescue / for the Dolphyne would not abide. And thus this Capitayn come ayene
unto the king and yield up the town / and delyuerd him the keys, And than he
called his uncle the earl of Dorsett / and made him Capytayne of the town of
harflete / and delyuerd him the keys. and badde him gone to put out all the
frenssh people / both men. women and children / and stuffed this town of

and inhabyte him there in that town. he should have house and household to him
and his heirs for evermore. And so thydder went many diverse merchants and
crafty men / and enhabyted hem there to strength the town and weren welcome /
And when the king saw that this town was well stuffed / ^o the of v^yll and of

the frensshmen herd of his coming / they thought to stop him his wey / that
he should not pass that way and in all the have that they might breken all the
bridges there any passage was for horse and man / in so much / that there might
noma^ pass over the Ryuers another on horse / ne on foot / but if ^e shol de be
drowned. And therefore our king with all his people went and sought his wey f^r up
unto paris ward / and there was all the rial power of france assembled / and

he would grant him that day the auauntward in his bataylle, And the king
granted him his askyng, And said grant mercy Cosyn of york / and prayed him
to make him ready. And than he bad every man to ordeyne a stake of tree / and

they were ready / he asked / what time of the day it was. and they said pryme /
Than said our king / now is good time / For all England praith for us / and
therefore be of good chere / and let us goo to our journeye / And than he said
with an high voys / In the name of Almighty god / and of saint George a vau^t
Baner / and saint George this day thine help / And than these frensshmen come
prikynge down / as they would have over ryden all our meyny / But god and our
Archyers made hem sone to stomble / For our Archyers ^et never arowe amys but

lords body that they should love and assiste each other against their enemies /
and after this contrary to this oath / the dule Johan of Burgoyn was slain /
and pytously murthred in the pre sense of the dolphyn / wherefore the frensshmen
were gretely divided and of very necessite labourid to have a trayttye with

them self without hem And yet when he was slain the Archyers come and rescued
the bo die of the duk / which they would have carried with hem / god have mercy on

Of the lawde of king henry the fyfthe / and what he ordeyued for king Rychard.
and for him self after his death. Capitulo ducentesimo / xlvjo /
HEre is to be noted that this king henry the / v, was a noble prince after he
was king and crouned / how be it to fore in his yongthe he had been wyld
recheles / and spared no thing of his lusts ne desires, but accomplysshed them
after his lykyng / but as soon as he was crouned / enoynted and sacred / anon
suddenly he was chau^ ged in to a new man / and set al his intent to live
virtuously in mayntenyng of holy church / destroyeng of heretykes. keeping Ius
tice / and defendyng of his reame and subgettes / And for as much as his fadre
had deposed by his labor / the good king Rychard / and pytously made him to
dye / and for thoffence done to him against his lygeau^ce / he had sent to rome
to be assoilled thereof / for which off^ce the pope our holy fadre enjoined him
to make him be prayed for perpetuelly, and like as he had done to be taken from
him his naturel life / therefore he should do found / iiij / tapers to brenne
perpetuelly about his body / that for the extynction of his bodily life his sou
le may ever be remembrid / and live in heaven in spirituel life / and also that
he should every weke on the day as it comes about of his death have a solemn
mass of Requie^ / on the even before a dirige with ix lessons / and a dole to
pour people alwey on that day of xj shyllyn ges. viij / pens to be delyd penny
melo / And ones in the year at his annyuersarye his terement to be holden in
the most honest wise, and to be deled that day / xx / pound in pens to pour
people, and to every mo^st to have xx shillynges / which al these things
performed this noble king for his fadre / for king henry ye iiij his fadre per
formed it not during his ^f / whom as it is said god touchid and was a lepre er
he deyde / Also then this noble prince let do call le all the abbots and
priours of saint benets order in england / and had them in the chapitre house of
westmynstre for the reformacion of the order wheryn he had comynycacion, And
also with bisshops and men of the spu^alte / in so ferforth that they doubted
sore / he would have had the te^poraltees out of their hondes. wherefore by thaus
labor and procuryng of the spiritualte encouraged the king to cha lenge
normandy / and his right in france / to then de to set him a werk there that he
should not seek occasions to enter in to such matters / and al his life after he
labored in the werrys in co^queryng great par te of the reame of france /
that by the agreement of the king charlys had all the governance of the reame of
france / and was proclaimed regent and heyr of france / And so not
withstondyng all this greet werre that he had / yet he reme^brid his soul^ /
and also that he was mortal / and must dye / for which he ordained by his life
the place of his sepulture / where he is now beryed / and every day three masses
per tuelly to be songen in a fair chapel over his sepulture / of which the
myddedel mass / and the first / and less mass shall be as is assigned by him
/ as it apperyth by these versys fool wynge /

AFter king henry the / v. reigned henry his sone but a child and not fully a

cccc / xxij / This king being in his cradell was much doubted and drad by cause
of yegrete conquest of his fadre and also the wisdom and guydyng of his uncles
the duk of bedford and the duk of gloucestre / This year the xxj day of Oc^
deyde char les king of france / and lies buried at saint denis / and then was
the duk of bedford made regent of france, and the duk of gloucestre was made
protector and defendour of england / and the first day of march after was sir

was brent in smythfeld for heresye / This year sir James stiward king of
scotts married dame Jane the duches dou ghter of clarence of her first husbond
therle of somersete at saint mary ouerayes / Also this year the xvij day of
august was the ba tail of vernoil in perch bitwene the duk of bedford rege^t

ford had on his side with him therle of salisbury mou^tagu / and the the lord

scotts / and ar mynakes, And then therle douglas called the duk of bedford
Johan with the leden swerd. and he sent him word again that he should find

sides / and fought long / that there wyste no man who should have the better a
great while / but at last as god would / the vyctorye fyl unto the englyssh
party / For there were slain therle douglas which a little before was made

In the thyrdde year of king henry the / vj, the duke of gloucestre married the
duchess of holand / and went over see with her in to henaude for to take
possession of his wyfes enherytau^ce / where he was honorably received and
taken for lord of the land / But sone after he was fayn to return home again
and left his wife and his tresour that he brought with him in a Town that is
callid Mou^ce in henaude. which promised for to be true to him / not

the foresaid duchess of holand which louded at a place in zeland called brewers
haven, where the lords of the contre come down / and fought with him, and in
conclu sion he was fayn to withdraw him and his meyny to the sea agey ne / But
yet he slew and hurt diverse lords, and much people of that same country /
And so returned home again with his meyny / and prevailed nothing / Also this
same year Earl of Salysbury / the Earl of Suffolk / the board wylby and the lord

come to the king / which was al promised by the king / And so the king
