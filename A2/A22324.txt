A Proclamation concerning Buildings in, and about London.
Whereas We, by diverse Our Royal Proclamations yet in force, have heretofore
published Our pleasure, grounded upon just and important reasons, concerning
the public, as well for restraining of Building upon new Foundations, in, and
near the City of London, as for prescribing the materials, and manner of
Buildings there, and sundry other things in the same Proclamations mentioned;
And to the same end and purpose have awarded several Commissions under Our
great Seal of England, unto sundry of the Lords of Our Privy Council, and
others: And whereas the same Our Royal providence, for the weal and honor of
that Our Imperial City, has produced good effects, and most men (especially
persons of best rank and quality, in, and about the said City) have readily
submitted to Our princely directions: Nevertheless, because some others, in,
and about the said City, have endeavored to withstand and cross so
honorable a design; We have thought fit eftsoons to publish and declare Our
constant resolution, That Our former directions, given by Our said
Proclamations and Commissions, shall from henceforth, as heretofore, be duly
observed, and put in exact execution. And therefore We do hereby forewarne all
persons, of whatsoever estate, degree, or condition they be, whom the same may
any way concern, That they do yield all dutiful obdience thereto, upon pain
of Our indignation, and high displeasure, and such further pains, penalties,
and severe punishments, as in the said Proclamations are contained; We being
fully resolved, to call all such, as have, or shall offend therein, to strict
account; Any former forbearance, or conniuence, of any Our Officers or
ministers trusted therein, notwithstanding. And to the intent Our pleasure in
this behalf, may take the better effect, We do hereby straightly charge and
command, not only the Mayor and Sheriffs of the city of London, and all and
singular Justices of peace, and other Officers, within the extent of Our former
Proclamations and Commission, to execute and perform all and every thing,
which by the said former Proclamations they are commanded to do, but also all,
and every the Aldermen of the several Wards, within the said city of London,
and their Deputies, That they, and every of them, in their respective Wards and
Precincts, do diligently observe, and enquire out all offenses, which are, or
shall be committed, contrary to the said former Proclamations, and either take
present order for the speedy reformation and amendment thereof, or in case of
refusal, or wilful neglect, after such order, or due monition given, to
certify the same, either to the Lords of Our Privy Council, or to Our
Commissioners for Buildings, for further course to be taken, for reformation of
the offense, and punishment of the delinquents, as to justice shall appertain,
upon pain, that the said Aldermen and their Deputies being remiss, shall
incur Our indignation, and such severe punishment, as the neglect of this Our
Royal commandment shall deserve.

Given at Our Court at Theobalds the fourteenth day of July, in the two and
twentieth yeereof Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton and John Bill, Printers to the Kings most
Excellent Majesty. 1624.
