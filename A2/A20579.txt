A NIEVVE HERBALL, OR HISTORY OF PLANTS: wherein is contained the whole
discourse and perfect description of all sorts of Herbs and Plants: their
diverse and sundry kinds: their strange Figures, Fashions, and Shapes: their
Names / Natures / Operations / and Virtues: and that not only of those which
are here growyng in this our Country of England / but of all others also of
forrayne Realms / commonly used in Physic.

First set forth in the Doutche or Almaigne tongue, by that learned D. Rembert
Dodoens, Physician to the Emperor: And now first translated out of French
into English, by Henry Lyte Esquyer.

AT LONDON by my Gerard Dewes, dwelling in Pawles Churchyard at the sign of
the Swanne. 1578.

Like as the Swanne does chaunt his tunes in sign of joyful mind,
So Lyte by learning shows him self to Prince and Country kind.
To the most High, Noble, and Renowned Princess, our most dread redoubted
Sovereign Lady Elizabeth, by the grace of God, Queen of England, France,
and Irelande, defendour of the faith, etc. Your graces most humble, loyal, and
faithful subject Henry Lyte, wishes long life, perfect health, flourishing
reign, and prosperous success to Gods good pleasure, in all your most Royal
affairs.
TWO things have moved me (most noble Princess) having newly translated into
English this Herball or History of Plants (not long sithence, set forth in
ye Almaigne or Douche tongue, by that paynefull and learned Physician D.
Rembert Dodoens, and sithence that, again by the travail of sundry skylfull
Herbarians into diverse other languages translated) to offer the same unto your
Majesty's protection. The one was that most clear, amiable and cheerful
countenance toward all learning and virtue: which on every side most
brightly from your Royal person appearing, has so enflamed and encouraged,
not only me, to the love and admiration thereof: but al such others also,
your Graces loyal subjects, which are not to to dull of understanding: that
we think no travail to great, whereby we are in hope both to profit our
Country, and to please so noble and loving a Princess: whose whole power and
endeavor we see thereto bent, that virtue and knowledge (the two most beautiful
ornaments of a well governed kingdom) may flourish and bear sway: Vice and
ignorance (the foes of all goodness) may vanish and give place. The other was,
that earnest zeal, and fervent desire that I have, and a long time have had,
to show my self (by yielding some fruit of paineful diligence) a thankeful
subject to so virtuous a Sovereign, and a fruitful member of so good a common
Weal. The first of these, hartened or emboldened me against those persuasions
of mine own unworthiness: which (undoubtedly) had put me to utter silence, had
I not been sustained both with the comfortable remembrance of your highness
clemency, and withal considered, that no gift may lightly be more acceptably
presented to ye head, then that, which wholly te^deth to the preservation of
the rest of the body. Of which sort, when I considered this History of
Plants to be, I feared the less to present it unto your Majesty. Knowing
that by your Princely cleme^cie ye same being received, and by your high
wisdom and authority allowed, shall take such place in your body politic, as
in the natural, those do that by the head (which by reasons rule governs the
whole) are known to be approved and condignely allowed. The second pricketh
me continually forward with this or the like persuasion: That as a thankeful
heart toward a natural mother cannot be better testified, then by love showed
and practiced toward her dear children: nor a more acceptable fruitfulness
be required of any one branche, then that which may redounde to the ornament of
the whole stock: so I in no wise should be more able to show my thankful
mind toward your highness (the most loving and tender mother of this common
Weal) then in publishing this history to yt benefit of your most loving
subjects, as being the best token of love and diligence that I am at this time
able to show unto either. And (doubtless if my skill in the translation were
answearable to the worthynesse either of the History it self, or of the
Authors thereof, I doubt not, but I should be thought to have honored your
Majesty with an acceptable present. As touching the worthiness of the
History it self, truly that thing may not justly be thought unmeet to be
offered unto a Prince, the knowledge whereof, beside that it is by daily
experience known to be both profitable to al, and pleasant to many, is above
al other faculties (the divine knowledge whereby the soul lives) only
excepted, with so high commendations in the holy Scriptures extolled, that not
only the professors thereof are accounted worthy of admiration and honor: but
eue^ Solomon that royal and wise King, for that he had the knowledge of the
natures of Plants, and was able to dispute thereof, from the highest to the
lowest, from the Cedar in Libanon to the Hysope that springs out of the wall,
is therefore in the sacred Bybel highly dignified and renowned. 1. Reg. 4.
I will say nothing of Mithridates, Lysimachus, Gentius, Artemisia, and such
noble and mighty Princes: whose delight and lyking toward this knowledge of
the nature of Plants was such, that as by their diligent inquisitio^ they
wittily found out the use of many of them, so, having found the same, they
disdayned not to denominate and imparte thereto their own names, which even to
this day many of them do still retain. But arguments to this purpose, are
before your most excellent Majesty needelesse to be alleged: as well because
your highness is daily co^uersant in the most clear light of al both divine and
humayne knowledge, whereby you far more easily see the whole compass, then
men of mean estate are able to conceive a part: as also for that the
professors of this faculty be with your highness had in such price and
estimation, that they are not only by your Majesty and your most noble
Progenitors, with sundry Privileges and liberties endowed, with many and great
stipendes and pentions in your Graces Universities and Schools fostered and
mainteyned: but also as they shall be found to have laudably profited therein,
so are they advanced and called to the charge of your person, and of the
persons of your Nobles. And art being by honor nourished, increases daily,
and puts al men out of doubt, that they which so embrace the professors
thereof, do both well like and think of the faculty, and sufficiently
understand both the use and the excellency thereof. As touching the Author
of this work which I have translated, how paineful a man he is, how skilful,
and how luckely he has achieved this his business, as it shalbest appear by
diligent reading over his works: so also may it easily be known by the
testimonies and judgments of the most learned Physicians of this age. Of
whom, some are by their own works already exta^t, notable and renowned, and
others (by the great travail that they have bestowed in translating him out of
his tongue wherein he wrote into diverse other languages) are made evident and
famous: but none before this into English. Which has made me desirous
(following their example) to make my Countrymen partakers of such knowledge, as
other learned and wise men in other Countries have thought meet to be made
known in the native tongues of their commonweals. Touching my self this
only I have to promise, that in this translation I have used my most skill and
diligence to please and pleasure al such as delight in this so honest and
profitable a knowledge. Most humbly crauyng a favorable acception hereof at
your Majesty's hands, and pardon, if any point I have given just occasion of
blame and deserved reprehension.

From my poor house at Lytescarie within your Majesty's County of Somerset,
the first day of January, M.D.Lxxviij. Your Majesty's most humble and
faithful subject, Henry Lyte.

To the friendly and indifferent Reader.
IF thou be ignorant (gentle Reader) and desirous to know, either how
profitable this History of Plants is, or how worthy to be studied, either how
hard and how highly in times past esteemed, what be the causes of the
hardness thereof, how they may be remedied, and why the Authors hereof (after
so many learned both ancient and late writers) took upon him the setting
forth of the same: or why in his Innotations and last edition he has revoked
certain things which in the first escaped him: for thy instruction and
resolution in these matters, I refer thee to the same Authors two Prefaces,
wherein he learnedly, and as briefly as the nature of the matters will permit,
discourses thereof sufficiently. But if thou would know of me, why I have
taken upon me the translation and publication of ye same in this our native
tongue, as I might without any great labor yield thee many just and reasonable
causes of my so doing, if I thought it greatly expedient or necessary so to
do: so I think it sufficient for any, whom reason may satisfy, by way of
answer to allege this action and sententions position: Bonum, quo communius,
eo melius and praestantius a good thing the more common it is, the better it
is. Seeing then yt my translation shall make this good and profitable history
(which hitherto has lien hid from many of my Countriemen, under the veil of
an unknown language) familiar and known unto them: and if it be good (as no
good man will deny) to enlarge a good thing, and to make many partakers
thereof: then can there not lack just cause to be alleged of this my doing:
neither think I, that any will mislike or repine thereat, except such, as
either envy the Weal of others whom they account simpler then them selves,
and therefore reckon unworthy to be in their own language made partakers
thereof: or else are so studious of their own private gain, that they fear,
least by this means some part thereof may be lessened: whiles others
understanding the nature and virtues of Plants and herbs, shall be the less
beholding to their scrupulous skill. But the good and virtuous Physician, whose
purpose is rather the health of many, then the wealth of him self, will not (I
hope) mislike this my enterprise, which to this purpose specially tends,
that even the meanest of my Countriemen (whose skill is not so profounde that
they can fetch this knowledge out of strange tongues, nor their ability so
wealthy, as to entertain a learned Physician) may yet in time of their
necessity, have some helps in their own, or their neighbors fields and
gardens at home. If perchance any list to pick a quarrel to my translation,
as not being either proper or not full, if I may obtain of him, to bear with
me til he him self shall have set forth a better, or til the next impression,
and the mean while (consydering that it is easier to reprehend a man's doings,
then to amend it) use me as a whet stone to further him self, I will not much
strive: for I seek not after vain glory, but rather how to benefit and
profit my Country. Fare well. (*)

GErmani fateor Dodoneo plurima debent,

IF all Dame Enuyes hateful brood hereat should hap to prye,
Or Momus in his cankred spite, should scowle with scoyning eye.
Yet Mawgre the^ this worthy work the Authors name shall raise,
And paynefull toil so well employed: shall reap renowned praise.
Not only he whose learned skyll and watchful pain first pende it,
And did with honor greet (in Douche) to Country his commend it:
But also he whose tender love to this his native soil,
For us his friends has first to take almost as great a toil,
A travel meet for Gentlemen and wightes of worthy fame:
Whereby great Princes heretofore have got immortal name.
As Gentius, Lysimachus, and also Mythridates,
With Iuba, Euax, Attalus, and Dioscorides.
And many noble wightes besides, and great renowned Kings,
Have so bewrayde their skyll in this (besides all other things)
By registring their names in Herbs, as though thereby they meant,
To testiyfe to all degrees their toil and travel spent
In such a noble faculty, was not a slauishe thing:
But fyt for worthy Gentlemen, and for a noble King.
For if by Herbs both health be had and sickness put to flight:
If health be that, without the which there can be no delight?
Who dare envy these worthy men, that have employde their pain,
To help the sore, to heal the sick, to raise the weak again?
No fie of that, but Dodoneus aye shall have his dew,
Whose learned skyll has offered first, this worthy work to vewe.
And Lyte whose toil has not been light, to dye it in this grain,
Deserves no light regard of us: but thanks and thanks again.
And sure I am, all English hearts that like of Physickes lore,
Will also like this Gentleman: and thank him much therefore.
VV. Clovves. FINIS.
To the Reader, in commendation of this work.
WHere virtue shines, and deeply seems to rest,
Where aid appears, to help the health of man,
Where perfect proof assigns us what is best,
Where counsel craves, each willing mind to skan,
Where learning lies to help us now and than:
There best is deemde for man to spend his days,
Though it be reapt with toyell ten thousand ways.
Then blame not him, whose careful hand first pende,
This worthy work, which now is brought to light,
But it embrace, and double thanks him lend,
Whose daily toil deserves the same by right:
For virtue shines herein to each man's sight.
Whose aid for health, with proof and counsel grave,
Whose learned lives, ought sure due praise to have.
Well: Rembert Dodoens, wrote this first in Douche.
Which since in French was turnde by others toil.
And now by Lyte: whose travail has been such.
For ease of all, within this native soil.
Where (lo) to Momus mates, he gives the foil.
And here presents in the English tongue,
To comfort all that are both old and young.
The work it self, of sundry trees entreat,
Besides of Herbs, Flowers, Weeds, and Plants that grows.
Setts down their virtues sure which are so great,
That we may say therein great learning flows.
The Author has (so far forth as he knows
By skillful Judgment) unto each disease,
Set down a cure, the sick and sore to ease.
Great was his toil, which first this work did frame.
And so was his, which ventred to translate it,
For when he had full finished all the same,
He minded not to add, nor to abate it.
But what he found, he meant whole to relate it.
Till Rembert he, did send additions store.
For to augment Lytes travel past before.
Which last supply so come to Lyte his hand,
He fitly furnished, every piece in place.
The work again he wrote I understand,
For fear if ought therein should breed disgrace.
And did as much as one could in this case.
For English names, to every herb and plant,
He added has, whereby is nothing skant.
This rare device, each one may well esteem,
Which brings aid, and comfort unto man.
The learned will accept the same I deem.
Wherefore I crave if ought epsy thou can,
(As none can be so watchful now and than
But faults may escape, for want of Argus eyes.)
To mende the same, and naught herein despise.
With willing mind, good Reader here I crave,
Accept this work, thus written for thy sake,
And honor him that seeks man's health to save.
Yielding him thanks, which it did undertake:
And unto Lyte due thanks thou have to make.
His paynefull pen deserves thy good report.
Whose toil was great, to end it in this sort.

REMBERTI DODONAEI AETA.XXXV. VIRTVTE AMBI.


REMBERTI DODONAEI MECHLINIENSIS MEDICI, IN SECVNDAM COMMENTARIORVM SVORVM, DE
STIRPIVM Historia, editionem, ad studiosos Medicinae Candidatos, Praefatio.
STIRPIVM ac vniuersae materiae Medicae cognitionem potentissimis Regibus,
antiquissimis Heroibus, Praestantissimis Medicis ac Philosophis olim in pretio
habitam, vtilem ac necessariam Medic arti iudicatam, sommo studio, nec minori
diligentia excultam, adeo manifestum est, vt multis assertionibus opus non sit.
Praesertim non paucis herbis Regum ac Heroum, qui has vel primi inuenerunt, vel
in frequenti medendi vsu habuerunt, nomina retinentibus, vt Mithridatium,
Eupatorium, Gentiana, Lysimachia, Achillea, Centaurium Alcibiadium, Telephium,
Arthemisia, aliaeque plures: and veteres ipsos, atque inter eos Hippocratem,
Medicorum omnium long principem, Galenum, no^nullosque alios, longinquas
peregrinationes, cognoscendae materiae Medicae causa suscepisse, and propria
and aliorum scripta testentur.

Eandem vero scientiam, a posteriorum nostroque tempore vicinorum seculorum
medicis ac philosophis, plane neglectam and contemptam fuisse, res ipsa quoque
euidenter docet. Solae enim illae Medicinae parts, ab illorum seculorum
Medicis coli visae sunt, quae ex rationum physicarum fontibus deductae, hinc
dubitandi disputandique vberem materiam praeberent: aliae vero, vsu atque
experientia constantes, vt steriles ac ieiunae spretae. Cuiusmodi ipsa (...)
est, Physicarum rationum subsidiam vel nullum vel exiguu^ admittens. Quamobrem
eius omni notitia, mulieribus, herbarijs analphabetis, vel indoctis
pharmacopoeis relicta, indignum professione sua ac magnificis titulis parum
decorum infoelices illi Medici existimabant, cognoscendae alicuius materiae
medicae herb aut stirpis causa, vel minimum operae laborisque sumere: extra
vrbes ad montes, conualles, prata, suburbanaque loca excurrere.

Tantam studiorum dissimilitudinem, fatalis ille seculorum ordo peperit, qui
and maximas vrbes, potentissima regna, latissime patentia imperia, and hanc
Medicinae partem, nonnullasque alias pessundedit, ac propemodum extinxit. Vnde
factum, vt quae olim facillime, ac nullo propemodum negocio materiae Medicae ac
Stirpium cognito percipi poterat, difficilis ac obscura reddita sit.

Tradebant eam Dioscorides, Galenus, eiusque aetatis Medici, veluti per manus a
matoribus acceperant, seruatis eousque nominibus, quae magna ex part
incorrupta ad illorum tempora venerant.

Nobis ea foelicitas denegata, multis modis veris ac genuinis appellationibus,
corruptis, peruersis fere abolitis, barbaris in earum locum suppositis, multo
tempore intermissa Stirpium notitia, solis veterum descriptionibus relictis, ex
quibus hc disciplina and requirenda and restituenda est. Id quam difficile sit,
licet alio loco scripserimus, tamen hic repetere visum fuit non alienum.

Non leuis autem difficultatis huius scienti, aut vna aliqua causa est, sed
maxim eaeque praecipuae du: innumera videlicet multitudo stirpiu^, immensaque
varietas: and eoru^ qui de harum historia, aut materia Medica scripta
reliquerunt, breuitas, incuria, negligentia, subinde varia atque dissimilis
apud diuersos descriptio: and vtina^ non quorunda^ errores obscuritatem no^
exiguam in ea^ intulissent.

Stirpium siquidem herbarumque infinita sunt genera, vary per orbem terrarum
sparsa immensa multitudo, vt non vno loco paucisque regionibus requirere eas
liceat, sed ad eas omnes cognosce^das omnium sere regnoru^ ac prouinciaru^
peragratione, longi temporis peregrinatione opus videatur. Sunt nonnullae
quibusdam vel insulis dicatae vel regionibus propriae, quae in alia quaeuis
loca transferri nequeunt, vel tellure coeloque mutatis muta^tur, vt
Theophrastus libro quarto ait. Ali pluribus quidem terris communes, non omnes
tamen passim aut crebro obui, sed certis tractubus peculiares, vel montibus
scilicet, promontorijs, praeruptis rupibus, saxosis aut niualibus locis,
collibus, densis syluis, vmbrosis lucis, arborum caudicibus, aruis,
campestribus, apricis, laeto pioguique solo, macro and sterili, humidis,
vliginosis, riguis, paludibus, stagnantibus aquis, fontibus, fluminibus,
fluuiorum ripis, maris littoribus, scopulis, vel ipso denique mari addictae.
Harum autem istae eandem fere vbique formam retinent, vel eriguam mutationem
assumunt: illae in diuersis regionibus pro coeli solique varietate, aliam
formam and magnitudinem induunt. Quod segetum, fabaru, nucum, aliorumque apud
Indos nascentium (si Herodoto fides) exemplis manifestum est, quorum long
mayor magnitudo, quam in Aegypto nascentium. Segetum enim culmi instar
harundinum crassescunt: fabae triplo maiores Aegyptijs, sesamum miliumque
eximiae magnitudinis: nuces tantae molis vt miraculi loco in templis
suspendantur. Strabo quoque in extremo Mauritanorum quoda^ tractu, iuxta
creditum Nili exortum vitem tantae crassitudinis nasci tradit, quam vix duo
homines complecti queant: omnem herbam cubitalem: Staphylinorum, Hippomarathri,
Solymi caules duodenum cubitorum, crassitudine quatuor palmorum reperiri. Et
ta^tus quidem Stirpium numerus immensa latissime sparsa multitudo, varia ac
multiplex natura.

Auctorum vero ipsorum quanta fuerit negligentia, vel incuria in multarum
praesertim vulgo notarum, formis differentijsque describendis, cum multarum
extent nomina, quarum formae non sunt expressae, aut leuiter tantum descript,
nemo fere est qui ignoret, Ruellio idipsum scriptis suis testante.

Eosdem vero non semper conuenire, atque interdum inter sese dissidere, dum sub
vno eodemque nomine alius aliam herbam vel fruticem designat, vel eandem alia
nomenclatura exprimit, Dioscoridis cum Theophrasti aliorumque scriptis diligens
collatio ostendit, suppeditabit and huius varietatis Historia nostra non pauca
exempla.

Descriptiones vero quoru^dam erroribus esse conspersas, quod ad Plinianas
attinet manifestissimum est, Leoniceni enim libri de Plinij erratis passim
prostant, and omnes fere nostri seculi, qui de materia Medica aut Stirpibus
scripsere, in redarguendis ac notandis Plinij lapsubus plurimi sunt.

Verum de Dioscoride id nemo forsitan expectauerit aut suspicatus fuerit,
Galeni testimonio atque scriptis commendato. Reperiuntur tamen in eius
commentarijs no^ exigui errores. Alias enim dissimilium Stirpium, eiusdem apud
diuersos auctores nominis, delineationes in vnam historiam contrahit: alias
eandem non ijsdem nominibus nuncupatam, veluti membratim diuulsam diuersis
locis describit, vt ijs commentarijs quos in Stirpium historias, quae apud
Dioscoridem extant meditamur, ostensuros (si Deus vitam, valerudinem, ociumque
concesserit) nos speramus.

Nec tamen hi errores impediunt, quo minus*Dioscorides alijs omnibus long
praestet, cum omnes vel imperfectiorem multo historia, vel pluribus, maioribus
erroribus, ac fabulis, prstigijsque plena scripta reliquerint. Theophrastus
reliquos omnes in suo scribendi genere superans, formas ex professo non
descripsit, sed Stirpium multiplicem differentiam aliaque philosopho homine
digna prosequi staduit. De Plinij scriptis quid iudicandum, iam scripsimus.
Nicandri, (...) solum reperiuntur. Apuleius de paucis ta^tummodo egit. Galenus,
Paulus Aetius, figuras a Dioscoride expressas omiserunt. Alij veteres Graeci
and Latini, Philosophi, Medici, Poetae, Historiographi, Architecti,
Agriculturae scriptores, Hippiatri five Veterinarij, quorum lectione ad
quarandam plantarum notitiam peruenimus, non nisi obiter quarundam neminerunt.
Bithyni Iolae, Heraclidis Tarentini, Crateuae herbarij, Andreae medici, Iulij
Bassi, Nicerati, Petronij Nigri, Diodoti, Pamphyli, Mant^, Apollonij

neque perfectum aliquid tradiderunt. Plerique horum anilibus fabulis aut
prstigiaturis Aegyptijs, coniurationibusue pleni sunt, alij de vna aliqua
materia, aut paucis tantum, vt Galenus scribit, egerunt: vniuersam vero
materiam complecti non studuerunt.

Quibus de causis illorum omnium scriptis posthabitis, vni Dioscoridi summam
laudem auctoritatemque Galenus tribuit, quam illi quoque deberi nemo negare
potest, absque eius siquidem scriptis, Stirpium materique Medicae cognitio
resti tui nulla ratione potest.

Non enim idcirco veluti parum vtilis abdicandus aut reijciendus, quod in
plerisque locis lapsus fit, cum nec Plinium muito grauius and pueriliter spe
hallucinatum minime negligi oporteat ad Stirpium notitiam plurimum conferentem.
Neque enim eam ob causam de erratis eius coepimus admonere, sed vt huius
scienti and studij difficultas ab omnibus intelligatur maioriqueue cum
attentione, in stirpium cognitione^ studiosi incumbant: diligentius omnes notas
expendant: leuibus coniecturis contenti facile iudicium non promant, minus
admirentur si post complures in hoc studio versatos, multa in notitiam nondu^
perducta adhuc lateant: plures quotidie exoriantur in restituenda hac Medicinae
part laborantes, aut quod hi qui in lucem subinde nonnulla dedere, sententiam
alicubi mutent. Nam haec omnia, haud dubio, difficultati huius scientiae magis,
quam negligenti, incuriae, aut temeritati huius aetatis scriptorum accepta
refer aequum est.

Si enim Dioscorides exercitatissimus vir, qui multum studij, laboris, in
Stirpium, materiaeque Medicae cognitionem impendit, eo seculo quo nomina magna
ex part incorrupta vulgo retinebantur, ipsarum notitia a maioribus accepta
veluti per manus tradebatur, vel immenso numero, multiplicique earum varietate,
vel auctorum imperfectis, varijs, fabulosis descriptionibus detentus, errorem
vitare non potuit: qua ratione nunc quisquam, antiquis nomenclaturis ac
appellationibus vix receptis, aut plurimum deprauatis, Stirpium cognitione
longo tempore intermissa atque contempta, in tanta veterum (vti diximus)
negligentia, incuria, varietate, atque erroribus subinde implicata obscuritate,
vel facile vel absque magno labor, diligentissima inquisitione earum notitiam
consequi se posse sperabit?

Quum igitur tanta huius scientiae vel magnitudo vel difficultas sit, vt non
nisi diligentissimo omnium stirpium maturoque examine plurimorum veterum
auctorum lectione exactissima, id est, multo labor, diutinis
peregrinationibus, continuo studio comprehendi queat: ac fieri vix possit, vt
his omnibus, vnius hominis aut paucorum vita diligentiaque par sit. Citra omnem
admirationem esse debet, post multos recentiorum in hac materia diligenter
versatos, alios indies exoriri, qui ha^c augere studiant, and nostros quoque de
Stirpium historia libros prodire.

Nemine siquidem hanc scientiam ad perfectionem perducente, sed omnibus plurima
praetermittentibus, occasio posteris relinquitur, priorum inuentis ac
obseruatis plurima adijciendi atque stirpium cognitionem locupletandi. Quod
recentiorum non paucis praestantibus, priuato studio, peregrinatione, aliaue
occasion comperta in commune proferentibus and mei officij fore iudicaui, vt
eam quam existimabam me huic scienti posse accessionem facere, aut emendationem
adhibere, in publicum mitterem, atque verae Medicinae Stirpiumque studiosis
communicarem.

Non frustra autem vel inutiliter hunc laborem vel recentiores vel nos
suscepimus. Pertinet enim hc scientia ad praecipuas and principes duas Medicin
parts (...). Illa victus ratione: haec medicamentis sanitati homiuis consulit:
vtraque herbis, frugibus, stirpibus, earumque seminibus, fructibus, radicibus,
succis, veluti necessarijs and materia and instrumentis vtitur. Haec enim vt
plurimum, ad artis opera Medici vel impermixta, vel alijs aut interse commixta
adhibent. Si enim nemo illum bonum fabrum aut artificem dixerit, qui malleum,
incudem aut ferrum, aliave artis suae instrumenta vel materiam no^ nouerit:
Medicum quis habebit doctum, qui Betam a Blito distinguere nesciat, in crassa
supinaque omnium Stirpium Medicaeque materiae ignorantia versetur.

At multum, fortasse dicet aliquis, inter medicum and reliquos artifices
interest, neque enim manum medici operibus apponunt, sed veluti architecti
tantum praecipiunt, omnem Stirpium and Medicae materiae notitiam,
praeparationem, variam mistionem pharmacopoeis relinquunt.

Fatemur a multis annis medicos praeparandorum miscendorumque pharmacorum morem
omisisse, ac a veterum consuetudine recessisse, quos abunde constat nulla
pharmacopoeorum opera vsos, medicamenta etiam proprijs and discipulorum manibus
miscuisse, neque vt pharmaco poei rursus fiant requirimus, and quaerendis,
terendis, tundendis, praeparandis, miscendis, medicamentis occupentur, sed
Stirpium and materi Medicae, quarum potissimum frequentior ac quotidianus vsus,
notitiam exigimus: non secus ac in Architecto omnis materiae aedificiorum
cognitio requiritur. Qui enim eam ignorauerit, bonus Architectus esse non
potest. Sic etiam neque doctus aut perfectus medicus, qui artis suae materiam
non cognorit. Quod si fabri ex non conuenienti ligno vel trabes vel aedium
contignationes struant, Latomi luto pro caemento parietes compingant aut
reliqui artifices alijs modis imposturas moliantur, admittet aut dissimulabit
haec bonus Architectus? Non existimo quenquam fore, qui non putet harum rerum
curam ad eum pertinere. Cur igitur conniuebit Medicus, si pharmaco poeus spuria
legitimis genuinis adulterata recentibus exoleta, calida frigidis, frigida
calidis, alexi pharmacis deleteria substituat, ac deficiente vno, alias hoc,
modo illud, absque vllo iudico aut delectu supponat? Conniuere autem cum
huiusmodi imposturis aut grauissimis erratis oportebit, si huius scientiae
rudis imperitus fuerit, cum nulla ratione dolum deprehendere poterit.

Omnes igitur Medicinae studiosos in hac Stirpium materiaeque Medicae notitia
sese exercere conuenit, atque operam and diligentiam summam adhibere, vt harum
cognitionem reliquis Medic artis partibus adiungant: veterum antiquissimorum,
probatissimorumque Medicorum huius scientiae studiosissimorum, vestigijs hac in
part insista^t, ac Galeni clarissimi and maxim auctoritatis medici, praeceptis
and consilio obsequundent, qui omnes Medicos and iuuenes artis candidatos ad
Stirpium and Medicamentorum materiae exactam notitiam admonet, atque incitat,
Medicus (inquit libro de antidotis primo) omnium Stirpium, si fieri potest,
peritiam habeat, consulo: sin minus, plurium saltem quibus frequenter vtimur.
Item tertio de Medicamentis secundum genera. Hinc puto bon indolis iuuenes
incitatum iri, vt medicamentorum materiam cognoscant, ipsimet inspicientes, non
semel aut bis, sed frequenter, quoniam sensibilium rerum cognitio sedula
inspectione perficitur. Et ibidem paulo infra: Vos ergo admoneo amici, vt in
hoc quoque me sequamini si artis opera pulchre obiri velitis. Nouistis enim
quomodo ex omni natione, praestantissima quotannis medicamenta mihi adferantur,
eo quod perditi illi omnigerarum rerum coemptores (Grci (...) vocant) varijs
modis ea contaminant. Prstiterat fortassis non hos solum, sed multo magis etiam
mercatores, qui illa aduehunt, incusare: atque his multo magis ipsos herbarios:
item nihil minus eos, qui radicum liquores, succos, fructus, flores and germina
ex montibus in vrbes conferunt. Hi siquidem omnium primi in eis dolum exercent.
Quisquis igitur auxiliorum vndique copiam h^bere volet, omnis materiae
Stirpium, animalium and metallorum, tum aliorum terrestrium corporum, quae ad
Medicinae vsum ducimus, expertus edo, vt ex eis and exacta and notha cognoscat.
Deinde in commentario meo, quem de simplicium medicamentorum facultate prodidi,
sese exerceat. Nisi enim hoc modo instructus ad praesentis operis praesidia
veniat, verbotenus quidem medendi methodum sciet, opus vero nullum ipsa dignum
perficiet. Hactenus Galeni verba. Ex quibus manifestum est ac indubitatum
relinquitur, hanc scientiam medico and vtilem, and necessariam, vt qui absque
huius peritia nihil poscit medendo certi assequi, aut eximium quicquam ex art
praestare, herbariorum, myropolarum, pharmacopoeorumque dolis, imposturis, ac
subinde crassa vel pertinaci ignorantia delusus. Quod omnes medicos
diligentissime cauere cum salutis ac valetudinis suae fidei concreditorum, tum
propriae existimationis causa, maxim decet.

Neque scientiae huius difficultas, quae ipsius pene immensam magnitudinem
ostendit, quenquam ab eius studio absterrere debet, sed potius ad auxiliares ei
manus conferendas omnes studiosos excitare, accendere, inflammare: ne tam
necessaria humanae vitae scientia diutius vel neglecta, vel contempta iaceat,
sed plurimorum communi labor atque diligentia crescens, ad perfectionem
veniat, ab interitu vindicetur, medicinaeque reliquis partibus adiungatur, ac
veluti postliminio restituatur. Quo enim difficultatis ac magnitudinis scientia
aliqua amplius habet, hoc magis bona ingenia in ea occupari libentius solent.
Ignauorum existimatur in paruis ac facilibus versari: industrioru^ vero ac
diligentu^ in grauibus, magnis, ac difficilibus. Paru ac faciles res nulli
opinionem aut auctoritatem pariunt. Difficiles and magn, honores and gloria^
conferunt. Magnae enim rei, quantumcunque quis possederit, participem fieri,
non minima est gloria, vt Columella ait.

Sed vt ad hos de Stirpium commentarios veniamus. Contraxeramus in hos, quum
primu^ ederemus, quicquid herbarum plantarumque in cognitionem nostram venerat.
Secunda hac editione seuera animaduersione adhibita, omnia recognouimus,
pleraque mutauimus, nonnulla translulimus, totum opus non exigua accessione
locupletauimus and auximus, multarum Stirpium nemini quod sciam adhuc
depictarum imagines adiecimus. Vtrobique formas omnium, qua potuimus diligentia
tradidimus: nomina Graeca, Latina, officinis recepta, Germanica, Gallica, and
nobis Braba^tis ac vicinis Fla^dris aut Hollandis Frisiisve vernacula,
singularum historijs adscripsimus. Temperamenta deinde ac vires ex
probatissimorum Medicorum scriptis subi^nximus, haud praeteritis ijs quae
recentiorum experientia repperit, maxim earum quas in veterum cognitionem non
venisse neo terici putant. Atque haec omnia breuissime complectentes non
elementoru^ ordine stirpes digessimus, sed vel forma, vel viribus, vel alia
ratione congeneres ac similes coniungere studuimus.

His autem describendis non tantum nostro studio vel, si qu est, industria
profecimus, sed antecessorum quoque scriptis plurimum adiuti sumus, Leoniceni
videlicet, Hermolai, Manardi, Ruellij. Cordi vtriusque, Hieronymi Tragi,
aliorumque. Leonharti Fuchsij imagines in priores nostros magna ex part omnes
recepimus (vt in ipsa imaginu^ nostraru^ prima editione adiecta causa
scripsimus) non sic tamen vt sententiam eius in omnibus sequeremur, sed
adhibito iudicio and animaduersione, verisimiliorem amplecteremur.

In recognoscendis vero and noua accessione augmentandis, licet nostro labor
plurimu^ creuerint, non tamen Petri Bellonij obseruationibus profecisse nos
inficiari possumus: aut ex Petri Andreae Matthioli commentarijs quaedam
mutuatos. Quibus tamen multum pepercimus, propterea quod eae, quas reliquimus,
in conspectum nostrum non venissent. Annisi enim sumus ad hoe, vt vix alias
describeremus, quam oculis nostris aliquando subiectas and conspectui
exhibitas. Itaque paucissimas ex eius commentarijs accepimus, idque fere non
absque eius mentione, qu videlicet propter nature affinitatem, vel nominis
similitudinem cum alijs a nobis descriptis, negligi vix poterant: vel in
opinione apud nostros sic versabantur, vt aliena pro veris supponerentur. Quod
si autem quae aliae sunt nobis cum Matthiolo communes, eas nostra cura depictas
fuisse, figurae magna ex part aliae, atque vernaculi commentarij prius quam
Matthioli ad nos venirent editi, facile testabuntur. Nec defuit nobis
locupletandis nostris Doctiss. Andreas Lacuna, qui Corrudam and Palmam in opus
nostrum intulit Profuit etiam industria Caroli Clusij cognitioni vniuersae
materiae Medicae, tum ipsius artis studiosiss. qui and raras quasdam stirpes
nobis suppeditanit, and conuertendis commentarijs hisce in Gallicum Idioma,
benignam ac diligentem suam operam exhibuit.

Reliquum est studiosi inuenes, vt nostris hisce commentarijs, cum in Stirpium
herbarumque cognitione facilius assequenda adiuti, tum huius scientic and
Medicinae partis non minim, vtilitate necessitateque prouocati, excitatis,
accensis, inflammatis animis, omni studio in hoc diligentissime incumbatis, vt
non solum quae a nobis descriptae sunt, ac per icones expressae stirpes, in
notitiam vestram veniant, verum etiam earum quae apud veteres supersunt, nondum
satis notarum, ac vniuersae materiae Medicae peritiam assequamini, vel saltem
auctarium aliquod hactenus repertis ac traditis adijciatis, quo multorum
communi studiomaius ac maius incrementum haec scientia accipiens, ad (...)
tandem ac perfectionem perueniat.

EPISTOLA AD LECTOREM. REMBERTI DODONAEI DE RECOGNITIONE SVORVM COMMENTARIORVM
AD LECTORES EPISTOLA CVM imaginum eius part altera olim edita.
FVTV. RVM omnino auguror candide Lector, vt simul ac nasutiores and morosiores
aliqui, nostros de re Herbaria commentarios aut imagines viderint, studium
statim nostrum sint suggillaturi: quod post tam multos doctos viros, in hoc
studij genere summa cum dilige^tia versatos, melius me aliquid inuenire, and
eorum inuentis superaddere, posse sperauerim. Vbi vero in annotationes
inciderint, quas hoc loco adiecimus, and in ijs quaedam retractata, nonnulla in
dubium reuocata a nobis offenderint, multo magis temeritatem nostram sint
damna^turi: vt qui mox ab editione, aliam sententiam in nonnullis sequar, vel
non satis perspecta atque comperta in publicum dare voluerim. His responsum
cupio, huic studio hoc vnice proprium esse multorum operam atque laborem
desiderare: nempe in quo non exigua sit difficultas, nec minor varietas, quae
summam etiam diligentissimorum industriam fatigent. Infinita enim sunt stirpium
qu vel sine nominibus, vel cum barbaris and peregrinis nobis sese offerunt
genera, quibus vetera and antiqua reddere nomina instituti nostri praecipua and
maxima pars est. Quarum etsi veteres Herbariae rei and stirpium historiae
scriptores, differentias ac notas omnes, summa diligentia descriptas nobis
reliquissent, impossible tamen foret, de omnibus facile aut citra summum
laborem and indefessum studium, veritatem assequi, cum non vno loco, sed per
vniuersum orbem spersas requirere and cognoscere oporteret. Non vno enim loco
aut eadem in regione omnes pluresue, sed aliae alijs vel regionibus vel locis
addictae sunt. Dictamnum Cretae proprium est. Rha supra Bosphorum regiones and
paucae ali suppeditant. Thus Sabaeorum gignit prouincia. Balsamum sola
Palestina producit. Et vt plures tales regionibus quibusdam solis proprias
praetereamus, ex his qu in pluribus terris inueniuntur, nonnullae nisi in
co^ualibus proueniunt: sunt aliae montibus familiares and propriae. Amant hae
aprica loca: illa vmbrosa aut densas syluas. Inter saxa, lapidosis locis aut in
praeruptis rupibus reperiuntur quaedam: aliae inarborum caudicibus nascuntur.
Laetum pinguaeque solum desiderant nonnullae: in sterili agro magis proficiunt
aliae. Delectant quasdam arua: alias vineta: illas horti: istas prata:
nonnullae in vliginosis and riguis oriuntur. Sunt quas temere alio loco quam in
maris littoribus requiras. Ad quas omnes cognoscendas and perquirendas cum
prter diligentem veterum lectionem, diuturna and longi temporis per infinita
loca, per omnes fere orbis parts peregrinatione opus sit, multi labores
sudoresque perferendi, infinita pericula subeunda, fieri non potest, vt vna
hominis vita his ombus satis sit, vt interim omittamus quam multa superueniunt
incommoda, quae peregrinandi occasionem aut adimunt aut multum impediunt,
veluti bella incogniti diuersarum gentium, ritus, mores and lingua, horrid,
incultae, squalidae regiones, and ad haec maxim reru^ vel publicaru^, vel
priuatarum and domesticarum curatio, aut ferendis maximis sumptibus impar
fortuna. Nunc autem cum his omnibus grauissimis impedimentis, accedat etiam,
quod veteres multarum stirpium veluti vulgo cognitarum formas non expresserint:
aliarum tam leuiter descripserint: vel attigerint, vt non videantur tradidisse:
iam and in nonnullarum descriptionibus non vulgares sed maximi auctores
varient, veluti in Asphodelo and alijs quibusdam, quis non summam in hac
disciplina difficultatem esse affirmet, quae multorum quantumuis industriorum
and studiosorum indefessos labores and maximam diligentiam requirat? nec solum
requirat verum etiam superet? Cum igitur tam infinita stirpium sunt genera,
singulorumque multiplices differentiae, tam diuersa and natura and situ
dissidentia in quibus gignuntur loca, qu adire omnia non solum difficile verum
etiam impossible fuerit, and ad haec mutil, imperfectae ac confusae veterum
descriptiones, vt propter haec grauissima impedimenta, de absoluta stirpium
cognitione desperandum videatur. Nulla certe prsentior via, commodior ratio,
aut expeditius consilium, quo hoc studium, haec scientia in lucem reuocari and
crescere possit, quam vt multorum laboribus and lucubrationibus adiuuetur.
Plurimorum enim poterit industria quod paucorum nequit praestare opera. Dum
enim hic quaedam in lucem adfert, alij quaedam adijciunt, nonnulla corrigunt,
alia supplent, non exiguum herbarum studium and simplicis medicinae cognitio
incrementem capit Hanc rationem videntur mihi insequuti Leonicenus, Manardus,
Ruellius, Cordus vterque, Musa, Tragus, Fuchsius, and quotquot in hac
disciplina non omnino infoeliciter hac tate versantur, Neque enim quisquam
istorum, aut stirpium historiam absoluit, aut perfectam sibi eius cognitionem
vendicat: cum multas etiam de industria prtereant. Sed quod quisque sibi suo
labor, sua industria per ocium peperit peregrinatione inuenit, aut alia
ratione cognouit, hoc in commune proferre, and veritatis amatoribus communicare
studet, and quo quisque posterior hoc maiorem huic scientiae accessionem facit,
dum antecessorum opera ac laboribus etia^ adiuuatur. Mouit certe nos and hc
ratio, cum enim multas stirpes in omnibus recentioribus desiderari
animaduertissem, in quibusdam deceptos eos obseruassem, and non paucas me
supplere and aliorum inuentis adijcere, nec non in quibus erratum videbatur,
veritatem aperire posse sperassem, volui vt post multorum doctorum virorum qui
in Stirpium historia versati sunt commentarios, mei quoque labores, mei
conatus, in publicum prodirent, non quod laudem ac gloriam mihi hinc aliquam
postulem, sed vt nostris inuentis and studijs aliquo etiam modo, stirpium
herbarumque cognitio and simplicis medicine studium promoueatur. Desinant
igitur morosi censores, frustra aut temere hunc laborem a nobis susceptum
criminari, quando nostra industria and opera huic scientiae non mediocris
plantarum, fruticum ac arborum numerus accesserit, antea a nemine quod sciam,
recentiorum traditarum, praeter omnes qu ab errore vindicatae sunt quarum non
exiguus quoque numerus est. Quod vero paucula quaedam, post editos commentarios
a nobis retractentur, facit summa huius scientiae and maxima, vt diximus,
difficultas, quae nos ita tenet Cimmerijs quasi tenebris immersos, vt vix etiam
summo studio, and frequenti ipsarum plantarum collatione, veritatem queamus
inuenire. Si enim in ijs scientijs aut artibus (vt Socrates alicubi inquit)
errores etiam subinde committantur, quae vel ex naturalium rationum fontibus
deducuntur, vel certis praeceptionibus, regulis aut methodo constant, quo non
tandem modo, in Herbaria disciplina, nullis regulis, nulla methodo firmata, ex
naturalibus rationibus minimum, imo pene nullum subsidium admittente, saepius
and nolentibus, and non sentientibus nobis errores irrepent? Doce^t id scripta
Leoniceni, Hermolai, Manardi, Cordi, Ruellij, Musae, Tragi, Fuchsij and aliorum
recentiorum, quorum iudicia vel a seipsis saepius reuocata, vel ab alijs
retractata and correcta sunt. Non reputo me his diuiniorem, and ego homo sum,
decipi and errare possum, praesertim in re tam multis de causis difficili ac
obscura, vt si alicubi ferendus aut dissimilandus est error, hic dissimulari
and tolerari debeat. Quamobrem non tam pudet nos horum errorum, quam poenitet.
Quando igitur mihi hoc commune cum alijs est, vt in quibusdam minus veritatem
assequutus fuerim, non habeo aliud praesentius remedium, quam vt mihi ipsi
medear meosque errores ipse e medio sustollam. Et praestat sane me mei ipsius
correctorem esse, quouis alio, quamuis and aliorum animaduersiones non nisi
aequissimo animo accepturus sum. Cum enim publicae vtilitatis causa hunc
laborem susceperim, and eiusdem intersit sicubi a me erratum, idipsum corrigi
ac notari, nulla in re magis mihi gratificari poterunt veritatis studiosi, quam
si nostra omnia ad examen ducant, cumque veterum descriptionibus diligenter
conferant, ac vbi me veritatem minus assequutum deprehenderint, amice and
synceriter admoneant. Atqui sic morosis and seueris istis censoribus responsum
esto, quos optauerim ab ista calumniandi tentigine, and doctorum huius seculi
scriptorum, suggillandi and reprehendi studio, ad meliorem frugem, and bonarum
artium ac scientiarum studia conuersos in hoc totos esse, and omnibus ingenij
viribus certare, vt, vel mediocris eruditionis viros, doctrina aequent, si
superare se posse diffidant. Caeterum quod ad annotationes istas attinet,
sequuti in his sumus, secundam commentariorum nostrorum editionem, quam ob
causam quaedam retract^uimus, de nonnullis videlicet aliter iudicantes, de
alijs vel nostram vel aliorum huius aetatis doctorum virorum coniecturam
indicantes: vnum aut alterum Dioscoridis locum aut vitiosum aut confusum
ostendimus: figuras complures adiecimus, omnes videlicet quae secundae ac
posteriori aeditioni accesserunt. Sunt autem ex his non paucae quidem nouae, id
est, antea aut prius non depict: nonnullae infeliciter prius expressae, nunc
aedificiosius and elegantius formatae paucissim ex Doctiss. Pet. And. Matthioli
commentarijs translatae, quas nempe cognatio vel similitudo cum alijs a nobis
descriptis, non sinebat praetermitti, vt etiam in commentariorum nostrorum
praefatione scripsimus, Nam a reliquis, quas forte alius in suos commentarios
traduxisset propterea abstinuimus, quod in conspectum nostrum non venissent.
Illud enim nobis in primis cur fuit, vt quam paucissimas describeremus, quas
non aliquando oculis coram cernere contigit, and maxima nouarum figurarum pars
ad viuarum plantarum imitationem depingeretur, vt ipsae stirpium descriptiones,
and imagines ali nec aliorum similes facile testabuntur.

Vale, atque prsentibus fruere, dum succisiuis horis ocium nacti, alia, his
locupletiora, meditamur. ()
APPENDIX. De his qui Latin vsus Herbarum scripserunt, and quando ad Romanos
notitia earum peruenerit. Item de Herbarum inuentione, and antiqua medicina,
and quare hodie minus exerceantur earum remedia, ex Plinij lib. 25. cap. 2.
MINVS hoc quam par erat, nostri celebrauere, omnium vtilitatum and virtutum
rapacissimi. Primusque and diu solus idem ille M. Cato, omniu^ bonarum artium
magister, paucis duntaxat attigit. Boum etiam medicamina non omissa. Post eum
vnus illustrium tentauit C. Valgius, eruditione spectatus, imperfecto volumine
ad diuum Augustum, inchoata etiam praefatione religiosa, vt omnibus malis
humanis illius potissimum principis semper medicetur maiestas. Ante condiderat
solus apud nos, quod equidem inueni, Pompeius, Lenaeus, Magni Pompei libertus,
quo primum tempore hanc scientiam ad nostros peruenisse animaduerto. Nam quam
Mithridates, maximus sua aetate regum, quem debellauit Pompeius, omnium ante se
genitorum diligentissimus vit fuisse argumentis prterquam fama intelligitur.
Vni ei excogitatum, quotidie venenum bibere, praesumptis remedijs, vt
consuetudine ipsa innoxium fieret. Primo inuenta genera antidoti, ex quibus
vnum etiam nomen eius retinet. Illius inuentum autumant, sanguinem anatum
Ponticarum miscere antidotis, quoniam veneno viuerent. Ad illum Asclepiadis
medendi art clari, volumina composita extant, cum sollicitatus ex vrbe Roma,
praecepta pro se mitteret. Illum solum mortalium Mithridaten. 22. linguis
locutum certum est: Mithridates.
nec de subiectis ge^tibus vllum hominem per interpretem appellatum ab eo annis
56. quibus regnauit. Is ergo in reliqua ingenij magnitudine medicin
peculiariter curiosus, ab hominibus subiectis, qui fuere pars magna terrarum,
singula enquirens, scrinium commentationu^ harum and exemplaria, effectusque in
arcanis suis reliquit. Pompeius autem omni regia praeda potitus, transfer ea
sermon nostro libertum suum Lomaeum, grammatice artis doctissimum, iussit:
vitaeque ita profuit non minus quam reipublicae victoria illa. Praeter hos
Graeci auctores medicin prodidere, quos suis locis diximus. Ex his Euax rex
Arabum, Euax.
quid de simplicium effectibus ad Neronem scripsit: Crateias, Dionysius,
Metrodorus oro^ne blandissima, sed qua nihil pene aliud quam rei difficultas
intelligatur. Pinxere namque effigies herbarum, atque scripsere effectus. Verum
and pictura fallax est ex coloribus tam numerosis, praesertim in aemulatione
naturae, multumque degenerat transcribentium sors varia. Praeterea parum est
singulas earum aetates pingi, cum quadripartitis varietatibus anni faciem
mutent. Quare caeteri sermon eas tradidere. Aliqui effigy quidem indicata,
and nudis quidem plaerumque nominibus defuncti: quoniam satis videbatur,
potestates vimque demonstrare quaerere volentibus. Nec est difficile cognitu.
Nobis certe, exceceptis admodum paucis, contigit reliquas contemplari scientia
Antonij Castoris, cui summa auctoritatis erat in ea art nostro aeuo, visendo
hortulo eius in quo plurimas alebat: Antonius Castor.
centesimum aetatis annum excedens, nullum corporis malum expertus, ac ne
aetate quidem memoria, aut vigore concus^is. Nec aliud mirata magis antiquitas
reperietur. Inuenta iampridem ratio est praenuncians horas, non modo dies ac
noctes, solis lunaeque defectum. Durat tamen tradita persuasio in magna part
vulgi, veneficijs and herbis id cogi^in eo namque soeminarum scientiam
praeualere. Certe quid non repleuere fabulis Colchis Medea, alique, imprimisque
Italica Circe, dijs etiam adscripta? Vnde arbitror natum, vt Aeschylus e
vetustissimis in poeticare, refertam Italiam herbarum potentia proderet
Multique Circaeios agros, vbi habitauit illa, in magno argumento etiamnum
durante in Marsis, a filio eius orta genere, quos esse domitores serpentium
constat. Homerus.
Homerus quidem primus doctrinarum and antiquitatis parens, multus alias in
admiratione Circes, gloriam herbarum Aegypto tribuit, tum etiam cum rigaretur
Aegyptus illa, non autem esset, postea fluminis limo inuecta. Herbas certe
Aegyptias a regis vxore traditas suae Helenae plurimas narrat, ac nobile illud
Nepenthes, obliuionem tristitiae veniamque afferens, and ab Helena vtique
omnibus mortalibus propinandum. Primus autem omnium quos memoria nouit, Orpheus
de his herbis curiosius aliqua prodidit. Post eum musaeus and Haesiodus Polion
herbam in quantum mirati sunt, diximus. Orpheus and Hesiodus suffitiones
commendauere. HOMERVS and alias nominatim herbas celebrat, quas suis locis
dicemus. Ab eo Pythagoras clarus sapientia, primus volumen de earum effectu
composuit: Apollini, Aesculapioque, and in totum dijs immortalibus inuentione
and origin assignata: composuit and DEMOCRITVS, ambo peragratis Persidis,
Arabiae, Aethiopiae, Aegyptique magis. Adeoque ad haec attonita antiquitas
fuit, vt affirmaret etiam incredibilia dictu. Xanthus historiarum auctor, in
prima earum tradidit, occisum draconis catulum reuocatum ad vitam a parente
herba, quam Balin nominat: eademque Tillonem, quem draco occiderat, restitutum
saluti. Et luba in Arabia herba reuocatum ad vitam hominem tradit. Dixit
Democritus, credidit Theophrastus esse herbam, cuius contactu illatae ab alite,
quam retulimus, exiliret cuneus a pastoribus arbori adactus. Quae etiam si fide
carent, admirationem tamen implent: coguntque confiteri, multum esse quod vero
supersit. Inde and plaerosque video existimare, nihil non herbarum vi effici
posse, sed plurimarum vires esse incognitas. Quorum numero fuit Herophilus
clarus in medicina: a quo ferunt dictum, quasdam etiam fortassis calcatas
prodesse. Obseruatum certe est, inflammari vulnera ac morbos superuentu eorum,
qui pedibus iter confecerint. Haec erat inter antiqua medicina, quae tota
migrabat in Graeciae linguas. Sed quare nunc non plures nascuntur caussae? Nisi
quod eas agrestes, litterarumque ignari experiuntur, vtpote qui soli inter
illas viuant. Praeterea securitas quaerendi, obuia medicorum turba. Multis
etiam iuuentis nomina desunt, sicut illi quam retulimus in frugum cura,
scimusque defossam in angulis segetis praestare, ne qua auis intret. Turpissima
caussa raritatis, quod etiam quisciunt, demonstrare nolunt tanquam ipsis
periturum sit quod tradiderint alijs. Accedit ratio inuentionis anceps. Quippe
etiam in repertis, alias inuenit casus, alias (vt vere dixerim) Deus.
Insanabilis ad hosce annos fuit rabidi canis morsus, pauorem aquae, potusque
omnis afferens odium. Nuper cuiusdam militantis in prtorio matter vidit in
quiet, vt radicem syluestris rosae, quam cynorhodon vocant, eblanditam sibi
aspectu pridie in fruteto, mitteret filio bibendam in lacte (in Lusitania res
gerebatur, Hispaniae proxima part) casuque accidit, vt milite a morsu canis
incipiente aquas expauescere, superueniret epistola orantis vt pareret
religioni: seruatusque est ex insperato: and postea quisquis auxilium simile
tentauit, Alias apud auctores cynorhodi vna medicina erat, spongiolae, quae in
medijs spinis eius nascitur, cinere cum melle alopecias capitis expleri. In
eadem prouincia cognoui in agro hospitis nuper ibi repertum dracunculum
appellatum, caulem pollicari crassitudine, versiculoribus viperarum maculis,
quem ferebant contra omnium morsus esse remedium. Alius est quem nos in priori
volumine eiusdem nominis diximus, sed huic alia figura, aliudque miraculum
exeuntis e terra ad primas serpentium vernationes bipedali fere altitudine,
rursusque cum ijsdem in terram se condentis: nec omnino occultato eo apparet
serpens, vel hoc per se satis officioso naturae munere, si tantum praemoneret,
tempusque formidinis demonstraret.

Alia herbarum laus, ex eodem Plinio libro vicesimoseptimo, cap. 1.
CRESCIT APVD me certe tractatu ipso admiratio antiquitatis: quantoque mayor
copia herbarum dicenda restat, tanto magis adorare priscoru^ in inueniendo
curam, in tradendo benignitatem subit. Nec dubie superata hoc modo posset
videri etiam rerum naturae ipsius munificentia, si humani operis esset
inuentio. Nunc vero deorum fuisse eam apparet, aut certe diuinam, etiam cum
homo inuenerit: eandemque omnium parentem genuisse haec and ostendisse, nullo
vitae miraculo maiore, si veru^ fateri volumus. Scynthicam herba^ a Maeotidis
paludibus, and euphorbiam e monte Atlante, vltraque Herculis columnas, and ipso
rerum naturae defectu, alia part Britannicam ex oceani insulis extra terras
positis: ite^que thiopidem ab exusto sideribus axe alias prterea aliunde vltro
citroque human saluti in toto orb terrarum portari, immensa Romanae pacis
maiestate, non homines modo diuersis inter se terris gentibusque, verum etiam
montes, and excedentia in nubibus iuga, pastusque pecorum and herbae quoque
inuicem ostentant. Aeternum quaeso deorum sit munus istud. Adeo Romanos, velut
alteram lucem, dedisse rebus humanis videntur.

De laud Agriculturae ex Marco Catone initio operis sui.
EST INTERDVM praestare populo, mercaturis rem quaerere, ni tam periculosum
siet, and item foenerari, si tam honestum siet: maiores enim nostri sic
habuerunt, and ita in legibus posuerunt, furem duplici condemnari,
foeneratorem, quadrupli. Quanto peiorem ciuem existimaru^t foeneratorem, quam
furem, hinc licet existimari. Et virum bonum cum laudabant ita laudabant, bonum
agricolam, bonumque colonum amplissime laudari existimabatur, qui ita
laudabatur. Mercatorem autem strennuum, studiosumque rei querendae existimo,
verum, vt supra dixi periculosum, and calamitosum. At ex agricolis, and viri
fortissimi, and milites strennuissimi gignuntur, maximeque pius qustus,
stabilissimusque consequitur, minimeque inuidiosos, minimeque male cogitantes
sunt, qui in eo studio occupati sunt.

Quod antiquis maximum studium Agriculturae fuerit, and de culturae hortorum
singularis diligentia, ex Plinio libro 18. cap. 1.
SEQVITVR natura frugum hortorumque ac florum, quaeque alia praeter arbores aut
frutices benigna tellure proueniunt, vel perse tantum herbarum immensa
contemplatione, si quis aestimet varietatem, numerum, flores odores,
coloresque, and succos ac vires earum, quas salutis aut voluptatis hominum
gratia gignit: qua in part primum omnium patrocinari terrae, and adesse
cunctorum parenti iuuat, quanquam inter initia operis defense. Quoniam tamen
ipsa materia intus accendit ad reputationem eiusdem parientis and noxia,
nostris eam criminibus vrgemus, culpamque nostram illi imputamus. Genuit
venena, sed quis inuenit illa praeter hominem? Cauere ac refugere alitibus
ferisque satis est. Atque cum in arbores exacuant limentque cornua elephanti,
and duro saxo rhinocerotes, and vtroque apri dentium sicas, sciantque ad
nocendum se praeparare animalia, quod tamen eorum tela sua excepto homine
venenis tingit? Nos and sagittas vngimus, and ferro ipsi nocentius aliquid
damus. Nos and flumina inficimus and rerum naturae elementa. Ipsum quoque quo
viuitur ae^rem in perniciem vertimus, Neque est vt putemus ignorari ea ab
animalibus, quae quidem quae praepararent contra serpentium dimicationem, quae
post praelium ad medendum excogitarent, indicauimus. Nec ab vllo praeter
hominem veneno pugnatur alieno. Fateamur ergo culpam, neijs quidem quae
nascuntur contenti: etenim quando plura earum genera humana manu fiunt. Quid?
non and homines quidem ad venena nascuntur? Atra hominu^ ceu serpentium lingua
vibrat, tabesque animi contrectata adurit culpantium omnia, ac dirarum alitum
modo, tenebris quoque and ipsarum noctium quieti inuidentium gemitu (quae sola
vox eorum est) vt in auspicatarum animantiu^ vice obuij quoque vetent agere,
aut prodesse vitae. Nec vllum aliud abominati spiritus prmium nouere, quam
odisse omnia. Verum and in hoc eadem naturae maiestas tanto plures bonos genuit
ac frugi, qua^to fertilior in ijs quae iuua^t aluntque: quoru^ stimatione and
gaudio nos quoque relictis aestuatione suae istis hominum turbis, pergamus
excolere vitam: eoque constantius, quo operae nobis mayor quam fam gratia
expetitur. Quippe sermo circa rura est, agrestesque vsus, sed quibus vita
honosque apud priscos maximus fuerit.

De ijs qui in agri and hortorum cura Romae illustres fuerunt, ex Plinij lib.
18. cap. 3.
QVAE NAM ergo tantae vbertatis caussa erat? Ipsorum tunc manibus Imperatorum
colebantur agri (vt fas est credere) gaudente terra vomere laureato, and
triumphali aratore, sieve illi eadem cura semina tractabant, qua bella, eademque
diligentia arua disponebant, qua castra, five honestis manibus omnia laetius
proueniunt, quoniam and curiosius fiunt. Serentem inuenerunt dati honores,
Serranum, vnde cognomen. Aranti quatuor sua iugera in Vaticano, qu prata
Quintia appellantur, Cincinnato viator attulit dictaturam, and quidem (vt
tradit Norbanus) nudo plenoque pulueris etiamnum ore. Cui viator, Vela corpus,
inquit, vt proferam senatus populique Romani mandata. Tales tum etiam viatores
erant, quibus idipsum nomen inditum est, subinde ex agris senatum ducesque
accersentibus. At nunc eadem illa vincti pedes, damnatae manus, inscripti
vultus exercent: non tamen surda tellure, quae parens appellatur, colique
dicitur and ipsa, honor hinc assumpto, vt nunc inuita ca, and indigne ferente
credatur id fieri. Sed nos miramur ergastulorum no^ eadem emolumenta esse quae
fuerunt Imperatorum. Igitur de cultura agri praecipere principale fuit and apud
exteros. Siquidem and reges fecere Hieron, Philometor, Attalus, Archelaus, and
duces Xenophon, and Poenus etiam Mago: cui quidem tantum honorem senatus noster
attribuit Carthagine capta, vt cum regulis Afric bibliothecas donaret, vnius
eius duo detriginta, volumina censeret in Latinam linguam transferenda, cum M.
Cato praecepta condidisset, peritisque lingu Punicae dandum negocium: in quo
praecessit omnis vir tum clarissimae familiae D. Syllanus, sapientiae
compositissimae. Quos sequeremur prtexuimus in hoc volumine non ingrate
nominando M. Varronem, qui octogesimum primum vitae annum agens, de ea re
prodendum putauit.

Laus Agric^larum, and quae obseruanda in agro parando, ex Plinij lib. 18. cap.
5.
FORTISSIMI viri and milites strennuissimi ex agricolis gignuntur, minimeque
male cogitantes. Praedium ne cupide emas. In re rustica operi ne parcas, in
agro emendo minime. Quod male emptum est, semper poenitet. Agrum paraturos,
ante omnia intueri oportet, aquarum vim, and vicinum. Singula magnas
interpretationes habent, nec dubias. Cato in conterminis hoc amplius aestimari
iubet, quo pacto niteant. In bona est, inquit, regione been nitere. Attilius
Regulus ille Punico bello bis consul, aiebat, neque foecundissimis locis
insalubrem agrum paradum, neque effoetis faluberrimum. Salubritas loci non
semper incolarum color detegitur, quoniam assueti in pestilentibus durant.
Praeterea sunt quaedam partibus anni salubria: nihil autem salutare est, nisi
quod toto anno salubre. Malus est ager, cum quo dominus luctatur. Cato inter
prima spectari iubet, nu^ solum sua virtute valeat qua dictum est positione. Vt
operariorum copia prope fit, oppidumque validum: Vt nauigiorum euectus vel
itinerum: vt been aedificatus and cultus. In quo falli plerosque video.
Segniciem enim prioris domini pro emptore esse arbitra^tur. Nihil est damnosius
deserto agro. Itaque Cato, de bono domino melius emi, nec temere contemnendam
alienam disciplinam: agroque vt homini, quamuis qustuosus sit, si tamen and
sumptuosus, non multum superesse. Ille in agro quaestuofissimam iudicat vitem:
non frustra, quoniam ante omnia de impens ratione cauit. Proxime hortos
irriguos: nec id falso, si and sub oppido sint. Et prata, quae antiqui prata
dixere. Idemque Cato interrogatus, quis esset certissimus quaestus? respondit:
Si been pascat, quis proximus* si mediocriter pascat. Summa omnium in hoc
spectando fuit, vt fructus is maxim probaretur, qui quam minimo impendio
constaturus esset. Hoc ex locorum occasion aliter alibi decernitur. Eodemque
pertinet, quod agricolam vendace^ oportere esse dixit. Fundum in adolescentia
consere^dum sine cunctatione, aedificandu^ non nisi consito agro. Tunc quoque
cuncta^ter, optimumque est (vt vulgo dixere) aliena insania frui, sed ita, vt
villaru^ tutela non sit oneri. Eum tame^ qui been habitet, spius ventitare in
agrum: frontemque domini plus prodesse quam occipitium, non mentiuntur.

De hortorum cura ex Plinio lib. 19. cap. 4.
AB HIS superest reuerti ad hortorum curam, and suapte natura memorandam. Et
quoniam antiquitas nihil prius mirata est, quam and Hesperidum hortos, ac regum
Adonis and Alcinoi, itemque Pensiles, sieve illos Semiramis, sieve Assyriae rex
Cyrus fecerit, de quorum opere alio volumine dicemus. Romani quidem reges ipsi
coluere. Quippe etiam superbus Tarquinius nu^cium illum suum atque sanguinarium
remisit ex horto. In duodecim tabulis legum nostrarum nusquam nominatur villa,
semper in significatione ea hortus: in horti vero haeredium. Quam rem comitata
est and religio quaedam: hortosque and fores tantum contra inuidentium
fascinationes dicari videmus. In remedio saturnica signa, quanquam hortos
tutelae Veneris assigna^te Plauto. Iam quidam hortorum nomine in ipsa vrbe
delitias, agros, villasque possident. Primus hoc instituit. Athenis Epicurus,
hortorum magister. Vsque ad eum, moris non fuerat in oppidis haberi rura. Rom
quidem perse hortus ager pauperis erat. Ex horto plebi macellum, quanto
innocentiore victu. Mergi enim credo in profunda satius est, and ostrearum
genera naufragio exquiri: aues vltra Phaside^ amnem, peti and fabuloso quide^
terrore tutas, imo sic preciosiores, Alias in Numidia atque Aethiopia in
sepulchris aucupari, aut pugnare cum feris, mandi ab eo cupientem quod ma^dat
alius. Ad hercle, quam vilia haec, quam parata voluptati satietatique, nisi
eadem quae vbique indignatio occurreret. Ferendum sane fuerit exquisita nasci
poma, alia sapore, alia magnitudine, alia mo^stro, pauperibus interdicta,
inueterari vina saccisque castrari: nec cuiquam adeo longam esse vitam, vt non
ante se genita poter. E frugibus quoque quodda^ alimentum excogitasse luxuriam,
ac medullam tantum earum superque pristinarum operibus and claturis viuere,
alios pane procerum, alios vulgi, tot generibus vsque ad infimam plebem
descendente annona. Etiamne in herbis discrimen inuentum est? Opesque
differentiam fecere in cibo, etiam vno ass venali. Et in his aliqua quoque
sibi nasci tribus negant, caul in tantum saginato, vt pauperis mensa non
capiat. Syluestres fecerat natura corrudas, vt quisque demeteret passim. Ecce
altiles spectantur asparagi. Et Rauenna ternis libris rependit. Heu prodigia
ventris, Mirum esset non licere carduis pecori vesci, non licet plebi, Aquae
quoque separantur. Et ipsa naturae elementa vi pecuniae discreta sunt. Hi
niues, illi glaciem potant poenasque montium in voluptatem gul vertunt.
Seruatur algor estibus, excogitaturque, vt alienis mensibus nix algeat.
Decoquunt alias quas mox and illas hyemant. Nihil itaque homini sic quomodo
rerum naturae placet. Etiamne herba aliqua diuitijs tantum nascitur? Nemo
sacros, Auentinosque montes, and iratae plebis secessus circu^spexerit? Mors
enim certe quabit quos pecunia superauerit. Itaque hercle, nullum macelli
vectigal maius fuit ROMAN clamore plebis incusantis apud omnes Principes, donec
remissum est portorium mercis huius co^pertumque, non aliter quaestuosius
censum haberi aut tutius, ac minore fortunae iure cum credatur pensio ea
pauperum. Is in solo sponsor est, and sub die redditus, superficiesque coelo
quocunque gau. dens. Hortorum CATO prdicat caules. Hinc primum agricol
existimabantur prisci, and sic statim faciebant iudicium, nequam esse in domo
matremfamilias (etenim haec cura foeminae dicebatur) vbi indilige^s esset
hortus. Quippe carnario aut macello viuendum est, nec caulus vt nunc maxim
probabant, damnantes, pulmentaria quae egerent alio pulmentario. Id erat oleo
parcere. Nam carnis desyderia etia^ erant exprobratione. Horti maxim
placebant, quia non egerent igni, parcerentque ligno. Expedita res and parata
semper, vnde and acetaria appellabantur, facilia concoqui, nec oneratura sensum
cibo, and qu minime accederent ad desyderium panis. Pars eoru^ ad condimenta
pertinens, fatetur domi versutam fieri solitam, atque non Indicum piper
quaesitum, quque trans maria petimus. Iam quoque in fenestris suis plebis
vrbana in imagine hortorum quotidiana oculis rura praebebant, antequam praefigi
prospectus omnibus coegit multitudinis innumeratae sua latrocinatio. Quam obrem
sit aliquis and his honos, neue auctoritatem rebus vilitas adimat, cum prsertim
etiam cognomina procerum inde nata videamus, Lactucinosque in Valeria familia
non puduisse appellari: and contingat aliqua gratia, operi curaeque nostr,
Virgilio quoque confesso, quam sit difficile verborum honorem tam paruis
perhibere. Hortos villae iungendos non est dubium, riguosque maxim habendos,
si contingat profluo amne. Si minus, e puteo pertica, organisue pneumaticis,
vel tollenonum haustu rigandos. Solum proscindendum a fauonio, in autumnum
praeparandum est post quatuordecim dies, iterandumque ante brumam. Octo iugerum
operis palari iustum est. Fimum tres pedes alte cum terra misceri, areis
distingui, easque resupinis puluinorum toris ambiri singulis tramitum sulcis,
qua detur accessus homini, scatebrisque decursus.

In his hortis nascentium alia bulbo commendentur, alia capite, alia caul,

Ratio rigandorum hortorum, and quae translate meliora fiant. Item de succis
hortensiorum and saporibus, ex Plinio lib. 19. cap. 12.
HIS HORAE rigandi matutina atque vespera, ne inferuescat aqua sole. Ocimo
tantum and meridiana etiam. Satum celerrime erumpere putant inter initia
feruenti aqua aspersum. Omnia autem translata meliora gra^dioraque fiunt,
maxim porri, napique. In translatione and medicina est, desinuntque sentire
iniurias, vt gethyum, porrum, raphani, apium, lactucae, rapa, cucumis. Omnia
autem syluestria fere sunt and folijs minora and caulibus, succo acriora, sicut
cunila, origanu^, ruta. Solummodo ex omnibus lapathum syluestre melius. Hoc in
satiuum rumex vocatur, nasciturque fortissimum. Traditur semel satum durare,
nec vnquam vitiari, terra maxim iuxta aquam. Vsus eius cum ptisana tantum in
cibis leuiorem gratioremque saporem prstat. Syluestre ad multa medicamenta
vtile est. Adeoque nihil omisit cura, vt carmine quoque comprehensum repererim,
in fabis caprini fimi singulis cauatis, si porri, eruc, lactucae, apij, intubi,
nasturtij semina inclusa serantur, mire prouenire. Quae sunt syluestria, eadem
in satiuis sicciora intelliguntur and acutiora. Namque and succorum saporumque
dicenda differentia est, vel mayor in his quam pomis. Sunt autem acres cunilae,
origani, nasturtij, sinapis. Amari, absynthij, centaureae. Aquatiles,
cucumeris, cucurbitae, lactucae. Acuti tantum cunilae. Acuti and odorati, apij,
anethi, foeniculi. Salsus tantum e saporibus non nascitur, alioquin extra
insidit pulueris modo, and circulis tantum a quae vt intelligatur vana, ceu
plaerumque vit persuasio. Panax Piperis saporem reddit, magis etiam
siliquastrum, ob id piperitidis nomine accepto. Libanotis odore^ thuris, murrha
myrrh. De panace abunde dictum est. Libanotis locis putridis and macris ac
roscidis seritur semine. Radicem habet olusatri, nihil a thure differentem.
Vsus eius post annum stomacho faluberrimus. Quidam eam nomine alio rosmarinum
appellant. Et smyrnium olus seritur ijsdem locis, myrrhamque radice resipit.
Eadem and siliquastro satio. Reliqua a cteris odore and sapore differunt, vt
anethum. Tantaque est diuersitas atque vis, vt non solum aliud alio mutetur,
sed etiam in totum auferatur. Apio eximi in coctis obsonijs aceto, in eodem
cellario in saccis odorem vino grauem. Et hactenus hortensia dicta sint,
ciborum gratia duntaxat. Maximum quidem opus in ijsdem naturae restat, quoniam
prouentus tantum adhuc, summasque quasdam tractauimus. Vera autem cuiusque
natura non nisi medico effectu praenosci potest, opus ingens occultumque
diuinitatis, and quo nullum reperiri possit maius. Ne singulis id rebus
contexeremus iusta fecit ratio, cum ad alios medendi desyderia pertinerent,
longius vtriusque dilationibus futuris si miscuissemus. Nunc suis quae que
partibus constabunt, poteruntque a volentibus iungi.

De morbis hortorum, and remedijs circa formicas, and culices, ex Plinio lib.
19. ca. 10.
MORBOS HORTENTIA quoque sentiunt, sicut reliqua terrae sata. Namque and Ocimum
se necat, degeneratque rite in Serpillum, and sisymbrium in calamintam. Et ex
semine brassic veteris, rap fiunt. Atque inuicem enecatur cyminum ab imo dorso,

ortu pallescit. Omnia vero accessu mulieris menstrualis flauescunt. Bestiolarum
quoque genera innascuntur, Napis culices, raphano eruc, and vermiculi. Item
lactucis and oleri. Vtrisque hoc amplius limaces and cochleae. Porro vero
priuatim animalia quae facillime stercore iniecto capiuntur condentia in id se.

obnoxia esse. Infestant and culices hortos, riguos praecipue, si sunt
arbusculae aliquae. Hi galbano acce^so fugantur.

De muestigandis qualitatibus Herbarum ex color, odore, and succis ex Plinij
lib. 21. cap. 7.
TRoianis temporibus ei iam erat honos. Et hos certe flores Homerus treis
laudat, loton, croco^, hyacinthum. Omnium autem odoramentorum, atque adeo
herbarum differentia est in color, and odore, and succo. Odorato sapor raro
vlli non amarus, econtrario dulcia raro odorata: itaque and vina odoratiora
mustis, syluestria magis omnia satiuis. Quorundam odor suauiore longinquo est,
propius admotus hebetatur, vt violae. Rosa recens a longinquo olet, sicca
propius. Omnis autem verno tempore acrior, and matutinis. Quicquid ad
meridianas horas diei vergit, hebetatur. Nouella quoque vetustis minus odorata.
Acerrimus tamen odor omnium aestate media. Rosa and crocum odoratiora, cum
serenis diebus leguntur: and omnia in calidis magis quam in frigidis. In
Aegypto tamen minime odorati flores, quianebulosus and roscidus ae^r est a Nilo
flumine. Quorundam suauitati grauitas inest. Ruceros, foenum gracum.
Quaeda^ cum virent non olent, propter humorem nimium: vt buceros, quod est
foenum graecum. Acutus odor non omnium sine succo est, vt violae, rosae, croco.
Quae vero ex acutis succo carent, eorum omnium odor grauis, vt in lilio
vtriusque generis. Abrotonum and amaracus acres habent odores. Quorundam flos
tantum iucundus, reliquae parts ignauae, vt violae ac rosae, Horte^sium
odoratissima quae sicca, vt ruta, menta, apium and quae in siccis nascuntur.
Qudam vetustate odoratiora, vt cotonea cademque decerpta, quam in suis
radicibus. Qudam non nisi defracta, aut ex attritu olent. Alia non nisi
detracto cortice. Qudam vero non nisi vsta, sicut thura, myrrhque. Flore^ triti
omnes amariores quam intacti. Aliqua arida diutius odorem continent; vt
melilotos. Quedam locum ipsum odoratiorem faciunt, vt iris, quin and arborem to
tam cuiuscumque radices attingunt. Hesperis noctu magis olet, inde nomine
inuento. Animalium nullum odoratum, nisi de partheris quicquam dictum est, si
credimus.

Quibus temporibus maxim legendae sunt herbae, ex Dioscoridis praefatione.
VERVMIN PRIMIS curam impendere oportet, vt suis temporibus singula and
demetantur, and recondantur. Intempestiue enim decerpta, conditaue, aut nullo,
aut euanido munere funguntur. Serena etenim coeli constitutione demetenda sunt.
Magni siquidem refert inter colligendum, si vel squallores, vel imbres infesti
sint: quemadmodum si loca in quibus prodeunt cliuosa, and ventis exposita sint,
and perflata, frigidaque and aquis carentia: in his enim locis vires eorum
long validiores intelliguntur. Contra, quae in campestribus, riguis and
opacis, ceterisque locis a vento silentibus enascuntur, plaerunque degenerant,
and minus viribus valent: multoque magis, si non suis horis peropportune
colligantur, aut si per imbecillitatem intabuerint. Neque ignorandum, quod spe
prcoci, aut serotina loci natura, aut anni clementia, maturius, aut celerius
adolescu^t. Nonnulla propria vi hyeme florent and folia pariunt, qudam bis anno
florifera. Quare cui in animo est, horum peritia^ assequi, necesse est ijs
prima germinatione solo emergentibus, adultis, and senescentibus adesse. Nam
qui pullulanti herb duntaxat astiterit, adultam cognoscere non potest: neque

names in sundry languages / and also their temperature / Complexions / and
virtuous operations. Compiled by the learned D. Remberte Dodoens, now Physician
to the Emperor his Majesty.
Of Sothrenwood. Chap. i.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Sothrenwood (as Dioscorides says) the one called
female Sothrenwood, or the great Sothrenwood, the other is the male kind, or
small Sothrenwood, and are both meetely common in this Contrie.

Abrotonum foemina. Great Sothrenwood.


Abrotonum mas. Small Sothrenwood.


The Description.






The Place.
The two first kinds grow not in this country, but only in gardens whereas
they are planted: neither the third kind, which is more seldom found, and
less known then the other.

The Time.
They flower in August, and their seed may be gathered in September.

The Names.
Southrenwood is called in Greek (...): in Latin and in Shoppes Abrotonum: in
Italion and Spanish Abrotano, yet some of them call it Hyerua Lombriguera: in
high Douch Stabwurtz, Gertwurtz, Garthagen, Shoswurtz, Kuttelkraut, Affrusch:
in base Almaigne Aueroone: in French Auronne.

Abrotonum foemina, that is to say, female Southrenwood: in french Auronne
femelle: in high douch Stabwurtz weiblin: in base Almaigne Aueroone wijfke^.

Abrotonum mas: in French Aronne masle: in high Douch Stabwurtz menelin: in
base Almaigne Aueroone manneken, and clein Aueroone.

Dioscorides calls in Greek (...): in Latin Abrotonum Siculum, which is a
kind of female Southrenwood: the high Almaignes do call it Wolrieckende
Stabwurtz, that is to say, sweet smelling, or sauering Southrenwood.

The Nature.
All the Sothrenwoods, are hoate and dry in ye third degree, and of subtle
parts.

The Virtues.






Palma Christi, rapes, or old oil Olive, restores the hear fallen from the
head, if the head be rubbed therewithal, twice a day in the Sun, or against
a fire.









Pliny writes yt if it be laid under the bed, pillow or bolster, it
provoke carnal copulation, and resists all enchantments, which may let or
hinder such business, and the inticements to the same.

The Danger.
Sothrenwood is a very hurtful enemy to the stomach: wherefore Galen the
chiefest of Physicians, never gave the same to be received into the body.

Of Wormwood. Chap. ij.
The Kinds.
THere be three sorts of Wormwood (as Dioscorides says). The first is our
common Wormwood. The second is sea Wormwood: the third kind is that, which is
called Santonicum. And bysides these, there is found an other kind, which is
called in this country Roman wormwood.

Absynthium Latifolium. Common Wormwood.


Seriphium. Sea Wormwood.


The Description.


There is also found in the gardens of some Herboristes of this country, an
other forte of this kind of Wormwood, the which is named of some men
Absynthiu^ Ponticum, much like to our common wormwood, saving the leaves are
much more iagged and finelier cut, and not so bitter (at the least way) as that
which is set and sown in this country.



Santonicum is almost like to Sea Wormwood, in his small tender and iagged
leaves, but the color of this is whiter, and the smell thereof is not so rank.







Absynthiu^ Po^ticum Galeni. Wormwood gentle / or Romayne.


The Place.
rude and vntoyled places. There is plenty of it, in many places of this
country.



Conrade Gesner, that famous Clerk writes.





The Time.
All the sorts of Wormwood, are in flower in July or August, or somewhat late:
And shortly after, the seed is ready to be gathered.

The Names.
Wormwood is called in Greek (...), and (...), or (...), because of his
bitterness: in Latin Absynthiu^, which name it has retained in shops even
until this present time. Apuleius calls it Absynthium rusticum: in Italian
Assenzo: in Spanishe Axensios, y Assensios, y Alosna. The high Douchmen do call
it Wermut, and Werommout, or Acker Werommout, that is to say, Field wormwood:
the base Almaignes do call it Alsene: in French it is called Aluyne.

Absynthium Latifolium, that is to say, great or broad leaued Wormwood.

That Wormwood that is most like unto the aforesaid, is called of the
Herboristes, Absynthium Ponticum, and Absynthium Graeci, and is a kind of the
first sort of Wormwood: and so is the Wormwood of Cappadocia, and the Wormwood
of mount Taurus, and likewise that Wormwood that grows along by the old
walls at Room. Whereof the good religious fathers, that wrote the Commentary
upon Antidotarium Mesue, have written. For all these sorts of Wormwood are of
the first kind, and may well be called Absynthia Latifolia, as a difference
from the other Wormwoods, whose leaves be a great deal finer and smaller: for
there is no great diversity betwixt these Wormwoods, saving in respect of the
places where as they grow.

Seriphium, and Absynthium Marinum: unknown of the Apothecaries. In English
Sea wormwood.

Herba alba: and without question, is the true Absynthium Santonicum. Miratur
fortasse, haec legens, Santonicum a Santonibus vt Dioscorides scribit
cognominatu^, apud Heluetios requiri, at hunc magis admirari aequum est,
Santonum prouinciam a quoquam in ea Galliae part, quae alpibus vicina est,
reponi. Santones enim Aquitani populi sunt, ad oram maritimam Oceani, infra
Garumnam fluuium versus Septentriones siti, longissime ab Alpibus, procul etiam
a Pyrenis. Quam ob causam mendosum hunc Dioscoridis locum esse oportet: aut
Dioscoridem, vel eum ex quo hc transcripsit, Geographiae fuisse rudem and
imperitum.

Galen, in the.xi. book of his Method in Greek (...): in Latin Absynthiu^
Ponticum: of the Apothecaries of Brabant Absynthium Romanum: in French, Aluyne
Roman or Pontique: in base Almaigne, Roomsche Alsene, because this is a
strange herb and not common in that country. For they do commonly call al
such strange herbs as be unknown of the common people, Romish or Romayne
herbs, although the same be brought from Norweigh, which is a country far
distant from Room.

Absynthium fatuum, and Absynthium infipidum.

Absynthiu^ angustifolium, and it is thought of some to be a kind of Lauender,
because his leaves has small leaves like Lauender: it may be called in English
Lauender-wormewood, or narrow leaued wormwood.

The Nature or Temperament.


Santoni wormwood, or French wormwood.



The Virtues.
Galen says.























worms engendered within the body.

Dioscorides writes, that such Beeues, Sheep and Cattle, as feed upon Sea
Wormwood do wax very fat.

Galen writes.

Of Buglosse / or common langue de Beuse. Chap. iij.
The Kinds.
THe common Buglosse, or langue de beuf (as it is now called) is of diverse
kinds, whereof the first is the greatest, and it is familiar and common in
gardens: The three others are small: The fifth is the wild Buglosse, or
Sheep tongue.

Lycopsis. Garden Buglosse.


Anthusae genus. Alkanet.


The Description.
root is long and single and blackish in the outside.

Cyanus, the third is yellow, and in proportion long and hollow. The seed also
is like the other saving it is smaller and blacker. The roots of the Buglosses
and especially of the first kind of the lesser Buglosses, are of a diepe
read color, and are used to die, and color things withal.



The Place.






The Time.
They flower in June, July, and August, and forthwith they deliver their seed.

The Names.
The three herbs are called (in shoppes) all by one name, that is to say,
Buglossa or Lingua bouis: in French, Buglosse or Langue de buef: in high Douch,
Ochsenzung: in base Almaigne, Buglosse and Ossentonghe: in English, Buglosse
and Oxetongue: Albeit it is not the true Buglosse, for that is our common
Borage, whereof we shall write in his proper place. Whereunto agrees
Leonicenus, Manardus, and diverse other learned men of our time.

Lycopsis Syluestris. Wild Buglosse.


Lycopsis: in ye shoppes of this country Buglossa, and Buglossa domestica
mayor, that is to say, the great garden Buglosse, and of some it is called
Buglossus Longifolia. Peradventure it is that kind of Anchusae, which Paulus
Aeginetus calls in Greek (...), Choerospelethon.

Anchusae. The first is called in Greek (...), Anchusa onoclea: in French
Orchanetie: in English Alkanet, or Orchanet. The other is called in Greek
(...): in Latin Anchusa Alcibiadium, and Onocheles. This should be the second
kind of Anchusa or Orchanette: in English Alkanet.

Lycopus Syluestris, the Apothecaries call it Buglossa Syluestris. The French
men call it Buglosse or Langue de buef Sauu age. The base Almaignes, Wild
Ossentonghe, and some call it Scaepstonghe, that is to say, Sheep tongue, and
it may be Pseudanchusa Plinij.

The Nature.




The Virtues.








Of Echium or Tipers Buglosse. Chap. iiij.
The Description.
EChium has long rough and hearie leaves, much like to the leaves of Buglosse,
but smaller than the leaves of the first Buglosse. The stalk is rough, full of
littell branches, charged on every side with diverse small narrow leaves,
sharp pointed, and of a brown green color, scattered or spredde like littell
feathers, and very small toward the height or top of the stalk: betwixt
which leaves are the flowers of a sad blew or purple color at the first,
but when they do open, they show a fair Azure color, long and hollow, with
four or five littell small blewe threedes: nothing answering the flowers of
the other Buglosses, but only in the color. After that the flower is fallen,
the seed is black and small, like to the head of an Adder or Viper. The root
is long and straight, and red without.



The Place.


Montepelier.

The Time.
It floureth almost all the Somer long, and oftentimes or at sundry seasons it
brings forth seed as the other Buglosses.

The Names.
It is called in Greek (...): in Latin Echium Alcibiacum. Apuleius calls it
(...) in Greek: Viperina and Serpentaria in Latin: in Spanishe Yerua della
biuora: in French l'Herbe aux Vipers, and l'Herbe aux Serpens: in base Almaigne
Slanghencruye: it is called in English wild Buglosse the lesser: it may be
also called Vipers herb, or Vipers Buglosse.

Theoccasion of the name Alcibiacum.
This herb was called Alcibiacum, and Alcibiadion of one Alcibiades the first
finder out of the virtues of this herb, apresent remedy against the bitings
of Serpe^ts. For As the ancient Nicander writes, Alcibiades (being asleep)
was hurtwith a Serpent: wherefore when he awoke and saw this herb, he took
of it unto his mouth and chewed it, swalowing down the juice thereof: after
that he laid the herb being so chewed upon the sore, and was healed. Others
name it Echion, Echidnion, Viperina, etc. Which is as much to say as Vipers
herb, which names have been given to this plant, because it is very good
against the bitings of Serpents and Vipers, and because also his seed is like
the head of an Adder or Viper.

Echion sieve Alcibiacum.


The Nature.
It is of the same nature that Buglosse is of: but that it is somewhat hoater
and more subtle.

The Virtues.






Of Dogs tunge. Chap. v.
The Description.
which do cleave fast unto garments, when they are ripe, like unto Aegrimonie
and other rough seeds. The root is long and thick, and black withoutside.

The Place.
It grows almost every where in waste and untilled places, but specially in
sandy countries, about paths and high ways.

The Time.
It floureth in June, and his seed is ripe in July.

The Names.
It is called in Greek (...): in Latin and in Shoppes Cynoglossum,
Cynoglossa, and Lingua canis: whereof also the Italians call it Lingua de Cane:
the Spaniardes call it Lengua de perro: in English Dogs tunge or Hounds
tongue: in Freuch Langue de chien: in high Douch Hundszung: in base Almaigne
Houdtstonghe. This is that second kind of Cynoglossa, whereof Pliny wrote in
the eight chapter of the.xxv. Book: it should seem also to be a kind of
Isatis syluestris, which a man shall find described in some examples of
Dioscorides, in the Chapter Isatis: And of Aetius in his.x. book and.viij.
Chapter Limonium.

Cynogloss os altera Plinij.


The Nature.
Hounds tougue, but specially his root, is cold and dry, yea colder than the
great garding Buglosse.

The Virtues.








Of Gorage. Chap. vi.
The Description.
parting it self at the top into diverse small branches bearing fair and
pleasant flowers in fashion like Stars, of color blew or Azure, and
sometimes white. The seed is black, and there is found two or three
together in every husk, like as in the common Buglosse, but it is smaller and
blacker then Buglosse seed.



The Place.
It grows in all gardens, and in sandy champion countries.

The Time.
It begins to flower in June, and continues flouring all the Somer.

The Names.
The ancient Fathers called it in Greek (...): in Latin Lingua bubula,
Libanium, or Lingua bouis, that is to say, Langue de beuf ou vache: in English
Ox tongue: Pliny calls it (...), because it makes men glad and merry:
the Apothecaries name it Borago: and accordingly it is called in Italion
Borragine, in Spanish Borraia, and Borraienes, in English Borage: in French
Bourroche, or Bourrache, in Highdouche Burretsch: in base Almaigne, Bernagie or
Bornagie.

Buglossum verum.


The Nature.
It is hoate and moist.

The Virtues.




Dioscorides writes that he has heard say, that if one pound Borage, that
has but only three branches, together with his root and seed, and
afterward a man give the same to drink, to him that has a Tertian ague,
cures the same. Also that of four branches prepared after the same manner is
good to be given to drink against the fever Quartayne.

Of Anthyllis. Chap. vij.
The Kinds.
ANthyllis (as says Dioscorides) is of two sorts. Whereof one may be called
great Anthyllis, and the other small Anthyllis.

Anthyllis prior. Great Anthyllis.


Anthyllis altera, Kali species. Small Anthyllis.


The Description.
Anthyllis in his stalk and leaves, is not much unlike unto Lentill, saving
that it is whiter, softer, and sinaller. The stalk is of a foot high, white
and soft, with leaves spread broad white and soft also, but smaller and
thicker then Lentill leaves: the flowers clustering together at the top of
the stalk, of a yellow or pale color. The seed is in small husks. The root
is small and of woody substance.

Chamaepythis. It has five or six small branches or more, creping or trayling
along the ground, thick set, with little small narrow leaves, betwixt which
and the stalks there rises small purple flowers, with seed according. The
root is small, and of the length of a fingar. The whole herb is full of sape,
and salt like Tragus, whereof we shall speak hereafter, and of this herb they
make Axsen, which is used for the making of glasses.

The Place.
It grows in salt sandy grounds, as in Zeland along the coast, where there
is store of it.

The Time.
It floureth in June, and the seed is ripe in July.

The Names.
Dioscorides in Greek (...). And we have named it Anthyllis prior, as a
difference from the second Anthyllis. Pliny calls it in Latin Anthyllon,
Anthyllion, and Anthycellon: unknown of the Apothecaries. Some Arboristes do
call it Glaudiola, the which word is derived from Glaux, and some judge it to
be Glaux, albeit it is not the right Glaux.

Anthyllis altera, as a difference from the first Anthyllis: some of our time
do call it Borda.

The Nature.
It is dry, and serves properly, to heal and close up wounds.

The Virtues.
Anthyllis: it shall prevail much against the hoate piss, the Strangury or
difficulty to make water, and against the pain of the Reins.





Anthyllis taken with Oximell (that is honied Vinegar) is good for them that
have the falling sickness.

Of the Clote Burre. Chap. viij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Clote Burres in this country: the one is the great
Burre, and the other ye lesser Burre, the which Dioscorides described aparte.
Nevertheless we have reduced both into one chapter, because of the likelihood
that is betwixt them both in name and fasshion.

Arcium sieve Personata. Great Clote Burre.


Xanthium. Louse Burre, or the lesser Clote.


The Description.




The Place.
The Clote Burres delight to grow by the way side, about the borders of
fields, in untilled places, and dry Diches.

Burre: in French Bardane la grande, and Lap grande: grand Glouteron or
Gleteron: in high Douch Grosz kletten: in base Almaigne Groote Clissen.

Xanthium: in Shoppes Lappa minor, and Lappa inuersa: in Italian Lappola minore
in Spanish Pagamacera menor, that is to say, the small Burre, and the Burre
turned in and out: in French Le petit Glouteron in high Douch Bettlertsz leusz,

or sharp Burre: in base Almaigne cleyn Clissen: in English Diche Burre, and
lowse Burre.

The Nature.
The Clote Burres have power to dry up, consume, or dissolve: but the lesser is
the hoater.

The Virtues.

MUgworte has broad leaves, all iagged and torn like the leaves of Mormwood,
but something smaller, and specially those which grow about yt stalk, they
are of a brown green color above, and white hoare or gray underneath. The
stalk is long and straight and full of branches. The flowers are small round
buttons, growing along the branches, like Mormwood, smelling when they begin
to ware ripe somewhat after Marioram. The root is of a woody substance and

This herb is called in shops Artemisia, and of some Matter herbarum: in
Spanish Artemya: in English Mugworte: in French Armoyse, Cherbe S. Ian: in high
Douch Beyfusz, Bucken, and S. Iohans gurtel: in base Almaigne Byuoet, and S.
Ians cruyt, the which is this kind of Mugwort, which is called in Greek
(...): in Latin Artemisia tenuifolia, the which is the fourth kind in
Dioscorides, and the third kind in Apuleius.

The cause of the Name.
Mugworte as Pliny says, had this name of Artemisia Queen of Halicarnassus
and wife of Mausolus King of Carry, who chose this herb and gave it her name,
for before that it was called (...). Parthenis, that is to say, Virginal: some
say that Artemisia was so called of the Goddess Diana who was also called
Artemis, and for because this herb is singular for women's disseases, who are
all under the government of Diana, as the Heathen do imagine and dream.

The Nature.
Mugworte is somewhat astringent, and not to hoate.

The Virtues.






Pliny says) no venomous beast, or any like thing shall hurt him, and if he
travel upon the way, he shall not be weary.

Of Tansie. Chap. x.

The Names.
The first is now called in shoppes Tanacetum, and Athanasia: in English
Tansie: in French Athanasie, in high Douch Reinfarn: in base Almaigne Reynuaer,
and Wormcruyt. Some learned men judge it for to be the third kind of
Artemisia, called in Greek (...): in Latin Artemisia vnicaulis, of Apuleius
Artemisia Tragantes, or Tagetes.

The second without doubt is also a kind of Tansie, the which some learned
(and especially the famous Matthiolus of Siena,) do think it to be right
Milfoyle, called in Greek (...). But if this herb should be the right
Achillea, the common Tansie should be also without doubt a kind of Achillea,
for they are very much like one an other, not only in smell and taste, but
also in virtues and operation, as we have written in our Annotations.

The Nature.
Tansie is hoate in the second degree, and dry in the third, as it does well
appear by his strong smell, and bitter taste.

The small Tansie is of the like operation, or faculty.

The Virtues.

sharp or sower, and therefore are of a drying nature.

The Virtues.






Of Butter Burre. Chap. xiij.
The Description.
BVtter Burre has great round leaves, at the first like the leaves of
Folefoote, the which do afterward wax so great, that with one leaf, one may

in high Douch Naterwurtz: in Brabant Hertstonghen. This should seem to be
Dracunculus Latinoru^, whereof Pliny wrote in the. 6. chap. of the. 24. Book.

Colubrina, and of Leonard Fouchs, Naterwurtz weiblin, that is to say, Female
Adderwurte or Snakeweede: in French Grande Bistorte: and Serpentair femelle: in

Almaigne Coninghinne cruyt, Hertsclaueren, and Boelkens cruyt manneken.

Pseudohepatorium foemina: in base Almaigne Boelkens cruyt wijfken: it is
thought to be that Agrimonie whereof Auicen writes Chap. ccxliiij. and
therefore some have called it Eupatorium Auicennae.

Matthiolus describes an other Scorpioides, with sle^der stalks, and round
leaves sometimes three together. At the top of the stalks grows two or
three little small long horns together, the which also do show as they were
separated by certain joints.

Bysides these two kinds of Scorpioides, there is yet two other small herbs
which some do also name Scorpion grass, or Scorpion worte, although they be
not the right Scorpion grass. The one of them is called Male Scorpion, the
other female Scorpion.

the gardens of certain Herboristes.

Scorpioides, grows in meadows, along by running streams and
watercoursses: and the nearer it grows to the water, the greater it is, and
the higher, so that the leaves do sometimes grow to the quantity of willow
leaves.

The Description.
ANdrosemon is like to Saint John's worte, and S. Peter's grass. It has many
round stalks coming out of one root, the which do bring forth leaves,
much larger than the leaves of S. John's wurte, in ye beginning green, but
after that the seed is ripe, they wax read, and than being bruised betwixt
ones fingers, they yield a red sap or juice. At the top of the stalks
grows small knoppes or round buttons, the which in their opening do bring
forth flowers like to S. John's grass, but greater: when they are fallen or
perisshed, there appears littell small pellots or round balls, very red at

or bearies is contained the seed, which is small and brown, the root is
hard and of wooddie substance, yearly sending forth new springs.

Androsaemon.


The Place.
This herb grows not in this country, except in gardens where as it is
sown and planted. The Authors of Stirp. Aduers. noua, do affirm that
Androsemon grows by Bristow in England in S. Vincentes Rocks and woody
Cleues beyond the water. But if Androsemon be Tursan or Park leaves, it
grows plentifully in woods and parkes, in the west parts of England.

Tutsan so called in French and in English, is thought of some late writers to
be Clymenon, and is called of the^ Clymenon Italorum, sieve Siciliana: of our
Apothecaries Agnus castus.

The Nature.
It is hoate and dry like S. John's grass, or S. Peter's wurte.

The Virtues.
Galen says. Tutsan is much used in Baulmes, Drenches, and other remedies for
wounds.

Douche, Weibt and Waydt: in base Almaigne, Weebt.

The Nature.




The Virtues.








Of Dyers weed. Chap. xlvij.
The Description.
THe leaves of this herb are long, narrow and blackish, not much unlike the
leaves of Woad, but they are smaller, narrower, and shorter, from the midst
whereof comes up the stalk to the length of three foot, covered bylow with
small narrow leaves, and above with little pale yellow flowers, thick set, and
clustering one above an other, the which do turn into small buttons, cut
cross wise, wherein the seed is contained, which is small and black. The
root is long and single.

The Place.
They sow it in sundry places of Brabant, as about Louayne, and Brussels: it
grows also of it self in places untilled, and by way sides.

The Time.
It floureth in May, and soon after the seed is ripe.

The Names.
This herb is called in Latin (as Ruellius writes) Herba lutea, and of some
Flos tinctorius: in base Almaigne Wounwe, and of some Orant, but not without
error: for Orant is an other herb nothing like unto this, as shall be more
plainly declared in the process of this book.

The Nature.
It is hoate and dry.

Herba lutea.


The Virtues.
Herba lutea is not received, for any use of Physic, and is unknown of the
Ancients, we be able to write nothing else of this herb, saving that it is
used of Dyers, to color and dye their clothes into green, and yellow.

Of S. James Worte. Chap. xlviij.
The Kinds.
Saint James worte, or as some call it, Saint James flower is of two sorts.

Iacobea. S. James worte.


Iacobea marina. S. James worte of the Sea.


The Description.




The Place.

buttons, in which is contained a blackishe seed, large, fat, and shining.

The Place.
Flax is sown in this country, in fat, and fine ground, especially in low
moist fields.

The Time.
It floureth in May and June.

The Names.
Flax is called in Greek (...): in Latin Linum, and in Shoppes it is
welknowen by the same name. And here ye may perceive the cause why the base
Almaignes do use the word Lyn, to all things made of Flax, or Line, as
Linendoeck and Lijnen laken, that is to say, Lyneclothe, or clothe made of
Line: in English Flax, or Line: in French Lin: in high Douche Flaschsz: in
base Almaigne Vlas.

Linum.


The Nature.
The seed, which is much used in medicine, is hoate in the first degree,
and temperate of moisture and dryness.

The Virtues.
The seed of Lyn boiled in water and laid too in manner of a pultis, or
plaster, appeaseth all pain.













The Danger.
The seed of Lin, taken into the body, is very evil for the stomach: it
hinders the digestion of meats, and engenders much windiness.

Of Hemp. Chap. l.
The Kinds.
THere are two kinds of Hemp, the one is fruitful and bears seed: The
other bears but flowers only.

The Description.




Cannabis semen faciens. Seed Hemp.


Ca^nabis absque semine. Barren Hemp.


The Place.


The seed of the male Hemp is ripe at the end of August, and in September.
The female Hemp is ripe in July.

Italian Cannape. in Spanish Ca^namo, Canauo: in English Hemp, Neckeweede, and
Gallowgrasse: in French Chanure, Chenneuis, or Cheneue: And here ye may
perceive the cause why the Normans and others do call the Cloche made of Hemp,
Chenneuis, or Canuas, for it sounds so after the Greek, Latin, and French:
the high Douchmen call Hemp Zamerhauff: in base Almaigne Kempe.

The Nature.
Hemp seed is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.








The Danger.
Hemp seed is hard of digestion, and contrary to the stomach, causing pain
and grief, and dullness in the head, and engenders gross and naughty humors
in all the body.

Of Lysimachion / Willow herb or Ious strife. Chap. LI.
The Kinds.
THere are now diverse kinds of Herbs comprehended under the name of
Lychimachia, but especially four, under which all the Lysimachies shall be
comprysed. The first is the right Lysimachion. The second is the red Willow
herb with coddes. The third is the second kind of read Willow herb without
Coddes. The fourth is a kind of blew Lysimachion.

The Description.
Lysimachus, or the yellow Lysimachus, has a round stalk, very littell
crested or straked, of a Cubite or two long. The leaves be long and narrow like
willow, or wythie leaves, nothing at all cut or snipt about the edges, but
three or four leaves standing one against an other round about the stalk, at
the joints. The flowers be yellow and without smell, and grow at the top of
the branches, in steed whereof when they are fallen away, there grows round
seed, like Coriander seed. The root is long and slender, creping here and
there, and puts forth diverse young springs, which at their first coming up
are read.

Lysimachus in leaves and stalks is like to the other, saving that his leaves
be not so broad, and are snipt about the edges, much like unto Willow leaves.
The flowers in color and making, are somewhat like the flowers of the common
wild Mallow or Hock, that is to say, it has four little broad round leaves
standing together, and lying one over an others edges, under which there
grows long husks or Coddes, like to the husks of stock Gillofers, which
husks do appear before the opening of the flower: the which husks or seed
vessels, do open of themselves, and cleave abroad into three or four parts,
or quarters, when the seed is ripe, the which because it is of a woolly or
cottony substance, is carried away with the wind. The root is but small and
threddy.

Lysimachion verum. Yellow Lysimachion or Louse stryffe.


Lysimachium purpureum primum. The first purple red, willow herb, or
Lysimachium, also the Son before the Father.


There is an other small kind of this sort, like to the other in stalk,
leaves, flowers and husks, saving that it is in all parts smaller, and the
stalk is so weak, that it can very seldom grow straight. The flowers be of
carnation color, like to Gillofloures, but somewhat smaller.

Yet there is a third kind of read Lysimachus, very like to the first read
kind. The flowers do grow also at the top or end of the husks, but they be
paler, and in making not so well like the other, but rather like to Gillofers
parted into four small leaves, which are set crossewise.

The second kind of read Lysimachus is like to the aforesaid, in stalks and
leaves:

Lysimachion purpureum alterum. Partizan Lysimachion, or Spiked Lysimachion.


Lysimachium caeruleum. Blew Lysimachion.




The Place.
The yellow and read do grow in waterish and moist places, in low meadows, and
about the brinckes and borders of water brooks and diches. The blew is not
found in this country but in the gardens of such as love Herbs.

The Time.
They do all flower most commonly in June, and July, and their seed is ripe in
August.

The Names.
Lysimachia is called in Greek (...): in Latin Lysimachium, Lysimachia, and
of some Salicaria, unknown in Shoppes: in English Lysimachia, Willow herb,
and Louse strife: in Spanish Lisimacho yerua.

Cornelle, Souscy d'eaue, Pellebosse, or Chassebosse: in high Almaigne
Geelwelderich: in base Almaigne Geelwederick.

Filius ante Patrem, that is to say, the son before the father, because yt
his long husks in which the seed is contained do come forth and wax great,
before that the flower opens: in English, the first red Lysimachus, or
wythie herb, or Louse strife: in French Lysimachie rouge: in high Douch Braun
or Rod weiderich: in base Almaigne Root wederick.

Lysimachus, or poynted willow Herb with the purple flower.

Lysimachium caeruleum in Latin: in English Blew or Azured Lysimachus.

The cause of the Name.
This herb took his name of the valiant and noble Lysimachus, the friend and
Cousin of Alexander the great, king of Macedonia, who first found out the
property of this herb, and taught it to his posterity or successors.

The Nature.
The yellow Lysimachus or golden Louse strife, is cold, dry, and astringent.

The temperament of the red and blew Lysimachia, is not yet known.

The Virtues.








The Choice.
When ye will use Lysimachus, for any grief aforesaid, ye shall take none
other but of that kind with the yellow flower, which is the right Lysimachus:
for although the others have now the self same name, yet have they not the
same virtue and operation.

Of Mercury. Chap. lij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Mercury: the garden, and wild Mercury: the which
again are divided into two other kinds, a Male, and Female, differing only

OF the herb called in Latin Pilosella, there is found at this time two
kinds: The one called the great Pilosella, the other small Pilosella, the
which some men do also call Mouse ear, howbeit they are not the right Mouse
ear.

Pilosella are spread upon the ground, white hoare, and hearie much like a
great Mouse ear. The stalk is also hearie, about a spanne long, and bears
double yellow flowers, the which do change into a certain hearie down or
Cotton seed, and is carried away with the wind. The root is of the length of
a fingar, and has many hearie strings.

Pilosella is like to the other, saving that it is much less. The leaves be
small and little, and white hoare next to the ground, and hearie also. The
flowers grow at the top of the stalks, many together, and are of color
sometimes yellow, sometimes read, and sometimes brown, and sometimes
speckled. The root is small and threddy.

Pilosella mayor. Great Pilosella.

The same Pilosella eaten or taken in meats; does cleanse and clarify the
sight and cures the redness of the eyes.

Of Golden flower Stechados / and Cotton weed. Chap. lxj.
The Kinds.
THere be two principal kinds of herbs, which bear white, soft, and
woolly, or Cottony leaves, which some men call Pilosellae, or Filagines. The
one having fair gold yellow and sweet smelling flowers. The other has pale
yellow flowers without smell, and is of three sorts, as it shall appear
hereafter.

The Description.


The other kind which is called Filago, or Cotton weed, is of three sorts, as
is before said.

Ageratum Aurelia. Golden Staechas or Moth weed.


Filago. Cotton weed.


Staechas, saving that they be longer, and broader, and somewhat of a greener
color. The flowers be round, and after the fasshion of buttons, growing at
the top of the stalks, a great many together, but nothing so yellow, as the
flowers of Golden Staechas, neither so long lasting, but are carried away with
the wind when they be ripe, like diverse other flowers.





The Place.
The first kind grows in sandy playnes, and dry Heathes, and is plentifully
found in sundry places by the river of Reene. In this country they sow it in
gardens. The other three kinds grows in this country in sandy grounds,
about dry Diches, and in certain moist places, and in wooddes.

The Time.
They flower most commonly, in June, and July. Cotton weed floureth often, and
again in August.

The Names.
Theophrastus in his nienth Book, and.xxj. Chapter, in Greek (...): in Latin
of Theodore Gaza Aurelia: And of Dioscorides (...) Ageratum: in Shoppes Sticas
citrina, and Sticados citrinum: Of some Tinearea, and Amaranthus Luteus: in
English Gold flower, Motheworte, or Golden Stechados, and of Turner Golden
Floureamor: in high Douch Rheinblumen, Mottenblumen, and Mottenkraut: in base
Almaigne Rheynbloemen and Rhijnbloemen.

There is yet an other herb descrybed by Dioscorides, called (...) Elichrysum
and Amaranthus, the which is nothing like to Sticas citrina. For (...)
Eliochryson of Theophrastus, and (...) Elychryson of Dioscorides, are two
several herbs. And therefore they are greatly deceived that think Sticas
citrina to be the Elichryson of Dioscorides.

Filago: in Spanish Yerua Golandrina: in high Douch Rhurkraut: in base Almaigne
Rhuercruyt, or Root melizoen cruyt, that is to say, Bloody Flixeworte.

The first of these three is called of Pliny, Herba impia, because that his
last flowers, do surmount and grow higher than the first.

Some would have these three herbs, to be that which the Gretians call (...):
and the Latinistes Centunculum, Centuncularis, and Tomentitia, but yet their
judgment is not right, as it shall appear in the Chapter next following.

The Nature.
These herbs be of a drying nature. The Gold flower or golden Staechas, is
hoate also, as it may be perceived by his bitterness.

The Virtues.
Staechas boiled in wine and dronken, kills worms, and brings them forth,
and is good against the bytings and stingins of venemouse beasts.

GNaphalion is a base or low herb, with many slender soft branches, and small
leaves, covered all over wc a certain white cotton or fine wool and very
thick: so that ye would say it were all wool or Cotton. The flowers be
yellow, and grow like buttons, at the top of the stalks, as ye may perceive
by the figure.

The Place.
This herb grows no where, but by the sea coast, there is plenty of it in
Languedock, and Province.

This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Gnaphalium, Ce^tunculus,
Centuncularis, Tucularis, Albinum, and of some Gelafo, Anaphalis, Anaxiton,
Hires, and Tomentitia. Also Bombax humilis: in English of Turner, Cudweed,
Chafeweed, Cartaphilago. It may be called also Pety Cotton, or small Bo^base:
in French Petit Coton, and l'herbe borreuse, or Cotoniere. Pena in his Stirp.
Aduers. noua, calls it Chamaezylon.

Gnaphalium.


The Nature.
Gnaphalion is dry and astringent.

The Virtues.
The leaves of Gnaphalion, boiled in thick red wine, are good against the
blouddy flixe, as Dioscorides, and Galen does witness.

Of Plantayne or Waybrede. Chap.lxiij.
The Kinds.
THere is found in this country, of three sorts of Plantayne great plenty,
bysides which there is yet an other found, which grows in salt ground,
all which in figure, do partly resemble one an other.

The Description.
little Torche. The root is short, white, and of the thickenesse of a fingar,
having many white hearie threedes. Of this kind, there is found an other, the
Spikes, ears, or torches whereof, are very dubble, so as in every Spyky ear,
in steed of the little knappes or heads, it brings forth a number of other
small torches, whereof each one is like to the spike or torch of great Plantayne.

Plantago mayor. Great Plantayne.


Plantago media. Middle Plantayne.








The Place.
The three first Plantaynes grow almost every where in this country, in
pastures and leases, about ways, and moist places.

Plantago minor. Small Plantayne. Ribworte.


Plantago marina. Sea Plantayne.


The Sea Plantayne grows in salt grounds, upon the banks and borders of
salt water streams, as in Zealand, and Barowgh in great plenty, by the water
Zoom.

The Time.
The Plantaynes do flower most commonly in this country, in the months of
June and July. The seed is ripe in August.

The Names.
Plantayne is called in Greek (...), that is Lingua Agnina, Lammes tungue:
(...): in Latin and in Shops Plantago: in Italian Plantagine: in Spanish
Tamchagen, Lengua de oueja: in English Plantayne: in high Douch Wegrich or
Schaffzungen: in base Almaigne Wechbree.

Plantago mayor, and Plantago rubra: in English Great Plantayne: in French
Grand Plantaine: in high Douch Roter Wegrich: in base Almaigne Roode wechbree.

Plantago media: in French Plantain moien: in English Middle Plantayne: in high
Douch Mittel and breyter Wegrich: in base Almaigne Breet wechbree.

Quinqueneruia: otherwise it is now called in Latin Lanceolata, and Lanceola:
in English Ribbeworte: in French Petit Plantain, Lanceole, and Lanceolette: in
high Douch Spitzer wegrich: in base Almaigne Cleyn wechbree, and Hontsribbe.

Plantago marina: in English Sea Plantayne: in French Plantain de mer: in base
Almaigne Zee Wechbree.

Plantayne is cold and dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.




















Of Buckhorne Plantayne / or Coronop Plantayne. Chap. lxiiij.
The Kinds.


The Description.
THe first Crowfoote or Hartshorne, has long narrow and hearie leaves, and
brings forth upon each side of the leaf three or four shore startes or
branches, almost like to the branches of a Hearts horn. It lies spread upon
the ground like a star. From the middle of those leaves, grows up small
round hearie stemmes, bearing long spiked knappes, or torches, like the middle
Plantayne. The root is long and threddy.

Pseudocoronopus. Buckhorne Plantayne.


Coronopus Ruellij.


Coronopispecies peregrina.




One may also place amongst ye kinds of Coronopus, a certain herb, which we
shall now offer unto you (the which is a stranger, and but little known in
this country) seeing that it is very well like to Harteshorne. The leaves be
long and narrow, branched with short startes, altogether like to the leaves of
Hearts horn, saving that sometimes they be bigger. They lie also flat, and
spread round upon the ground, and are somewhat rough, and hearie, like the
leaves of Hearts horn: so that it is hard to know one from an other, when
they are both without stalks and flowers. But when this herb begins to
have stalks and flowers, than the difference is easily marked: for this herb
brings forth two or three round stalks, parted into sundry branches, at the
top whereof are placed knoppes and buttons, like to Cyanus or Corn flower,
saving that the scales of the knappes or heads, be not so closely couched, and
laid one upon an other, and the said scales seem clear and thorough
shining, especially when the flower is fallen of and withered. The flowers come
forth of the said knops or heads, in color and making like the flowers of
Cychorie, but smaller. The root is long and slender.

The Place.






The Time.




The Names.
Cornu ceruinum, or Herba Stellae, and Stellaria: in English of Turner, and
Cooper Herb Iue, and Crowfoote Plantayne: of Pena, Buckhorne. We may also call
it Hearts horn Plantayne, Buckehorne Plantayne, or Coronop Plantayne: it is
called in French Corn de Cerf, or Dent au chien it is unknown in Shoppes: The
Brabanders, do call it Hertshoren, and Crayenuoet cruyt: Some late writers call
it in Greek (...): in Latin Pes cornicis: in high Douch Kraenfuz, supposing
it to be the same Coronopus, which Dioscorides has described in the. 123.
Chap. of his second book, although in deed they be not like at all: And
therefore we have called it (...), Pseudocoronopus, that is to say, Bastard
Crowfoote.

Coronopus made by Dioscorides, albeit that notwithstanding, the learned
Ruellius, Doctor in his time at Paris, could not be made believe, that this was
the right Coronopus. Wherefore for the same Ruellius sake, who made a lively
description of this herb, we do now call it Coronopus Ruellij: in base
Almaigne Crayenuoet, or Rauenuoet. They call it at Paris Verrucaria: in some
places of England they call it Swynescressis. We may also call it Ruellius
Coronopus.

Cyanus, in English blew Bottell. A man may doubt whether this be not
Dioscorides Coronopus, because that Hearts horn should seem to be a kind of
Plantayne. But because the Description of Coronopus is very short, we are not
able to assure you. This may also be a kind of Condrilla.

The Nature.


Ruellius Coronopus (as it is evident by the taste) is hoate and dry, like to
garden or town Cressis, but not all thing so hoate.

The Virtues.


Ruellius Coronop, be the true Coronopus, than the root thereof roasted in the
imbres or hoate Ashes, and eaten in meats is very good against the laske
proceeding from the coldness of the stomach, which is the cause of slimie
humors in the Guts: for which purpose the very sent, and taste of the root
here described, declares the same to be very good, because it is hoate and
somewhat astringent.

blooweth, in which is contained very small and brown seed.

The Place.
Mouse tail grows in good pastures, and certain meadows, and sometimes also
by high way sides.

The Time.

It is called in English Mouse tail, and Blood strange: in French Queue de
souris: and accordingly in Grecke (...): in Latin Cauda murina, and Cauda

Of Horse tail / or Shauegrasse. Chap. lxviij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Horse tail, or Shauegrasse; as Dioscorides and Pliny
writes.

The Description.
When the great Shauegrasse or Horse tail begins to spring, it brings
forth round naked, and hollow stemmes, rough and full of joints: yea their
roughness is such, that Turners, Cutelers, and other Artificers, do use them
to polish, and make plain, and smoth their works, as the heftes of knyues and
Daggers etc. At the top of those Asparagus, shutes or stemmes, grows small,
round, and black knoppes or tuffets. Afterward the stemmes do wax brown and
reddishe, and bring forth round about every knot or ioynte, diverse little,
small, slender, and knottie russhes. It mounteth so high, that with his hanging
russhes, or small branches, it is not much unlike to a Horse tail. The root
is white and has joints or knottes like the stalk or stem.

Of Fleaworte / or Fleabane. Chap. lxx.
The Description.
THe leaves of Fleebane, be long, narrow, and hearie, amongst which spring up
round and tender branches, set full of leaves like them aforesaid, but
smaller, and garnisshed at the top, with little, long, round, spikie knappes
like ears, with greenish flowers or blossoms, which do afterward change into a
brown and shyning seed, in proportion color and quantity like unto Fleas.

The Place.
This herb grows in fields, and deserte places, as Dioscorides says. In
this country men sow it in gardens, and where as it has been once sowe^, it
grows continually afterward of his own sowing, or sheding of seed.

The Time.
It floureth in July and August: and sometimes also the seed is ripe.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Psyllium, and Herba Pulicaris:

The Nature.
The seed of Psyllium or Fleaworte, (which is chiefly used in medicine) is
cold in the second degree, and temperate in moisture and dryness: As Galen
and Serapio writes.

The Virtues.












The Danger.
Too much of Fleabane seed taken inwardly, is very hurtful to man's nature: it
engenders coldness and stiffenesie through out the body, with pensive
heaviness of the heart, so that such as have dronken thereof, do sometimes
fall into great distress.

The Remedy.
When one has taken too much of the seed of Fleabane, so that he feels some
noyance or harm, above all things it shall be good for him, to provoke vomit,
with medicines convenient, to cast up if it be possible that which has been
before taken. Afterward give him to drink of the best and most sauoury old
wine that may be gotten, by it self, or boiled with Wormwood, or wine mengled
with honey and a little lie, or the Decoction of Dyll as Serapio writes: And
bysides this ye may give him all things that is good against the dangers that
happen of eating green Coliander.

Of certain Herbs / that fleet or swim upon the water. Chap. lxxj.
The Kinds.
THere be diverse sorts of herbs that grow in and above water, whereof the
greatest part shall be described, in other places, and other Chapters: so that
in this present Chapter, we shall entreat but only of four or five sorts
of them that grow upon the water.

The Description.
THe first and most notable of these kinds of floting herbs, the which is
called water spyke, or most commonly Po^deweede, has long round and knotty
branches. The leaves grow upon small short stems, and are large great and flat,
laid and carried upon the water, somewhat like to great Plantayne, but a great
deal smaller. The flowers grow at the top of the branches, above the water
upon long purple spykie knoppes like to the ears or spikes of Bistorte, the
which being perished, there comes up round knoppes, wherein the seed is
enclosed, which is hard.

Potamogeiton. Ponde weed.

the leaves, and are white, and a little yellow in the middell, parted into
three leaves, much like in figure to the flowers of water Plantayne, and the
flowers of water Milfoyle or Crabs clawe. The root is thick and short with
many long threedes or strings, like the root of water Milfoyle.



Polyanthemum palustre. White Crowfoote, or water Crowfoote.

The Time.
They do all flower in June and July.

Iacea nigra. Materfilon or Knapweede.


The Names.
These herbs were not described of the Ancient writers (as far as I can
learn) and therefore they have no Greek nor Latin name to us known.

Scabiosa: and of some (...): in English Scabious: in French Scabieuse: in

does cleanse the breast, and the lunges, and is good against an old Cough, and
the impostems of the breast, and all other inward parts, as in the clensing,
ripping, sodering, and healing of the same. The same effect has the Conserve
made with the flowers of Scabiouse and sugar to be used daily.

Scabious is also good against all itch and scuruinesse, to be pound and laid
to the same, or to be mixte with oils and ointments fit for the same.

the seed is carried away with the wind. The root is black and hard, short
and thick, with many threddy strings by the sides, the which in the middell,
or as it were about the heart of the same, seems as it were bitten of.

The Place.
Deuels bit grows in dry meadows and woods, and about way sides.

The Time.
This herb floureth most commonly in August, the which being in flower is
easy to be known, otherwise it is somewhat hard to be known, because it

half a foot or nine inches long: out of them grows small leaves, somewhat
long and thick, not much unlike the leaves of Prickmadam, saving they be
longer, and sharp poynted, with a hard prickley top or point, so that for

Of March Violets. Chap. i.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Violets: the garden and the wild Violet. The Garden
violets are of a fair dark or shining deep blewe color, and a very pleasant
and amiable smell. The wild Violets are without savor, and of a fainte blewe
or pale color.

The Description.


Viola Nigra. The black, or purple Violet.


Of this sort, there is an other kind planted in gardens, whose flowers are
very double, and full of leaves.

There is also a third kind, bearing flowers as white as snow.

And also a fourth kind (but not very common) whose flowers be of a dark
Crymsen, or old reddish purple color, in all other points like to the first,
as in his leaves, seed, and growing.



The Place.
The sweet garden Violet, grows under hedges, and about the borders of
fields and pastures, in good ground and fertyle soil, and it is also set and
planted in gardens. The wild kind which is without smell, grows in the
borders of dry, lean, and barren fields.

The garden violet floureth in March and April. The wild also does flower in
April, and afterward.

The Names.
The sweet Violet is called in Greek (...): in Latin Viola nigra, Viola
purpurea: and of Virgil Vaccinium: in Shoppes Viola: in English Violets, the
garden Violet, the sweet Violet, and the March violet: in Italian Viola
porporea, and Viola mammola: in Spanish Violetas: in French Violette de Mars,
ou de quaresme: in high Douch Blauw veiel, or Mertzen violen: in base Almaigne
Violetten: the Violet plant or herb is called in Shoppes Violaria, and Matter
violarum.

The cause of the Greek name.
The sweet Violet (as the Emperor Constantine writes) was called in Greek
Ion, after the name of that sweet guirle or pleasant damsel Io, which
Jupiter, after that he had got her with child, turned her into a trim
Heaffer or gallant Cow, because that his wife Juno (being both an angry and
Ielous Goddess) should not suspect that he loved Ion. In the honor of which
his Io, as also for her more delicate and wholesome feeding, the earth at the
commandment of Jupiter brought forth Violettes, the which after the name of
his well-beloved Io, he called in Greek Ion: and therefore they are also called
in Latin, as some do write, Violae, quasi vitulae and Vaccinia. Nicander
writes, that the name of Ion was given unto Violettes, because of the Nymphs
of Ionia, who first of all presented Jupiter with these kinds of flowers.

The Nature or Temperament.
Violets are cold in the first degree, and moist in the second.

The Virtues.


















Of Pances / or hearts ease. Chap. ij.
The Description.

dented, or toothed round about like a saw, betwixt the which leaves there
grow up from the stalk, small naked or bare ste^mes: bringing forth fair and
pleasant flowers, parted into five littell leaves, like to a Violet, each
flower being of three diverse colors, whereof the highest leaves for the most
part are of a violet, and purple color, the others are blewishe or yellow,
with black and yellow streekes along the same, and the middell hearie:
afterward there appear small Bollyns or knoppy husks, wherein the yellow
seed is enclosed.

The Place.
These flowers do grow in gardens, and there is many of them found growing
amongst the stubble in corn fields.

The Time.
They begin to flower incontinent after the Violets, and remain flouring all the summer long.

Viola tricolor.


The Names.
This flower is called in Greek (...): in Latin Viola slammea, Flamma* and at
this time Viola tricolor, Herba Trinitatis, Iacea, and Herba Clauellata: in
English Pances, Love in idleness, and Hearts ease: in French Pensee, and Pensee
menue: in high Douch Freyscham, Freyschamkraut, and Dreyfeltigkeytblumen: in
base Almaigne Dryevuldicheyt bloemen: and Penseen.

Of the Wall flower. Chap. iij.
The Description.
THe yellow Gillofer or Wall flower, is a littell shrubbe or bushe, that is
green both winter and somer, whose stalks are hard and of a woody substance,
and full of branches: the leaves growing thereon are somewhat thick set, long,
narrow, and green: at the top of the stalks or branches, grow the flowers,
which be very yellow, and fair, of a pleasant smell, every flower divided
into four small leaves, the which perisshed there comes up long Coddes or
husks, wherein is contained seed which is large, flat, and yellow.

The Place.
The yellow Gillofer or Wall flower, grows upon old walls, and stonehilled
houses, and is commonly planted in gardens.

The Time.
The yellow Gillofer does chiefly flower in March, April, and May.

The Names.
The yellow Gillofer is a kind of violets called in Greek (...), the which
are also called in Latin Leucoia lutea, and of Serapio and the Apothecaries
Keyri: and of Pliny (who has severed them from Leucoion, that is to say, from
the stock Gillofer, or rather the white violet) Violae luteae: in Italian
Viola giala: in Spanish Violetas amarillas. in English Yellow Gillofers, Wall
flowers, and Hearts ease: in French Violes iaunes, Giroflee iaulne: in high
Douch Geel veiel: in Brabant geel Vilieren, steen Vilieren.

Viola lutea.


The Nature.
Wall flowers are hoate and dry, and of subtle parts.

The Virtues.












Of Stock Gillofers / Garnesee Violets. Chap. iiij.
The Kinds.
THere are found two kinds of these Gillofloures. The one is great and called
the Castle, or stock Gillofer, the which may be kept both winter and somer.
The other is not so big, and is called the small stock Gillofer, the which
must be yearly sown again, and brings forth his flower and seed the same
year.

The Description.
THese two kinds of Violets or Gillofers, are not much unlike Walfloures
saving that their leaves be whiter and softer.





Leucoion.


The Place.
These kinds of Gillofers, are sown in the gardens of this country: of this
sort there is found an other kind in places near the sea coast, as in
Zealand not far from the shore, but the same is smaller and lower than that
which grows in gardens.

The Time.
The great Castle gillofer floureth in March and April, a year after the
sowing. The smaller floureth in July and August, the same year that it is
first sown.

The Names.
These Violets, especially the greater kind are called in Greek (...): in
Latin Violae albae; and is so called because his leaves be white, but not the
leaves of the flowers, for they be of diverse colors as is before said, they
be called in Italian Viola biancha in Spanish Violetas blancas. Some of the
late writers do call them Violae matronales, that is to say, Dames violets: but
this name does rather belong to an other sort of Violets, whereof we shall
entreat in the next Chapter following. But if we ought to call these Violets
by the aforesaid name, the name will best agree with the small Castle
Gilofer. The greater sort is called in English Garnesie Violets, white
Gilofer, Stock Gilofer, and Castle Gilofer the smaller kind, may be so
called also. The greater sort is called in base Almaigne Stock Vilieren, and
the smaller sort is also called of them Heeten Vilieren.

The Temperament.
These Violets are hoate and dry, and of nature somewhat like to Walfloures.

The Virtues.






Of Dames violets / or Gilofloures. Chap. v.
The Description.


De^tarias: whereof there be ij. sorts.

The first has five leaves or more, like hemp growing upon one little stem, the
stalks be small and short, not much above the height of nine inches: upon the^
grow small flowers of a violet color in proportion like to Garnesee violets or
Dames Gillofloures: after them comme husks and seed like to them. The roots
be somewhat thick, and uneven, and as they were covered with certain scales.

Violae Matronales.


The other his leaves grow along the little stalks, and are spread abroad
like to the leaves of the Aishe, or Walnut trees, saving they be smaller. The
flowers be almost white, and the husks or cods are like to the husks of
garnesey violets: the roots be rough and uneven, much like to the roots of
the first kind.

The Place.
The violets or Gillofers are very common almost in all gardens.

The Time.
They flower in May, and oftentimes else, whiles Somer lasts.

The Names.
These flowers be now called in Latin Violae Matronales: in English Damask
violets, Dames violets or Gillofers, and Rogues gillofers: in French Violettes
de Dames: in high Douch Winter violen, wherefore some do also call them in
Latin Hyberna viola, or Viola hyemalis: in base Almaigne Mastbloemen, and
after the Latin name they call it Ionefrouwen vilieren, which may be
Englished Dames violets.

The other kind is known by the name of Dentarie: and is not otherwise known
to us.

The Temperament and Virtues.
These flowers are not used in medicine, therefore their temperature, and
natural operation, is yet unknown.

Of Bolbanac / or strange Violets. Chap. vi.
The Description.




Viola Latifolia.


The Place.
This herb is found sown in certain gardens of this country.

The Time.
Bolbonac floureth in April and May, the next year after the sowing.

The Names.
Forasmuch as these flowers are somewhat like unto violets, therefore they are
now placed amongst the kinds of Violets, and are called in Latin Violae
Latifoliae, of some Violae peregrin. For under the name of (...) in Greek: and
Viola in Latin, are commonly comprehended all sorts of flowers which be any
thing like unto Violets. The Herboristes and certain Apothecaries do call this
herb by a certain barbarous and strange name Bolbonac: the Brabanders or base
Almaignes, do call it Penninckbloemen, that is to say, Penny flower, or money
flower, and they call it also Paeschbloemen. The Ancients did account it for a
kind of Thlaspie, especially for that kind descrybed by Crateuas, which some
do call Sinapi Persicum, and of Dioscorides Thlaspie Crateuae.

The Temperament and Virtues.
The seed of this herb is sharp and biteth the tongue, and of a drying
quality, and therefore is in virtue like the other Thlaspi.

Of Gillofers. Chap. vij.
The Kinds.
Under the name of Gillofers (at this time) diverse sorts of flowers are
contained. Whereof they call the first the Cloue gillofer which in deed is of
Diverse sorts and variable colors: the other is the small or single Gillofer
and his kind. The third is that, which we call in English sweet Williams, and
Colminiers: whereunto we may well join the wild Gillofer or Cockow flower,
which is not much unlike the smaller sort of garden Gillofers.

Vetonica altilis. Carnations, and the double-cloaue Gillofers.


Vetonica altilis minor. The single Gillofers, Soppes in wine, and Pinkes, etc.

whereof some be of color white, some carnation, or of a lively flesh color,
some be of a clear or bright read, some of a dark or deep read, and some
speckled, and do all smell almost like Cloves. When the flowers be past, there

of color sometimes red, and sometimes spotted with white, and sometimes (but
very seldom) all white.

There is an other kind of Armeriorum, whose leaves be broad, almost like the
leaves of flower Constantinople. The stalks of this kind, with the number of
small flowers growing together, which are of color read and white, and
speckled or sprinkled with small spots, are very like unto the aforesaid
Armerijs.

There is also a certain third kind Armeriorum, with thin whitishe or
faynte green leaves, and slender smooth knottie stalks, which in handling
seems to be somewhat fat or clammy, in the top of the said stalks grow
small flowers clustering or growing round together, of a fair washed purple
read color, after them comes narrow seed vessels, or small husks like as
in the other Gillofers, wherein the seed is contained.

Williams, and Colmeniers, are set and planted in the gardens of this country.
The wild Williams or Cockow gillofers, do grow of them selves in all meadows,
and moist grassie places.

The other kind of Armerius grows in Germany, in certain rough hilly
places that stand open against the Sun.

Keykens: of the Frenchmen des Armoires. There is a kind of this herb which is
common in the country gardens, and they call it Colmeniers.

Vetonica, and therefore it is called Vetonica syluestris: in English wild
Williams, Marshe gillofers, or Cockow gillofers: in high Douche Gauchblum: in
Brabant Crayebloemkens, and Coeckcoeckbloemkens: it may be called also in

Of flower Gentill / or purple Veluer flower. Cap. xviij.
The Description.






Amaranthus purpureus.


The Place.
These kinds of herbs grow not in this country, except they be sown or
planted in gardens. The women of Italy make great accoumpt of the second
kind, because of his pleasant beauty, so that ye shall not lightly come into
any garden there, that has not this herb in it.

The Time.
They bring forth their flowers, or spikie tuftes in August, and the seed is
ripe in September.

two kinds, whereof the one grows in gardens, and the other grows wild.

The Description.




Bellis mayor. The great wild Daysie, or Maudelynwurte.


Bellis minor hortensis. The small garden Daysie.




The Place.
The great Daysie, and the small wild Daysie, do grow in meadows, and moist
pastures. The fair double garden Daysie is planted and set in gardens.

The Time.
The great Daysie floureth most commonly in May. The small garden Daysie
floureth from May all the Summer long. The small wild Daysie floureth very
timely in March, and sometimes sooner, and continues flouring until April
and somewhat later.

These flowers are called of Pliny in Latin Bellis and Bellius, and now they
are called in Latin Consolida minor, and Herba Margarita. of some Primula
veris, (especially the small wild Daysie) in English Daysies: in French
Marguerites or Pasquettes in high Douch Maszlieben, Massuselen, and in some

The Temperament.
These flowers and herbs, are of nature cold and moist.

The Virtues and effects.








Of Canterbury Belles / or Haskewurte. Chap. xx.
The Kinds.
THere be diverse herbs which have flowers like Belles, whereof this
Throtewurte or Haskewurte is a kind, of which we shall speak in this
Chapter, and it is also of three sorts, that is to say, the great and small,
and the creeping kind.

The Description.
THe great Belfloure has square, rough, and hearie stalks, upon which grow
sharp poynted leaves, dented round about like to Nettell leaves, the flowers
grow along the stalks like Belles, and like the flowers of Rampions, but
far greater, and rough hearie within, of color sometimes white, sometimes
blew, and sometimes Carnation or flesh color. It begins to flower at the
top of the stalk and so goes florisshing downewarde. The flowers past, the
seed which is small and graye, comes up in long knoppie husks, like the
Rampion seed. The root is white and much wrythen and interlaced.

Trachelium maius. Great Haskewurte or Belfloure.


Trachelium minus. The less Haskewurte, or Belfloure.


Auicularia.






Auicularia, seeing that they be somewhat like to the flowers of Haskewurte or
Belfloure. The plant that bears these flowers grows to the height of a
hand breadth or twain, the stalks are small and tender, and set full of
small leaves. The flowers grow at the top of the stalks of a fair purple
color, almost fasshioned like a Bell or Cymball, with a small white clapper in
the middle. They open after Sun rising and close again toward Sun set:
and when they be close, they have five crestes or playtes like the Belfloures,
or Couentrie Marians, or wild Rapes, or like to Rampions, and such other
flowers before their opening.

The Place.




Auicularia grows in good ground, in fields amongst wheat, or where as
wheat has grown.

The Time.
They flower most commonly in July.

The Names.
Trachelium, Ceruicaria, and Vuularia, according to the Douch name: in English
they be called Belfloures, and of some Canterbury Belles. The Plant may be
very well called Haskewurte, or Throtewurte: in French Gantel'ee: in high Douch
Halszkraut: in base Almaigne Halscruyt: And they are like the kinds of
Rampions, as the Couentrie Marians violet or wild Rape is, whereof shall be
written here under.

Auicularia: the Brabanders call it Urouwen spiegel. And I know none other
name, except it be ye herb that is called in Greek (...): and in Latin
Onobrichis, that is to say the braying, or sounding again of the Ass,
whereunto it has some small proportion or similitude.

The Nature.
Belfloure is of a complexion cold and dry, like to Rampion, wherefore it may
be used in meat as the Rampions.

The Virtues.


Of Autumn Belfloures / or Calathian Violets. Chap. xxj.
The Description.
AMongst all ye kinds of Belfloures, there is none more beutiful in color
then this: it has small straight knottie stemmes, and at every knot or joint,
it has two leaves set directly one against an other, which be long and
narrow: by each side whereof, as also at the top of ye stalk, grows forth
pleasant flowers, which be long and hollow, always bending outwardes, like to
a small long bell, with two or three small white threedes in the middle. They
are of a blew color, so clear and excellent, that they seem to pass, the
azured skies. When they are paste, there comes up in the middle of the flower
a round long husk, full of long small seed.

Calathiana viola.


The Place.
These pleasant flowers grow in moist meadows, and low untilled grounds,
standing in fruitful soyles.

The Time.
They are in flower about the end of August and September.

The Names.
Pliny calls these flowers in Latin Campanulae Autumnales, and Viola
Autumnalis: we may also call them in English Autumn Belfloures, Calathian
violets, or Autumn violets: in high Douch they are called Lungen blume: for
the which cause Cordus calls them Pneumonanthe: and truly it seems to be a
certain kind of Gentian: in base Almaigne it is called blauw Leliekens, and
Duysent schoon.

The Temperament and Virtues.


Of Marians violet / or Couentrie Belles. Chap. xxij.
The Description.
THis brave and pleasant flower, has his first leaves which grow next the
ground, long, broad and somewhat hearie, not much unlike the leaves of wild
rose Campions, from the midst whereof springs up the second year after the
sowing or planting one stalk or more, full of branches, set with such like
leaves, but somewhat smaller: there grow upon the said branches, many fair and
pleasant hollow flowers, most commonly of a clear purple color, and sometimes
white, in proportion very well like to the common Belfloure, but much larger
and rounder, and not so deeply cut about the brimmes or edges, the which also
before their opening are folden together as it were with five crested playtes
or edges. When they are past there comes up small round buttons or husks,
with five rough ends, or tails, which be hollow, short, plied, or turned
back, in all things else like to the knops or husks of Rampion, or the common
Belfloure. The seed is in the middle of the said knoppie husks, and it is
small and broune, colored like a Chestnutte. The root is white and thick,
and puts forth by the sides diverse other roots.

Viola Mariana.


The Place.
These pleasant flowers grow about Couentrie in England, and are found sown
in the gardens of Herboristes, and are not yet very common.

The Time.
They flower from July until September, and afterward, and notwithstanding,
though they seem always to flower, yet they do also bear seed, so that
oftentimes as soon as this herb begins to flower, one may always find
upon the same buddes, flowers, and ripe seed.

The Names.
Men do now call these pleasant flowers in Latin Violae Marianae: that is to
say in English, Marianes violets, we may also call them Couentrie Rapes: in base
Almaigne Marietes: of the old writers in Greek (...). In Latin Rapum
syluestre. Of this kind also are ye Belfloures, described before in the xx.
Chapter of this Book.

The Nature.
These flowers, and their root specially are cold and dry.

The Virtues.


Stirpium aduersaria noua. Fol. 138.

They flower in June and July. And the wild does also flower until August.

The Names.
These flowers be now called Fair in sight: in French Belle videre: in Douch
Blauw clocxkens, that is to say in Latin Campanula caerulea. All these three
plants are very like that herb which is called of Theophrastus in Greek
(...), and in Latin of Pliny Iasione.

The Nature and Virtues.


Of Fox glove. Chap. xxiiij.
The Description.
Fox glove has long broad swartgreene leaves, somewhat dented about the
edges, and somewhat like the leaves of wild Mulleyne, amongst the which
springs up a straight round stem of two Cubits long or there about, by
one side whereof, from the middle to the very top, there grow fair long
round hollow flowers, fasshioned like finger stalles, of color sometimes
carnation, and speckled, in the inside with white spots, and sometimes all
white, and sometimes yellow. When they are fallen of, there appears round
sharpepoynted husks in which is contained the seed, of a bitter taste. The
root is black and full of threedy strings.

The Place.
It grows in stony places and mountains, in dark shadowie valleys or
coombes, where as there has been myning for Iron and Smithes cole. It is also
planted in certain gardens.

The Time.
Fox glove floureth chiefly in July and August.

Digitalis.


The Names.
This herb is now called in Latin Digitalis, Campanula syluestris, and Nola
syluestris: in English Fox glove: in French Gantz nostre Dame, and Digitale:
in high Douch Fingerhut, Fingerkraut, Waldt glocklin, and Waldt schell: in base
Almaigne Vingerhoetcruyt. This as some do write, is that kind of Verbascu^,
which the Greeks call (...), of the Latinistes Lychnitis, and Thryallis,
whereunto it is much like.

The Nature.
Fox glove is hoate and dry.

The Virtues.




Of Turkey / or Aphrican Gilofers. Chap. xxv.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of these flowers found in this country: one great and the
other small, the great (Othanna) grows to the height of a man, and floureth
very late. The small grows low, and floureth betimes.

The Description.
Athanasia or garden Tansie. The flowers grow at ye end of the branches, out
of long round husks, of a brown Ore^ge color above, and of a faint or pale
yelow underneath. After the falling of the flowers, the seed which is
enclosed in the aforesaid round husks, is long, narrow and black.



Flos Aphricanus.


The Place.
These flowers grow in Aphrica, and from thence they where brought into this
country, after that the mighty and Noble Emperor Charles the fifth, wan the
Town and Country of Thunes, they are planted here in gardens.

The Time.


Othonna begins not to flower before August.

The Names.
This flower may be called in Latin Flos Aphricanus, for it was first brought
out of Aphrica into the countries of Germany and Brabant. We do call this
flower Turkey Gillofers, and French Marygoldes, Aphrican flowers, or Aphrican
Gillofers: the French men do call these flowers Oillets de Turque, and Oillet
d'Inde: and from thence it comes to pass that the Latinists do call it Flos
Indianus: in high Douch Indianisch Negelin: in base Almaigne Thuenis bloemen:
of Valerius Cordus Tanaceum perunianu^. Some learned men think that this herb
has been called of the Ancient writers (...), Othonna, and that it should be
the Othonna, whereof Dioscorides has written, which grows in Arabia about
Egypt, whose leaves be holy, asthough they had been eaten with Locustes,
Pausmers or Snayles, which thing almost may pe perceived in the leaves of this
Indian Gillofer, if a man look upon them against the light. But in my
judgment it is better like to be that herb, which Galen in his fourth book
of Symples calls Lycopersium, or Lycopersion.

The vile Nature and evil quality of this Herb.
The Indian Gillofer is very dangerous, hurtful, and venomous, both to man and
beast, as I have tried by experience, namely upon a young Catt, whereunto I have
given of these flowers to eat, very finely pound with green or fresh Cheese:
whereupon she blasted immediately, and shortly after died. And I was moved to
make this experience, by the occasion of a young child who had gathered of
these flowers and put them into his mouth, so that straight ways his mouth and
lips did swell exceedingly and within a day or two after, they became very
sore and scabbed, as also it does often happen to them, that put into their
mouths the pipes, or hollow stalks of Hemlocke. Wherefore it is manifest that
this herb with his flower is very evil and venomous, and of complexion much
like unto Hemlocke, the which also may be partly perceived by his foul and
loathsome savor, which is very strong and stinking, not much differing from
the rank and noysom smell of Hemlocke.

Of May Lilly / or Lilly Conuall. Also of Monophillon. Chap. xxvj.
The Description.
Lilly Conuall has two green smooth leaves, like to the leaves of ye common
white Lilly but smaller and tenderer, betwixt which there springs up a
naked stalk of a span long, or thereabout, at the which stalk there hangs
seven or eight, or more, proper small flowers, as white as Snow, and of a
pleasant strong savor, smelling almost like the Lilly. When the flowers be
past, their comes in their steed certain read bearies, like to the fruit
or bearies of garden Asparagus. The root is threedishe, creeping here and
there.

It should seem that Monophillon were a kind of Lylie Conuall, it has a
leaf not much unlike the greatest leaves of Iuie, with many ribs or sinews
along the same, like to a Plantayne leaf: the which one leaf, or single
leaf, does always spring up out of the ground alone, saving when the herb
is in flower and seed: for than it bareth two leaves upon a round tender
stalk like to the other, but smaller and standing one above an other, above
the said leaves grows the small white flowers like to Lylie Conuall, but not
of so strong a savor, after which there rises small bearies or round fruit,
which is white at the first and afterward read. The root is very slender
and creeps in the ground.

The Place.
Lyllie Conuall and Monophillon, growth in shadowie wooddes.

The Time.
They do both flower in May.

Lilium Conuallium. Lilly Conuall.


Vnifolium. Monophillon.


The Names.
Lilium conuallium, that is to say, the Lyllie of the vallie: in English Lyllie
conuall, May blossoms, May lyllies, and Lyryconfancy: in French Grand Muguet:
in high Douch Meyenblumlin: in base Almaigne Meybloemkens.

Vnifolium: it may be also called in English, one Leaf, one Blade, or
Singleleafe: in high Douch Einblat: and in base Almaigne Eenbladt, and it
should seem to be a kind of Lilly conuall, seeing that it is so well like
unto it in flowers and seed.

The Nature.
They be in complexion, hoate and dry, like the Lillies.

The Virtues.










Of Calfes snowte / or Snap Dragon. Chap. xxvij.
The Kinds.
THere are in this country two sorts of this herb, the one great and the
other small. The great has broad leaves, and it is the true Antirrhinum of
Dioscorides. The smaller kind has long narrow leaves.

Antirrhinon. The great snap Dragon, or Calves snowte.


Orontium. Small Calves snowte.


The Description.


There is also an other kind of great Antirrhinum, whose leaves belong and
narrow, almost like to the leaves of Tode flax, which bears sometimes a red flower, sometimes a faint read, and sometimes a white flower: else in
all things like to the above said.

branches, his leaves be long and narrow, betwixt which and the stalks,
grow the small red flowers, like to the aforesaid flowers, but a great deal
smaller. When they are past, there rises up small round heads or knappes,
with little hooles in them, like to a dead scull, within which is contained
small seed.

The Place.


The Time.
The great Antirrhinum floureth in August and July. The small Antirrhinum
bears flowers in July.

The Names.
Antirrhinum, and Syluestris Anagallis: in English Calfes snowte, and
Snapdragon: in French Grand Antirrhinum, and Moron violet: in Douch Orant, and
of some Calves nuese.

Orontium: in English small Snapdragon, or Calves snowte: in French Petit
Antirrhinum: in Douch cleyne Orant, of this kind Galen has made mention in
lib 9. de Medicamentis secundum loca, amongst the Medicines which Archigenes
made for them that have the Iaunders. And it seems to be ye Phyteuma of
Dioscorides, called in Greek (...).

The Nature.
Aster Atticus, called in English Sharewurte, as Galen writes.



The Virtues.




Of water lyllie. Chap. xxviij.
The Kinds.
THere be two kinds of water Lyllies, that is to say, the yellow, and the
white, not only differing in flower but also in root.

spongie substance, of the greatness of ones arm, full of knobbes and knottes,
with certain great stringes hanging by it.

Nymphaea alba. White water Lilly.


Nymphaea lutea. Yellow water Lilly.


The Place.
These flowers do grow in Rivers and Pooles, and other standing waters.

The Time.
Water Lilly floureth in June, and sometimes sooner.

The Names.
Nymphaea, of some Clauus Veneris, and Papauer palustre: of the Apothecaries
Nenuphar: in English White water Lilly, Water Rose, and white Nenuphar: in
Italian Nenuphar biancho: in Spanish Adarguas del Rio, Escudettes del Rio,
Figuos del Rio blanquos: in French Nenuphar blanc, or Blanc d'eaue: in high
Douch Seeblumen, wasser Gilgen, Wassermahen, Horwurtz, Horftang: in Brabant

Dioscorides writes, is called in Greek (...), Blephara.

The Nature.
Both sorts of Nenuphar, and specially the root are in temperature cold and
dry without any acrimonie or sharpness.

The Virtues.




Pliny writes, if it be bruised and applied outwardly to the secret parts.







Theoplirastus writes.



Of Chamomill. Chap. xxix.
The Kinds.
CAmomill, as Dioscorides and other of the Ancients have written, is of three
sorts. The one has white flowers. The other has yellow flowers. And the
third which is the greatest of the three, has flowers betwixt read and
purple. Yet at this time there be diverse other sorts found, and first there be
two sorts of Chamomill which are very sweet and of strong savor, called
Roman Camomill. The one has white flowers, the other yellow, and bysides
these there be others, which do (for the most part) grow in deserte places,
and therefore we have named them Camomill of the Forest, or wilderness.

The Description.




Of the number of these two kinds, there is yet an other, which has small
yellow leaves growing round about the small yellow knoppes or buttons, and
are altogether like to the first, in leaves, savor, and fasshion, saving his
flowers be altogether yellow.

These two kinds of Camomil (that is to say) the white and the yellow, have a
very pleasant savor, like the smell of a Cytron, whereof they first took
their name in Greek Chamaemelum.

Chamaemelum leucanthemum. White Roman Camomill.


Chamaemelum chrysantemum. Yellow Roman Camomill.


flos Adonis, and other Anemone.

The Place.
None of the sweet Roman Camomils grows in this country, of their own
kinds, but are planted in the gardens of some diligent Herboristes, and are
come hither as strangers.

The Time.
These Camomils do flower in June, and July, and sometimes also sooner. They
last all the winter, and may very well abide the cold.

The Names.
The Camomill is also called in Greek (...): in Latin Chamaemelum, and as
Apuleius writes Been olens, at this day Camomilla: in English Camomill: in
French Camomille: in Douch Camille.

Chamaemelum album: in base Almaigne Roomsche Camille: in English white
Camomill: in French Camomille blanch.

Chrysanthemum, and Chamaemelum luteum: in English Yelow Camomill: in French
Camomille iaulne: in Douch geele Roomsche Camille.

Eranthemum, and Chamaemelum purpureum. It may be called in English Purple
Camomill: in French Camomille a fleur purpuree: in Douch Roode Camille.

The Temperament.
The Camomill, especially the white, is hoate and dry in the first degree, and
has power to dissolve, and make subtle. But the Roman Camomils are hoater,
and more drying.

The Virtues.


















Of wild or common Camomill. Chap. xxx.
The Kinds.
THere are four kinds of wild Camomill. The first kind is the common
Camomill: the second is the Cotula foetida: the third is the great wild
Camomill called Cotula non foetida: the fourth is the wild Camomill with the
yellow flowers called in Latin Cotula Lutea.

The Description.


Cotula foetida, has a thick green stem, and full of juice, which
breaks quickly when it is trodden upon. The leaves Chamaemelum, Leucanthemum
commune and syluestre. The common wild Camomill.
Cotula foetida. Mathers or stinking Camomill.
be greater and greener than the leaves of the common Camomill. The flowers be
much like unto the aforesaid. The whole herb is of a very strong unpleasant
stinking savor, and of a sufficient bitter taste.

Cotula non foetida, has small tender pliant stems, many growing up from one
root, the leaves be long, greater and whiter than the leaves of the common
Camomill. The flowers are like to the two kinds aforesaid, but they are a
great deal greater and without any manifest smell. The root is great and very
threddie, the which dies not lightly at winter but springs up yearly a new.

Cotula non foetida in his stalks, leaves, and flowers saving that his leaves
be greater and whiter, drawing toward Asshie color, and his flowers be not
only yellow in the middle, but also they are set round about with small yellow
leaves, in fashion like the other Camomilles, and without smell like to Cotula
no^ foetida. Also it does not lightly die or decay, but springs up yearly
out of the old roots.

The Place.
The iij. first kinds do grow most commonly in this country in every corn
field.

The golden Cotula grows in such like places in France and Germany, but not
in this country, except in the gardens of Herbozistes.

The Time.
All these kinds of Camomill do flower in June, and from thence forth all the
Somerlong.

Cotula non foetida. Unsavory Maydeweede.


Cotula lutea. Golden Cotula.


The Names.
The first kind of wild Camomill is now called Chamaemelum album: in Shoppes
Chamomilla, whereas it is aptly used for Leucanthemum: in English common
Camomill: in Italian Camamilla: in Spanish Macella, Manzamilla. in French
Camomille vulgaire: in high Douch Chamill. Albeit this is not the right
Camomill. Wherefore we call it Chamaemelum syluestre, that is to say, wild
Camomill.

Cotula foetida, of some Cauta and Camomilla foetida, and in Greek (...),
Cynanthemis, and (...), Cynobotane, that is to say, Dogs Camomill: in Italian
Drusaculo: in Spanish Maguarca: in high Douch Krottendill, Hunszdill,
Hundszblum, and wild Chamill: in Brabant Paddebloemen, and stinckende or wild
Camille: in English Mathers, Mayweede, Dogs Camomill, Stinking Camomill, and
Dog Fenell: and peradventure it is Parthemium mucrophyllon of Hippocrates.

Cotula non foetida, Camomilla fatua, and Camomilla inodora, of some in Greek
(...), Buphthalmum, that is to say in Latin, Oculus bouis: in high Douch
Kudill, and Rundsaug and Kueaug: in French Oeil de beuf: howbeit this is not
the right Buphthalmum, as one may see in the Chapters following, and therefore
it may better be called Cotula non foetida, or Cotula alba, than to call it by
a name not belonging unto it. I have Englished it Unsavory Camomill, foolish
Mathes, and white Cotula without savor.

Cotula lutea, seeing it is so well like unto the Cotules abouesaide: in English
Golden Cotula: in high Douch Streichblumen, and Steinblumen, and according to
the same it is called in base Almaigne Strijck bloemen. Some which think that
this is the second kind of Camomill, do call it Chrysanthemum, that is to say;
yellow Camomill: in French Camomille iaulne: in high Douch geel Camille, but
they are deceived, and their opinion is not like to be true, because this herb
has no special smell. Moreover the fasshion of the leaves is nothing like to
the leaves of garden Camomill, neither yet like the common Camomill.

The Temperament.


Cotula foetida is hoate and dry, as his smell and savor declares.



The Virtues.








Cotula foetida is good for such women, whose Matrix is loosed, and falling
down from one side to another, if one do wash their feet with a decoction
thereof made in water.

Castorium, as the learned writers of our time have found out by experience.





Of Pass flower / or fiedde Mathes. Chap. xxxi.
The Description.
THis herb has thick green stalks, and leaves very small cut and iagged,
much like both in stalks and leaves, and also in smell and savor, unto
Cotula foetida. The flower is of a fair purple red color, of fasshion and
making like unto the gold cup, or the flower of Crowfoote: when they are past,
there come up round rough knops, like ye knops of Crowfoote, but somewhat
longer, wherein is the seed (like to Spinache seed).

The Place.
These fair and pleasant flowers grow in some places in the common corn
fields as in Prouence and Languedoc, and in some places of England, in some
countries they grow not but in gardens.

The Time.
This herb begins to flower in May, and remains flouring all the Somer.

Heranthemum forte.


The Names.
The stalks and leaves with the whole herb that bears these flowers, which
is like unto some of the Camomilles in savor, smell, and proportion, are
sufficient enough to prove this herb to be a kind of Camomill, and especially
the third kind called Heranthemum: the flowers only, which are not very
like unto Camomill flowers, causes me to doubt. For if the flowers were like
fasshioned unto Camomill, I would without doubt maintain this herb to be the
third kind of Camomill, which is the true Heranthemum, which Dioscorides
describes to be greater than the two other kinds, and to have a purple
flower, unto which description this herb draws near, saving only in the
fasshion of his flower. For the whole plant is greater and higher then
Camomill, but otherwise very like it, and the flowers be of a fair purple red
color. But whatsoever this herb is, it is better like to be the third kind
of Camomill, than Consolida regia, which we call Larckes spur, is, or Aster
Atticus which we call Sharewurte, which have been both described of some
writers for this kind of Camomill, although they were nothing like Camomill,
neither in their leaves, flowers, nor smell, and they bear not read flowers
but blew, which is against the description of Heranthemum, whose flowers (as
it is above said) Dioscorides writes to be of a red purple color. Wherefore
this herb may better be called Heranthemum, then either Larckes spur, or
Shareworte: it may be called in English purple Camomill, Read Mathes, and
Pass flower: it is also called in French Pass fleur: the Brabanders call it
Bruynettekens.

Some would have it to be flos Adonis, but their opinion seems not to be very
likely, because that Flos Adonis should seem to be none other, then a kind of
Anemone.

The Temperament.
The taste and smell of this herb does manifestly declare it to be of
complexion hoate and dry like the Camomill, but chiefly like to Cotula foetida.

The Virtues.
Heranthemum, it is singular against the stoone, as we have already written in
the xxix. Chapter of this Book.

Of Buphthalmos / or Ox eye. Chap. xxxij.
The Description.
BUphthalmos is a brave plant, with pleasant flowers and stems, of a span or a
half cubite long: it has three or four stalks, set with tender leaves very
small cut and iagged, not much unlike unto Fenell leaves, but a great deal
smaller, and very well like to the leaves of the small Sothrenwood, saving they
be greener. The flower is of a fair bright yellow color, and large, with many
small thrommes or yellow thredes in the middle, almost like to the flowers of
Marigoldes saving they be much larger, and have not so many small leaves set
round about the golden knops or yellow heads. The flower perisshed, there
comes in steed thereof a round knop almost like the sedie knop of Pass
flower, the root is black and very thredie.

The Place.
This herb as witnesses Dioscorides grows in ye fields without the town:
in this country the Herboristes do plant it in their gardens.

Buphthalmum.


The Time.
It bears his flowers in March and April.

The Names.
This herb because of his flowers, which be of the quantity and fashion of
an Ox eye, is called in Greek (...): in Latin Buphthalmum, and Oculus bouis:
in high Douch Rindszaug, Kuaug: in base Almaigne Rundsooge, and Coeooghe: some
call it also Cachla, Cauta, or Caltha. This is the right Ox eye described by
Dioscorides.

In certain places the Apothecaries do sell, and use the roots of this plant
in steed of the root of black Hellebor, and from hence it comes that
certain studious Herboristes have called this plant Helleborum nigrum, and do
count it for a very naughty and vehement plant, howbeit that of it self it
has not in it any special malice or force, neither will it provoke the stool
as some have proved by experience. Therefore some have called it Helleborine
tenuifolia: some others call it Helleborastrum, or Consiligo, whereunto it is
nothing like.

The Temperament.
Buphthalmos or Ox eye is hoate and dry, of a more sharper and cutting nature
than Camomill.

The Virtues.


Dioscorides and Serapio) that Buphthalmos or Ox eye cures the Iaunders, and
causes the body to be of good color, if one drink it boiled in wine, after
his coming out of a bath.

Of Goldenfloure / or the wild Marygolde. Chap. xxxiij.
The Description.


Dioscorides his Chrysanthemum: as it does when it grows in some other
places, whereas it bears leaves, very much cloven and iagged, and than it is
agreeable in all respects to the true description of Chrysanthemum.

Chrysanthemon.


The Place.
This herb grows amongst the Corn, and in householde gardens amongst other
herbs, and by the high way sides.

The Time.
It begins to flower in June, and from thence forth almost until winter.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...), and in Latin Chrysanthemum, that is to
say, Goldenfloure, and Caltha, and of some Buphthalmum: in Italian Chrispula
herba: in Spanish Mequeres amarillo: in French Camomille Saffranee: in high
Douch S. Iohans blum, and Gensblum: in base Almaigne Vokelaer, geel
Gansebloemen, Hontsroosen: unknown in shoppes as many other good herbs be.

The Nature.
This herb is hoate and dry, not much differing from Camomill.

The Virtues.
Chrysanthemum boiled in wine, cures the Iaunders, and restores good color,
when one does drink it, after that he has been often and long in the bath.







Of the Indian Sun / or Golden flower of Perrowe. Chap. xxxiiij.
The Description.
THe Indian Sun, or the golden flower of Perrowe is a plant, of such
stature and tallness, that in one Somer it grows to the length of thirtene or
fouretenne foot, and in some places to the height of four and twenty, or
five and twenty foot, his stalks be right straight and thick, and his leaves
are very many, especially they that grow vpmost, for the under leaves do
quickly fall and vanissh: especially those great broad leaves which before
the springing up of the stalk, are in quantity almost as large as the leaves
of the Clote Burre. In the very top of the said high stalk there grows a
very large and most excellent flower most likest to Camomill, or Chrysanthemum,
but much larger, and in quantity almost like to apretie broad Hatte, so that
oftentimes when the circuit, or uttermost Compass of the said flower is
measured, it is found to be of the breadth of half a foot. The middle of the
flower in which the seed grows, is like to a fine cloth wrought as it were
with needle work: the small leaves which grow in compass about, are of a
bright shining yellow color, and every one of them are in quantity like the
leaves of the Lyllie flowers, or rather greater, and are almost fifty in
number or more. The seed is flat and long, and somewhat brown or swarte, in
quantity like to the Gourde seed. The roots are like to the roots of Reeds
or Canes.

Chrysanthemum Peruuianum.


The Place.
This plant grows in the Weste India, the which is called America, and in
the Country of Perrowe: and being sown in Spain, it grows to the length of
four and twenty foot, and it bears flowers like to the above said: in
base Almaigne it grows not above xij. or xiij. foot high, and it does
scarfly bring forth his flower, and if it chance sometimes to bear his
flowers, yet than they be smaller and very little, and they come forth against
winter, so that they can come to no perfection.

The Names.
This flower is called Sol Indianus, and Chrysanthemum Perunianum: in base
Almaigne Son van Indien: we may also call it the Indian Sun, or the Golden
flower of Perrowe.

The Nature and Virtues.
Of the virtue of this herb and flower, we are able to say nothing, because
the same has not been yet found out, or proved of any man.

Of Flower Deluce / or Iris. Chap. xxxv.
The Kinds.
THere be many kinds of Iris, or flower Deluce: whereof some are great and
tal, and some are little and small. The greater sorts are known one from an
other by their colors, and so be also the smaller sorts. There is also a
certain kind with narrower blades, in savor somewhat loathsome or grievous,
almost of the savor of Spatulae foetidae, or Gladyn, bysides the Dwarffe
Ireos, the stinking Iris, and the yellow Iris.

The Description.








Iris.






fadder, and in some lighter.

Spatula foetida. The stemmes grow to the height of half a foot, at the
tops whereof grow clear blewe or sky colored flowers, like to the other
flower Deluces, saving that their little leaves are smaller and narrower, and
the upper leaves do not bend inward, one toward another. After the said
flowers follow certain triangled great coddes or husks, separating them
selves into three parts when they are ripe: in them is plain sede which is
very thick and flat or thrust together. The roots also grow crokedly like the
others, but they be smaller, hard, and knottie, in the outsyde of a Chestnut
color, and white within, or somewhat yellowe.

The Place.






But the brauest of them, with the flowers twixt purple and violet, comes to
us from Spain and Portingale.





The Time.
The Irides or flower Deluces do most commonly flower about May: and the
smaller somewhat before the others, and the narrow leaued flower Deluce last of
all. But in Portingal and Spain they flower at the later end of Autumn, a
little before winter.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...), and as Atheneus, and Theophrastus write
(...): in Latin, Iris, Consecratix, Radix Naronica.

Iris Germanica: in Shops, Iris, of others Lilialis, and Spatula: in English
also Iris: and of some blew flower Deluce: and garden flagges: in Italian,
Giglio azuro Giglio celeste: in Spanishe, Lirio Cardeno: in high Douche, Blauw
Gilgen, Blauw Schwertel, Himmel Schwertel: in base Almaigne, Blauw Lisch: in
French, Flambe.

Iridem florentinam: in Shoppes, Ireos, (especially the dried roots) by the
which name it is known of the Clothworkers and Drapers: for with these roots
they use to trim their clothes to make them sweet and pleasant: in English,
White flower Deluce, and of some. Iris florentine: and the roots be commonly
called Ireos: in Italian, Giglio bianche: in French, Flambe blanch: in high
Douch, Violwurtz, weisz Violwurtz: in nether Douchland, Wit Lisch: and the
roots of this white flower Deluce, are judged for the best Ireos, especially
when we shall have need to use of the dried roots.

That kind which bears the fair purple flower, is now called in Latin,
Lusitanica Iris, and Iris ferotina, that is to say, Portingale Iris, and late
Iris: in Douche, Spade Lisch, and Lisch van Portegall.

Iris angustifolia, or Iris tenuifolia, and Iris Caerulea: in English, Narrow
bladed Ireos: in high Douche, Blo Schwertel, that is, blewe Lilly.

The Nature.
The Ireos roots being yet green and new gathered, are hoate and dry in the
third degree, and they burn in the mouth or throat when they are tasted: but
when they be dry they are ever or always hoate but in the second degree:
nevertheless they be ever dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.




















The choice.
The best and most convenient in medicine, are the Ireos roots which grow in
Sclauonia: the next is the Iris of Macedonia, and the third best is that
which grows in Africa, as Dioscorides and Pliny write, but the African
Ireos is much discommended of Galen. At this day the white Ireos is taken for
the best, especially the Ireos of Florence, which is called in shops Ireos,
and Ireos Florentina of the base Almaignes.

Of small flower Deluce / or dwarffe Ireos. Chap. xxxvi.
The Description.
THat kind of flagge, which we do now call the small flower Deluce, has
narrow long blades, almost like the leaves of the right Gladin, but of a
browner green, and somewhat thicker. The stalks are shorter tha^ the leaves,
but only of a span long, the which do bear two or three small flowers upon
short ste^s, standing all together at the very top of the said stalks, and
not one above an other as other Flagges. These flowers are almost like the
flowers of the other flagges, saving that they be smaller, and the three first
leaves that hang downward, have not such hearie strakes or lines as are to be
perceived in the other flower Deluces. Their color for the most part is a
clear blewe, straked in certain places with small lines and points, of white
and yellow, along the sides of the leaves that hang downewardes. They be of a
pleasant savor, sweeter and stronger than any of the other flower Deluces. The
root is hard, brown without, and white within.

Chamae-iris.


The Place.
This kind of a flagge is found in this country in the gardens of
Herboristes.

The Time.
It floureth here in May and June.

The Names.
This flower Deluce may well be called in Greek (...), Chamaeiris: that is to
say, Dwarffe Ireos, or the smallest flower Deluce, because it is the least of
all the flagges. The Herboristes do now call it Iris Illyrica. And so does also
Hermolaus Barbarus in Corollario. But Antonius Musa in Examine Simpliciu^, does
very well declare, that this is not Iris Illyrica.

The Temperament and Virtues.
This Flagge also is hoate and dry, leaving (when it is chewed) a certain
heat upon the tongue, as the roots of all the other flagges do.

Of wild Ireos / stinking Gladin / or Spourgewort. Chap. xxxvij.
The Description.
The stinking flagge or Gladyn has long narrow bladed leaves like to the
leaves of Ireos or the flower Deluce, but a great deal smaller and of a dark
green color, of a loathsome smell or stincke, almost like unto the stinking
worm called in Latin Cimex. The stalk is round, upon which grows flowers
like to the flower Delice, but smaller and of a gray, or ashye color: when
they are gone, there appear great husks or coddes, wherein is round red
seeds, each grain or bearie of the quantity of a little round pease. The
root is long and very threedy.

The Place.
This herb is a stranger in Brabant, for it is seldom found in that country
out of the gardens of Herboristes. It is very common in England, especially
near to the sea side, growing in stony places by hedges and the borders of
woods.

The Time.
It floureth in August, and the seed is ripe in September.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Xyris, and Iris syluestris: in
Shoppes Sphatula foetida: in Spanishe Lirio Spadanal: in English Stinking
gladyn, Spourgeworte, and wild Ireos: in French Glaieul puante: in high
Douche Welsch Schwertel, Wandtleuszkraut: in base Almaigne Wa^dtluyscruyt,
wild Lisch, and stinckende Lisch.

The Nature.
It is hoate and dry in the third degree, of power to cut and make subtle.

Xyris.


The Virtues.






Cimici, if the place whereas they haunt or engender, be rubbed with the juice
thereof.

Corn flagge / or Gladioll. Chap. xxxviij.
The Description.
THis Gladyn or Corn flag has long narrow blades, like to the blades of
Ireos, and the rest of the flagges, but a great deal smaller and narower,
amongst the which there springs up a round stalk of a cubite long, at the
top whereof there hangs in order fair purple flowers, one above an other,
after which there comes roundish husks, divided in three parts, almost
like to the husks of Hyacinthe or Iacinthe, in which the seed is contained.
The root is like unto two round bullettes set one upon an other.

The Place.
This Gladyn is not found in this country, but in the garde^s of Herborists.

The Time.
This Gladyn floureth in this country in May and June.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...), and of some (...): in Latin, Gladiolus,
of Apuleius Gladiolus segetalis, and Lingua ceruina: unknown in shops: in
Italian, Monacuccie. in Spanish, Gladiolo di entres los panes, of some
Victorialis: in Douche, Aller man^ harnisch: we may call it in English, Corn
Gladin: Corn flag, and right Gladin.

The Nature.
The root of Corn Gladin, especially the uppermost, does dry and make
subtle, and has a little drawing quality, as Galen writes.

The Virtues.






Gladiolus.


Of Sisynrichion. Chap. xxxix.
The Description.
SIsynrichion has two or three long, narrow, little leaves, from which grow up
round stems, about half a foot long, on the tops of them, grow very fair
little flowers of a light blew or sky color, so growing by course one after
the other, the one of them is ever open and spread, and that stands always
at the top, in fashion almost like the flowers of Ireos, but smaller, and
somewhat differing in proportion. After the said little flowers there appear
small, long, round knops or husks, wherein the seed grows. The root does
almost make two round heads, like Onyons or Bulbos, most commonly placed one
upon another, which are enclosed as it were in certain little houses.

The Place.
This plant grows in Portingale and Spain: and is very seldom found in
Flaunders, saving in the garde^s of some diligent Herboristes.

Sisynrichium.


The Names.
The Grecians call this plant (...): it is called also in Latin of Pliny,
Sisynrichium: in Shoppes, and Portingal, Nozelhals.

The Nature and Virtues.
Sisynrichium is of a temperate complexion, and good to be eaten: The
Auncientes did account it amongst the number of roots that may be eaten, and
the Spaniardes and Portingales at this day, do use it for food or meat.

Of Ireos Bulbosa. Chap. xl.
The Kinds.
There are found three kinds of Iris Bulbosa.

The Description.






Bulbosa Iris.


The Place.




The Time.
The flowers of these strange plants, do show them selves commonly in June,
in base Almaigne where as they are scantly known or hardly found, saving in
the gardens of some diligent Herboristes.

The Names.
This flower is called now in Latin, Bulbosa Iris, because it has a Bulbus
root, and a flower like Ireos. But it seems to be Apuleius Bulbus, called in
Greek (...), and Hieribulbus: they call this plant in Spain, especially that
with the yellowe flower Reilla Buen: and we may call it Bulbus Ireos in English.

The Nature and Virtues.
The nature of this kind of Bulbus or flower, with his virtues are not yet
known, because there is no experience made of it as yet.

Of the yellowe wild Ireos / or Flower Deluce. Chap. xli.
The Description.
THe wild yellow Iris or flower Deluce, has long narrow flagges or blades,
almost like to the right Iris or garden flagge, but a great deal longer and
narrower very like to the blade of a long and narrow double edged sword. The
stalks be round, smooth, and holow, at the top whereof grows the yellowe
flower with the three leaves hanging downewardes, like to ye garden flower
Deluce, and three mounting vpwardes, but they are smaller the^ the leaves yt
ha^g downewardes. When they are past there come up thick triangled coddes or
husks, in which is contained large yellow seed. The root is thick and
spreads here and there, and sometimes it has other small roots hanging by
it, and many threddy strings, of a fleshly color within, and of a rough
astringent or binding taste.

The Place.
This wild yellowe Iris grows in moist places, and low meadows, and in the
borders and brinkes of Rivers, pondes, and lakes: very common in England,
Flaunders, and other Countries.

Pseudoiris Lutea.


The Time.
This flower Deluce or wild Iris flowreth in May and June.

The Names.
The wild yellow Iris is now called in Latin, Pseudoiris Lutea: and of some
Syluestris Iris lutea, it has been called in Shoppes, Acoron, and has been
taken in medicine for the same, not without great error, loss, and danger of
the sick, as it is of diverse learned men now very well noted: and for that
cause it is also called Pseudoacorus, that is to say, false or bastard Acorus:
in Douch, Geel Schwertel, geel wald Schwertel, and Drakenwurtz: in base
Almaigne, Geel wilt Lisch, and Box boonen: in French, Glayeul bastard, and
Flambe bastard: in English, the yellow wild Iris, the yellow flower Deluce,
Wild flagges, water flagges, and Lauers, or Leuers.

The Nature.
The yellowe bastard Iris his root is cold and dry in the third degree,
and of astringent or binding faculty, like to the roots of Tormentill and
Bistorte,

The Virtues.
blood from whence so ever it flows, and women's flowers in what sort soever
it be taken, yea if it be ministered but outwardly only either in playsters or
in bathes.

Of the white Lilly. Chap. xlij.
The Description.
THe white Lilly his leaves be long and broad, and somewhat thick or fat,
amongst ye which springs up a straight stem or stalk of three foot long
or more, set and garnished with leaves from the root to the top, which by
little and little as they grow up toward the top, do wax smaller, and smaller.
In the top of the said garnished stem grow the pleasant, beautiful, white,
and sweet smelling Lillies, divided into six small, long, and narrow leaves,
which have in the outsyde of every leaf, a certain struck or ribbe, but
within they are altogether of an excellent shynyng and pure white color,
bending somewhat backwardes at the top, in the middle amongst these leaves,
there hang upon six very small stems, six small yellow points or little marks,
as it were tongues, in the middle amongst these also, there grows another
long upright and triangled stem, thicker then the rest, and like to the
Clapper of a Bell. The root is like to a great Onyon, or rather a garlike head
compacte and made of diverse cloves or kernelles.

The Place.
The white Lillies be very common not only in this Country, but in all places
else where in gardens,

Lilium Candidum, etc.


The Time.
This kind of Lillies does flower at the beginning of June or there about.

The Names.
The white Lilly is called of the Grecians (...), of some (...), and (...):
the plant is called (...). It is called in Latin, Lilium, and Rosa lunonis:
in Shoppes, Lilium album: in Italian, Giglio, and Giglio biancho: in Spanish,
Azucena in Douche, Weisz Gilgen, or weisz Lilgen: in French, Lys blanc.

The cause of the Name.
Constantine writes this of the Lilly, that when Jupiter had begotten
Hercules upon Alcumena, and being desirous to make him immortal, he carried
him to suck Juno his wife, whiles she was sleeping, and when he perceived the
child to have sucked his fill, he drew him from her breast, by means whereof
there fell great store of milk from the breasts of Juno, the greatest part
whereof was spilt in heaven and fell upon the Skies, whereof the sign and
mark remains at this day, that is to say, that white and milkie way that
goes through heaven, from the North to the South (called in Latin Via
lactea): The rest fell upon the earth, whereof sprang these Lillies, in the
flowers whereof, there remains the very whiteness of the said milk: and
hereof it came to pass, that this flower was called in Latin Iunonis rosa,
that is to say, Iunos rose.

The Nature.
The flowers of the white Lilly are hoate, and partly of a subtle substance.
The root is dry in the first degree, and hoate in the second.

The Virtues.
Pliny says.



















Of the Orange color / and read purple Lillies. Chap. xliij.
The Kinds.
THere be three kinds of read or purple Lillies, whereof the first is the
small and common red Lily, the second is great, and the third is of a
mean sise or quantity.

The Description.


spots, or little poynted marks as the other. The root is also like the
other, saving it is somewhat smaller.



The Place.
These kinds of Lillies are planted in some gardens, especially in Flaunders
and Germany, but in some countries they grow wild in rough and hard places.

The Time.
They flower in May and June.

The Names.
The red purple Lilly is called in Greek (...): in Latin Lilium rubrum,
Lilium rufum: and of Ouide it is called Hyacinthus. Pausanias calls one of
these kinds Comosandalon: the Italians Giglio saluatico, and some call the
greatest kind Martagon: it is called in Douche Root golt Gilgen.

Liliu^ purpureu^.


The cause of the Name.
Of the red Lilly Ouide writes this, that it came of the blood of the Boy
Hyacinthus, the which Apollo (by misfortune slew) in playing with him, so as
the grass and herbs were bedewed and sprinkled with the blood of him.
Whereupon it came to pass immediately by the commandment of Apollo, that the
earth brought forth a flower altogether like to a Lilly, saving it was read,
as Ovid writing in the tenth Book of his Metamorphoseos, says.

Ecce cruor, qui fusus humo signauerat herbas,
Desinit esse cruor, Tyrioque nitentior ostro
Flos oritur, formamque capit quam Lilia: si non,
Purpureus color his, argenteus esset in illis.
And for a perpetual memory of the Boy Hyacinthus, Apollo named these flowers
Hyacinthes.

The Nature and Virtues.
The nature and virtues of the red Lillies are yet unknown, because they are
not used in medicine.

Of the wild Lyllie. Chap. xliiij.
The Description.
THe wild Lilly has a straight round stem set full of long leaves, at the
top whereof there grow fair pleasant flowers, in proportion much like to the
Lilly, divided into six small, thick, and flesshie leaves, bending or
turning backwardes almost like a ring, of an old purple or dim incarnate
color, poudered or dashte with small spots, and without any special smell.
The root is like to the common garden Lilly, saving it is smaller and yellow
as gold.

The Place.
This herb grows in some places of Almaigne, as in the woods, and meadows
whose situation or standing is upon Mountains: but in this country they
plant them in gardens.

The Time.
The wild Lilly flowreth in May and June.

The Names.
This flower is called of some in Greek (...): in Latin, Lilium syluestre:
and in some places Affodillus, amongst the Apothecaries, and is used for the
right Asphodelus (but very erroniously: in English, Wild Lilly: in French,
Lis sauuage: the Italians call it Martagon. and the Spaniardes, Amarillis: in
high Douche, Goldwurtz, and Heydnischblumen: in base Almaigne, Lelikens van
Caluarien, Heydens bloeme, and Wild Lelien: some take it for (...),
Hemerocallis, howebeit the flower is not yellow.

The Nature and Virtues.
The wild Lilly also is not used in medicine, and therefore his nature and
virtues are as yet hidden, and unknown.

Lilium syluestre Martagon Italorsi. Amaryllis Hispanorum.


Of Dogs tooth. Chap. xlv.
The Description.
THis low base herb, has for the most part but two leaves, speckled with
great read spots, betwixt which there springs up a little tender stalk or
stem with one flower at the top hanging downward, which has certain
small leaves growing together like an arche or vaute, and like the wild
Lilly, of color white or pale purple, like to a Carnation or flesh color:
out of the midst of this flower, there hang also six small thrommes, or
short threads, with little titles or pointed notes, like as in the Lillies. After
the flower there follows a round knop or little head, in which the sede is
contained. The root is long and slenderlyke to a Chebol, with certain hearie
threddes, or stringes hanging at it.

The Place.
It grows in diverse places of Italy, but chiefly on the hills and
mountains of Bononia and Mutinens, and the Country theraboutes: it grows
not in Brabant saving in ye gardens of certain diligent Herboristes.

The Names.
This herb is now called Denticulus canis, and Dens caninus, of some it is
also called Pseudohermodactylus, of others Satyrio^ Erythroniu^, wherwithall
notwithstanding it has no similitude: but it seems to be Ephemeron no^
lethale, of Dioscorides, which is also called (...), that is, Lilium
syluestre: and it may well be called Lilium syluestre: because that the flower
when as it hangs downward toward ye ground, is much like to the Lillies,
and especially the wild Lillies, saving it is ever smaller.

Denticulus canis Ephemeron no^ lethale.


The Nature and Virtues.




Of Lilly non Gulbus. Chap. xlvi.
The Kinds.
There be two sorts of this Lilly, whereof one has a yellowe flower, the
other a dark Crimsin or purple flower.

The Description.




The Place.
These Lillies are strange in this Country and Flaunders, and are not found
saving in gardens, whereas they grow easily, and prosper well.

Lilium non Bulbosum. Lilly non bulbus.


The Time.
They flower, with the other Lillies, and somewhat after, and sometimes they
flower again in Autumn when the whether is mild and pleasant.

The Names.
The Latinistes do call this kind of Lillies, Lilium non bulbosum. And it
seems to be that kind of Lilly which the Grecians call (...), Hemerocallis:
for as Atheneus writes, it is called Hemerocallis only, because it lasts but
a day. Moreover Hemerocallis is called (...), in Latin, Lilium syluestre, and
Lilium marinum, which names are most agreeable unto these kinds of Lillies.

The Nature and Virtues.


Of the Lilly of Alexandria. Chap. xlvij.
The Description.
THe leaves of this kind of Lilly are long and narrow, amongst which rises
up a little smooth, tender stalk, at the top whereof there grow diverse fair
and pleasant flowers, of a shining white color, and proportioned like to a
little Lilly, in the middle whereof, over and above certain small threddy
stalks or thrommes, there comes forth one somewhat greater then the rest,
like to an aglet, or tria^gled husk, in which after the falling of, of the
flowers the seed grows. The root is round after the manner of Bulbus and
somewhat great, and white of color: dividing it self easily into diverse other
roots.

The Place.
This is also a stranger with us. And it seems that it was first brought from
Alexandria into Italy and these regio^s or Countries.

The Names.
This Lilly is called Lilium Alexandrinum: but of Dioscorides in Greek (...):
in Latin, Ornithogalum: and because there is yet another Ornithogalum,
described in the fifth part of this work, this is therefore called
Ornithogalum maius.

Ornithogalum maius.


The Nature and Virtues.


Of the Hyacinthes. Chap. xlviij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Hyacinthes, yet over and above diverse others which are
also counted Hyacinthes, whereof we will write in the next Chapter.

The Description.
THE first Hyacinthes which are common in the lower Germany, have long narrow
leaves: amongst which spring up smooth stalks, which being laden little flowers
from the middle even up to the very top, are with the weight and burden of the
same, made crooked, or forced to fall, bend, or stoop. The little flowers are
long and holowe, and afterward somewhat spread abroad like unto Lilly
Conuall, not so strong in smell, but yet pleasant and sweet, of color most
commonly blew like azure, and sometimes purple, and sometimes as white as
snow, gray, or ash colored: when these flowers are fallen, there follow
triangled husks or coddes, wherein the small round seed is contained.

Hyacinthus vulgaris etc.


Hyacinthus Orientalis etc.




The Place.
The common Hyacinthes do grow about the borders of fallowed feeldes and
pastures in sandy or gravely ground, and are found in many places, especially
about Wincaunton, Storton, and Mier, in yt West parts of England, etc.

The Time.




The Names.
These are called in Greek (...): in Latin, Hyacinthi, and as some think,
Vaccinia: in English also Hyacinthe or Crowtoes: but these be not those
Hyacinthes wherein the notes or mourning marks are printed: for they are in
the red purple Lillies, as before is said.

The Nature.
The root of Hyacinthe is dry in the first degree, and cold in the second:
but the seed is dry in the third degree, Yet temperate twixt heat and cold.

The Virtues.




Of other sorts of Hyacinthes. Chap. xlix.
The Kinds.
BYsydes the two sorts of Hyacinthes (which in deed are the right
Hyacinthes) described in the former Chapter: there be also diverse flowers,
which are also taken for Hyacinthes and are now reckned amongst them.

Hyacinthus neotericorum primus.


Hyacinthus neotericorum tertius.


The Description.
THE first of these kinds of Hyacinthes, has long, narrow, green leaves:
amongst which are slender stalks, longer then a hand breadth, bearing many
trim flowers, growing together, about the top of the stalk in a cluster or
bundel like to a nosegay or little bunche of grapes, especially before the
opening or spreading abroad of the flowers. The root is round after the order
of Bulbus or Onyons, and does quickly increase acd multiply diverse others. The
flowers are not much unlike to Lilly conual, most commonly of an azure or
sky color, whereof some are more shining and clear, and some are of a deeper
color: sometimes they be also white, and sometimes ye shall see of them
changing toward a carnation or flesh color: whereof the white are of a very
sweet and pleasant savor.



flowers, growing so thick about the top: that they show like a brush or
holywater sprinckle, at the first of a fair violet color, but when they
begin to wither, of a decayed or old worn color, and sometimes but very
seldom white. Finally the round and bulbus root of this kind of Hyacinthe is
greater, and of color somewhat red or purple without.

Hyacinthus Autumnalis, is the least of these Hyacinthes, yea it is less then
the first: it has little, narrow, small, and tender leaves: and small slender
stemmes of half a span long, at the which grow very small flowers, of a
clear azure or sky color, and fashioned, when they are open, like little
stars, with certain fine, small, and short threddes growing in the midst
of them. The seed is enclosed in a small triangled husk. The root is small,
yet of the fashion of an Onyon or Bulbus.



The Place.

The Names.
Bulbi esculenti. Hyacinthus Fuchsij bifolius.
Hyacinthus Fuchsij trifolius.
In these days some call them Hyacinthi Botryodes, or Hyacinthi racemosi: of
the Italians (the white kind especially) is called, Dipcadi, or Tipcadi.

Honds Knoblauch: in English, Dogs Leekes, and bushe or tufte Hyacinthe.

Hyacinthus Autumnalis: in English, Autumn Hyacinthe.



The Nature and Virtues.
These bastard Hyacinthes are not used in medicine, and therefore of their
nature and virtues is nothing written. They are planted in gardens only for
their flowers.

Of Narcissus. Chap. l.
The Kinds.
FIrst of all there are two very fair and beautiful kinds of Narcissus, one
with a Crimsin or red purple circle in the middle of the flower, the other
having a yellow circle, or as it were a Crownet or cup in the middle of the
flower.

The Description.
THe first Narcissus has small narrow leaves like Leeke blades: with a
crested bare naked stalk without leaves, of a foot or niene inches Narcissus
medio purpureus. Narcissus with the purple edged circle in the middle.
Narcissus medio luteus primus. Narcissus with the yellowe garlande or crownet
in the middle.
long, with a flower at the top, growing out of a certain fylme, as it were a
skin, most commonly growing single or alone, and sometimes two together,
meetely large and sweet, made and fashioned of six little white leaves growing
together (almost like a Primerose) in the middle whereof is a certain round
wrinckled little hoope, or cup, bordered or edged about the brinkes, with a
certain round edge, within which are certain small threddes, or stemmes, with
yellowish tipppes hanging upon them: after the flower there appear angled
husks, wherein grows the sede which is black. The root is round and
bulbus, like an Onyon.





And also another sort, which bears double flowers.



The Place.
The two first kinds grow plentifully in diverse places of France, as
Burgundy, and Languedoc, in meadows: but in this Country they grow not at al
saving in gardens, whereas they are so wen or planted.

The Time.
All the Narcissus for the most part do flower in April, saving one of the
first kinds is somewhat rather, and there is another which flowreth not until
the beginning of May.

These pleasant flowers are called in Greek (...): and in Latin, Narcissus,
of some as witnesses Dioscorides (...), Bulbus vomitorius, and Anydros:
unknown in shoppes: in English, Narcissus, white Daffodill, and Primerose
pierelesse: in high Douch, of some, Narcissen Roszlin: in base Almaigne
Narcissen, and Spaensche Iennettekens.

The cause of the Name.
These flowers took their name of the noble youth Narcissus, who being often
required and much desired of many brave Ladies, because of his passing beauty
he regarded them not: wherefore being desirous to be delivered from their
importunate suits and requests, he went a hunting, and being thirsty came to
a fountain, in which when he would have dronken saw his own favor and
passing beauty, the which before that time he had never seen, and thinking
it had been one of the amorus Ladies that loved him, he was so rapt with the
love of him self, that he desired to kiss and embrace him self, and when he
cold not take hold of his own shadow or figure, he dyed at last by extreme
force of love. In whose honor and perpetual remembrance, the earth (as the
Poets feign) brought forth this delectable, and sweet smelling flower.

The Nature and Virtues.
This root eaten provoke vomit, as the root of Narcissus does, whereunto
in nature it is very like: and therefore, as Dioscorides writes, it cures the
diseases of the bladder.

Of bastard Narcissus. Chap. liij.
The Description.
THis flower has long narrow leaves much like unto Leeke blades, but not so
long: amongst which springs up a round stalk bearing a fair yellowe flower
divided into six leaves like the flower of Narcissus, with a long round little
bell in the middle iagde about the edges, and of a deeper yellowe then the rest

The Place.
These kinds of Violets do grow in shadowy places, and low wooddes standing
near unto waters in Italy and Germany, they grow not in this Country, but
in certain gardens.

The Time.
They begin to spring in February, and yield their seed in April, and in
May the stalk with his leaves does vanish clean away, but the root remains
in the ground like to yellowe Crow belles or bastard Narcissus.

But the third kind flowreth not with the other twain, but long after in
April.

The Names.
These pleasant flowers are now accounted for a kind of violettes, which
Theophraste calls in Greek (...), that is to say in Latin, Viola alba

SAffron has long narrow blades like grass, the flowers grow upon naked
stemmes and are of a watches or pale blewe color, divided into six small
leaves (but somewhat long) from out of the middle whereof hang down the
Saffron blades or threddes of a redd color. The root is round like an Onyon,
having sometimes four or five small roots adjoining.

The Place.
Saffron, as Dioscorides and other the Auncientes have written, grows in the
mount Coricus of Cilicia, and that was esteemed for the best, and in the mount
Olympe of Lycia, near about Aegis a town of Aetolia: it grows now in
sundry places of Douchland, especially about Vienne in Austriche, the which
now is counted for the best: it grows plentifully also in some places of
England and Irelande.

The Time.
Saffron flowreth (before his leaves are sprung out of the ground) in
September: and after that it brings forth his grassie leaves, which do last
until May: but in summer a man shall not find neither leaves nor flowers.
The root only remains alive, growing under ground, and bringing forth
other small roots.

Crocus.


The Names.
Saffro^ is called in Greek (...): in latin, Crocus, of some (as witnesses
Dioscorides) Castor, Cynomorphos, or Herculis sanguis: in ye Arabia^ spech
Zahafara^, from thence it was called in French and high Douch Saffran: in base
Almaigne Sofferaen: and in English Saffron.

The cause of the Name.
Saffron was named Crocus, after the name of a certain Damsel called Crocus,
(as Ovid writes) from whence Galen borrowed this History, who recites the
same In nono de medicamentis secundum loca, whereas it is written in this sort.
A young wenche called Crocus, went forth into the fields with Mercury to throw
the sledge, and whiles she took no heed, she was unawares stricken in the head
by Mercury, and grievously hurt, of which hurt she died incontinent: than
of her blood so shed upon the ground, the Saffron sprang up.

The Temperament.
Saffron is hoate in the second degree, and dry in the first.

The Virtues.












Of Standelworte / or Standergrasse. Chap. lvi.
The Kinds.
THere are diverse sorts of Standergrasse called in Greek Orchis, and in Douch
Standelcruyt, whereof there were but two sorts described of the old and
Ancient writers: but we have joined to them certain other, not known nor
described of any other that have traueled before us in the searching out (or
knowledge) of herbs: so that now we have thought good to comprehend them all
in five kinds. Whereof the first is Cynosorchin, sieve canis testiculum: The
second is Testiculum Morionis: the third is Tragorchin: the fourth is Orchin
Serapian: the fifth is Testiculum odoratum, or Testiculum pumilionem.

The first Kind.
THere be five sorts of the first kind of Orchios, which the Greeks call
Cynosorchin.

small hearie things growing about them) are round like to a pair of stones,
or a couple of Olive berries, one hanging somewhat shorter than the other,
whereof the highmost is the smaller, fuller, and harder: and the nethermost is
the greatest, the lightest, and most wrinckled or shriueled.



Cynosorchios prima species. The first kind of Standergrasse, or Dogs
Cullion.


Cynosorchios tertia species. The third kind of Dogs Cullion.








The second Kind.
THe second kind of Orchios, called Testiculus Morionis, is of two sorts
Male and Female.

Testiculus Morionis mas. Fools Cullion the male kind.


Testiculus Morionis foemina. Fools Cullion the female.








Testiculus morionis mas alter. Another fools cullion of ye male kind.


Testiculi morionis feminae species. A kind of female, fools Cullion.




The third Kind.
THe third kind of Orchios, called in Latin Hirci testiculus, and
Tragorchis, his leaves are like to the first leaves of the Lilly, saving they
be smaller, but yet they be larger than any of the leaves of the other Orchios.
The stalk is of a foot long, and oftentimes wrapped about allow with some
leaves: upon the said stalk or stem grows a great many of small flowers
together in a spikie tuffte or bushe, of a very strong fasshion or making, much
like to a Lezarde, because of the twisted or wrythen tails, and speckled
heads. Every one of the said flowers alone, is at the first, as it were a
small round close husk, of the bigness or quantity of a Pease: and when it
opens, there grows out of it a little long and slender tail, the which is
white above where as it is fastened to the stalk, and speckled with read
speckes, having upon each side a small thing adjoined to it, like to a little
leg or foot: the residue of the Tragorchis.
said tail is twisted about, and hangs downewarde. The flower is of a rank
stinking savor, like to the smell of a Goat, and provoke headache, if it be
much and often smelled unto. The roots are like a couple of Nutmegges, or a
pair of stones.

The fourth Kind.
THe fourth kind of Orchios called Scrapias, is of three sorts, one having a
flower somewhat like a Butterfly: an other has in his flower a certain
figure of a Dorre, or Drone Be: the third has in it the proportion of a
certain fly.







Orchis Serapias primus.


Orchis Serapias alter.


The fifth Kind.
THe fifth kind of Orchis is the least of all, and commonly it has not above
three small leaves with veins somewhat like Plantayne, but no bigger than field
Sorrel, or the small leaves of the common Daysies. The stalk is small and
slender of a span long, about which grow little white flowers, of a sweet
savor almost like to Lyllie Conuall, placed in a certain order and winding
about the stalk like to a kind of Hatbande, or the rolling of a Cable Rope:
the root is like to a pair of Stones, or small long kernelles, whereof one is
hard and firm, the other is light and Fungus, or spungie.

The Place.
The Sta^delwurts, or Sta^dergrasse, do grow most commonly in moist places, and
marisshes, woods, and meadows: and some delight to grow in fat clay grounds
(as the kind which is called Tragorchis) which lightly grows in very good
ground: some grow in barren ground. But the sweet Orchis, or Lady traces are
most commonly to be found, in high, untilled, and dry places, as upon hills
and Downs.

The Time.
These herbs do all flower in May and June, saving the small sweet Orchis,
which floureth last of al in August and September.

Priests pintle, and Ragwurtz: in base Almaigne Ragwortel: some also call it in
Greek (...), Triorchis, that is to say, three Ballocks, or three Stones,
wherefore Fuchsius feyned Serapias Orchis to have three Stones, or three Bulbus
roots, yet Pliny attributes unto it but twain. We may call it in English
properly fly Orchis, because all the kinds of Serapias Orchis, have in all
their flowers the proportion and likeness of one kind of fly or other.

Quendel, and in Brabant Onser vrouwen bedstroo, and in some places wilden
Thymus. Many judge it to be that which the Greeks do call (...), the Latins

Saxifranga, than Serpyllum.

Serpillum vulgar.

French Mariolaine: in high Douch Maioran, or Meyran: in base Almayne
Mariolcine, and Mageleyne. It is taken for the right (...) of the Greeks, and
Amaracus and Maiorana in Latin: howbeit it trayleth not along the ground at
all, as Dioscorides writes that Sampsicon should do: wherefore it should
rather be somewhat like that herb which the Gretians call (...), and the
Latins Marum, for this is an herb of a most sweet and pleasant smell,
bearing his flower almost like to Origanum Heracleoticum, which thing
Dioscorides attributes unto Marum.

The Nature.
Marierom is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.
drop, after drop, and that with great difficulty, and it is good for them
that are tormented with the gryping pains, and wringings of the belly.











Marum of the Gretians, then is it also a very good herb (as Galen says) and
fit to be put into all medicines, and compositions made against poison: it is
also good to be mengled with all odoriferous and sweet ointments, as the
ointment called Vnguentum Amaricinum, and such like.

Clinopodium.


The Names.
This herb is taken of some Herboristes for Marum, (that is the English and
French Mastic,) but seeing that it floureth not like Organe or wild Marierom, it
seems unto me to be nothing like Marum, but rather to be like unto the herb
which they call in Greek (...): in Latin also Clynopodium, for the which we
have described it: Turner calls Clinopodium, for the which we have described
it: Turner calls Clinopodium, Horse time, and so does Cooper English
Clinopodium, he calls it also Puliall mountain.

The Nature.
It is in complexion very much like Marierom.

The Virtues.
Clinopodium in wine, and the Decoction or juice thereof made in wine, against
Crampes, burstings, difficulty of urine, and the bitings of Serpents.

These herbs be called in Greek (...), in Latin Origana.

Origanum heracleoticum, and of some Cunila: here in Shoppes it is called
Origanum Hispanicum, because they bring it dry from Spain to sell at Antwerpe,
and this is the cause that the Brabanders call it Origano as the Spaniards do
call it Oreganos

Origanum onitis, which is yet unknown in this country.

Origanum syluestre, that is to say, wild Origan: in Spanish Oregano campestre.

Origanum, and is called in English wild Origan, and Bastard Marierom: in

smell of Marierom, so as in deed their sent is so strong, that they cause
Headache, when they are to much or to long smelde upon.

The wild Basil has square hearie ste^mes, beset with small leaves, much
like to the leaves of Bushe (or small) Basil, but a great deal smaller and
hearie. The flowers are purple or of a sky color very like the flowers of
garden Basil. The root is full of hearie threedes, and creeps along the
ground, and springs up yearly a new, the which the other two garden Basils
does not, but must be new sown yearly.

Acinus: in French Basilic saunage: in high Douch wild Basilgen: in base
Almaigne wild Basilicom.

The Nature.




The Virtues.
Galen says that for his superfluous moisture, it is not good to be taken into
the body. Dioscorides says that the same eaten is hurtful to the sight, and
ingendreth windiness and does not lightly digest. Pliny writes that the same
eaten is very good and convenient for the stomach, and that if it be dronken
with Vinegar it dryueth away ventosities or windiness, stays ye appetite or
desire to vomit, provoke urine, besides this he says, it is good for the
hydropsie, and for them that have the Iaunders.

The later writers say that it does fortefie and strengthen the heart, and the
brain, and that it rejoices and recreateth the spirits, and is good against
Melancholy and sadness, and that if it be taken in wine, it cures an old
cough.

Galen is good to be laid too outwardly, for it does digest and ripe.
Wherefore (as Dioscorides says) the same laid too with Barley meal, oil of
Roses, and Vinegar, is good for hoate swellings.



Acinos.






Of Vaccaria / or Cow Basil. Chap. lxxij.

Nicander, it is called of Valerius Cordus Tamecnemum, we may call it field
Basil, or Cow Basil.

The Nature.
The seed of Ocimastrum is hoate and dry.

The Virtues.
Ocimastrum is good for such as are bitten of Serpents, Vipers, and such other
venomous beasts, if it be dronken with wine.

saving they be longer, and nothing at all read or purple underneath. The seed
grows clustering about the branches, like to the young clusters or blowings of
the grape or vine. The root is tender, and has hearie or threddie strings.

This herb altogether is not much unlike the second kind of Calamynte, saving
it is greater, the stalks be harder, and the leaves be rougher and blacker,
and it creeps not along the ground, but grows up from the earth.



Dioscorides says) unto the whiter wild Mynte. It has square soft stalks
full of joints, and at every joint two leaves standing one against an other,
and it has also betwixt the said leaves and the stalks, little branches. The
leaves be not much unlike to the leaves of Horse Mynte, saving they are
somewhat longer and dented, or natched round about, in proportion like to a

Saluia Romana, Lassulata, and Herba diuae Mariae: in English Cooste Marie, and
of some Balsamynte: in French Coq, or du Coq: in high Douch Frauwenkraut: in

some small Balsamynte: in Italy Herba Giulia: And some take it for (...),
Ageratum of Dioscorides: others take it to be (...), Elichrysum: and others for

Chironium Theophaasti.

These two herbs be hoate and dry in the second degree, as their smell, and
bitter taste does declare.

Douche wild Salbey: in base Almaigne wild Sauie. There are some that think
it to be the second kind of Scordium which Pliny describes, because that

THere be two sorts of Horminum, as Dioscorides writes, the garden and wild
Horminum.

Horminum satiuum. Dubble Clarey.


Horminum syluestre. Oculus Christi.

THe garden Horminum has leaves in a manner round, and somewhat ouerlayde with
a soft Cotton, almost like Horehounde. The stalks be square and hearie of the
height of a foot, bearing all above at the top, five or six fair small
leaves of a bluish purple color: the leaves stand at every ioynte, one
against an other, amongst the which there comes forth little husks, that
bring forth purplish blew flowers. The which when the seed begins to wax
ripe, they turn toward the ground, and hang downewardes, having in them
black seed and somewhat long, the which when it is a little while soked or
steeped in any licour, it waxes clammy or slimie, almost like to the kernelles
of Quinces.

The wild Horminum bears great, broad leaves, gasht, or natched round
about. The stalks also be square, and somewhat hearie, but yet they be longer
and bigger than the stalks of the garden Horminum. The flowers be of a deep
blew color, and do also grow by certain spaces about the stem like to
whorles or Crownettes, out of little husks, which do also turn downewardes
when the seed is ripe, the seed is of a dunne or blackishe color, round, and
also slymie when it is steeped or sooked. The root is of wooddie substance,
and black.

These two herbs have no special savor, especially the garden kind: for
the flowers of the wild kind do savor somewhat like to Clarey.

Tordylion.






Of Daucus. Chap. c.
The Kinds.
MEn do find three sorts of herbs, comprehended under the name of Daucus, as
Dioscorides and all the Ancients do write, whereof the third, is only known
at this day.

The Description.
Daucus is a tender herb, with a stalk of a spanne long, set with leaves a
great deal smaller and tenderer than Fenell leaves. At the top of the stalk
grows little spokie tuffets, with white flowers, like to the tops of
Coriander, yielding a little long rough white seed, of a good savor and a
sharp taste. The root is of the thickness of ones finger, and of a spanne
long.



Daucus, there is now taken, the herb which some do call wild Carrot, other
call it burdes nest: for it has leaves like Coriander, but greater, and not
much unlike the leaves of the yellow Carrot. His flowers be white growing upon
tuffets or rundels, like to the tuffets of ye yellow Carrot, in the middle
whereof there is found a little small flower or twain of a broune read
color, turning toward black. The seed is long and hearie, and sticks or
cleaves fast unto garments. The root is small and hard.

The Place.




The Time.
The third kind of Daucus floureth in July and August.

The Names.
The Daucus is called in greek (...): in Latin Daucum and Daucium.

Daucum Creticum, that is to say, Daucus of Candie.

Daucus, and of some also Daucus Creticus: in English Daucus, and wild Carrot:
in French Carrotte sauuage. in high Douch Vogelnest, that is to say, Birds
nest: in base Almaigne Croonke^s cruyt: and the same is but a certain wild
Carrot.

Dauci tertium genus.


The Nature.
The seed of Daucus is hoate and dry, almost unto the third degree.

The Virtues.










Of Saxifrage. Chap. ci.
The Kinds.
The Saxifrage is of two sorts, great and small.

The Description.
Cronettes or spoky tuffets. The seed is like to common Parselie seed, saving
that it is hoater, and biting upon the tongue. The root is single, white and
long, like the Parselie root, but sharp and hoate in taste like Ginger.

Saxifragia mayor. The great Saxifrage.


Saxifragia minor. The small Saxifrage.






The Place.




The Time.
Saxifrage floureth after June unto the end of August, and from that time
forth the seed is ripe.

The Names.
The Saxifrage is called in Latin and in the Shoppes of this country
Saxifragia, and Saxifraga, of Simon Iannensis Petra findula, of some Bibinella:
in high Douch Bibernell, and Feldmoren: in base Almaigne Beuernaert, and
Beuernelle. There be some also which call it Bipennula, Pimpinella, and
Pampinula, the which is the peculier or proper name of our Burnet described in
the xcv. Chapter of the first book: and does not apperteyne unto these herbs,
as it appears by this old Verse: Pimpinella pilos, Saxifraga non habet
vllos: that is to say, Pimpinell or Burnet has hears but Saxifrage has none.
Whereby it appears that our Pimpinell commonly called in Englinsh Burnet,
(which has certain fine hears appearing in the leaves when they are broken)
was called in times paste in Latin Pimpinella, and this which has no
hearinesse at all was called Saxifragia. Some learned men of our time,
traueling to bring the small Saxifrage under certain Chapiters of Dioscorides
do call it Sison: and others Petroselinum Macedonicum: The third sort would
have it a kind of Daucus. But in my judgment it is much like to Dioscorides
(...), Bunium.

The Nature.
Saxifrage with his leaves, seed and root is hoate and dry even to the third
degree.

The Virtues.


















Of white Saxifrage or Stonebreake. Chap. cij.
The Description.
THe white Saxifrage has round leaves, commonly spread abroad upon the ground
and somewhat iagged about the borders, not much unlike the leaves of ground
Iuie, but softer and smaller, and of a more yellowish grene. The stalk rises
amongst the leaves, and is round and hearie, and of the length Saxifraga alba.
White Saxifrage.
Saxifraga aurea. Golden Saxifrage.
of a foot and half, it carries at the top diverse white flowers, almost
like to stock Gillofers. The root is blackishe with many threddie strings, by
which hangs diverse little round graynes, corns, or berries, of a dark or
reddish purple color, greater than Coriander seed, sharp and bitter, the
which little graynes or berries they use in medicine and do call it Semen
Saxifragae albae, that is to say, the seed of white Saxifrage or Stone break.



The Place.




The Time.




The Names.
Saxifraga alba: in English Stone break, and white Saxifrage: in French
Rompierre, and Saxifrage blanch: in high Douch weisz Steinbrech: in base
Almaigne Wit Steenbreeck.

Saxifraga aurea: in English Golden Saxifrage: in French Rompierre, or
Saxifrage doree: in high Douch Golden Steinbrech: in base Almaigne Gulden
Steenbreek, and this name is given it: because it is like to the white
Saxifrage, and bears yellow or golden flowers.

The Nature.
This herb especially the root with the seed, is of a warm or hoate
complexion.

But the golden Saxifrage is of a cold nature, as the taste does manifestly
declare.

The Virtues.

langue de beufe, and the leaves be a little rougher.

Jerome Bocke has treated in his herball, it grows a span long, with his
stalk set with small narrow leaves, like to the leaves of line or flax,
betwixt the which leaves and the stalk, it brings forth a little smooth,

Of Panax. Chap. cv.
The Kinds.
DIoscorides that famous, and ancient writer of Plants, has described unto
us three sorts of Panaces: whereof the first is Panaces Heraclium: The second
is Panaces Asclepij: The third is Panaces Chironium.

The Description.
Opopanax, the which being fresh and newly drawn forth of the plant is
white: but being dry it waxes all yellowe without, as though it were colored
with Saffron.

(...). Panaces Heracleum.




Dioscorides and others do write, has leaves like unto Marierom, flowers of a
golden color, a small root, not going deep in the ground, and of a sharp
taste. But as Theophrastus, and Plinic do describe it, This third kind of
Panaces should have leaves like unto Patience, or Sorrel, flowers of a golden
color, and a long root, so that amongst the old writers, is no perfect
consent touching this third kind of Panax.

The Description.
Opopanax. And this plant has great large leaves, somewhat rough and hearie,
largely spread abroad, and made of sundry leaves joined together all in one,
whereof each collateral (or by, leaf) is long and large almost like to ye
leaves of Patience: The stalk or stem of this plant is full of joints, and
of five or six foot long, dividing it self again into other stalks and
branches: The flowers be yellow, growing in spokie tuffetes or rundels: The
seed is plain, and the root is long and white.

The Place.
Lybia, and Macedonia: also in Boeotia, and in Phocis of Arcadia, whereas they
use to sow it, and manure it diligently, for the gain that is gotten of the
sap or juice thereof.

Pelius in Thessalie, and loves good ground.

Quarta Panacis Species. The fourth kind of Panax.


The Time.
The Opopanax is drawn, gathered in the time of harvest.

The Names.
Panaces Herculeum, of Galien also Panax: unknown in the shoppes here.

The liquor that comes from it, is called in Greek (...): in Latin also
Opopanax: in shoppes Opopanacum.

Panaces Asclepij, or Aesculapij Panaces.

Panaces Chironium.

Panaces Syriacum, whereof Theophrastus and Pliny have mentioned: which
differs from the former kinds, as we have else where, more largely written in
Latin.

Panaces: in shoppes is called Siler montanum.

The Nature.


The liquor thereof is also of the like temperament.



The Virtues.
Herb Sarrasine, which is Aristolochia Clematitis, it is good against the
poison of all venomous beasts. Being dronken with wine, it cures the
suffocation and strangling, or choking of the Matrix or Mother, and causes the
same to fall and return again to his natural place.











Of Louage. Chap. cvi.
The Kinds.
IF men take that herb which is commonly called in Shoppes Leuisticum, for
one of the sorts of Ligusticum: Then there are two kinds of Ligusticum, the
one which is the right Ligusticum, described by the Auncientes, And the other
which may be a bastard or wild kind of Ligusticum.

The Description.
Ligusticum, described by Dioscorides, is in his root like to the first kind
of Panax: it has slender stalks, with joints like unto Dill. The leaves are
like to the leaves of Melilot, but they be softer and of a better savor,
whereof the uppermost leaves are tenderest, and more iagged or cut. At the top
of the stalks grows the seed in spokie tuffetes, the which is hard and
long, almost like to Fenell seed, of an aromaticall or Spycie savor, and in
taste sharp and biting. The root is white, and odoriferous, much like to the
root of the first kind of Panax. Nevertheless it is not yet known in this
Country.

Ligusticum, has great, large, odoriferous leaves, much iagged and cut,
almost like to the leaves of Angelica: but a great deal larger, fayrer and of
a deeper green color, deeper cut and more cloven. The stalk is smooth,
round, holowe, and ioyntie, of the length of a man or more, with spokie
rundels, or tuffetes, at the top of the stalks: bearing a yellow flower, and a
round, flat, broad, seed: larger then Dyll seed, and smaller then Angelica
seed. The root is long and thick and brings forth yearly new Stemmes.

Ligusticum verum. The right Louage.


Ligusticum vulgar. The common Louage.


The Place.
Ligusticum, grows in Liguria, upon the mount Apennian, near to the Town
or City of Genues, and in other mountains there about.

The second kind is planted in our gardens.

The Time.


The Names.
Ligusticum: and of some also as Dioscorides writes Panaces, by the which name
it is yet known in the Shoppes of Genues: in the Shoppes of Flaunders they
call it Siler Montanum: in English Louage: in French Liuesche: and in Douch
Ligusticum.

Leuisticum, and the Apothecaries use it in steed of the right Ligusticum: in
English Louage: in French Leuesse, or Liuesche: in Douche Liebstockel: in
Brabant Lauetse, and Leuistock.

The Nature.
Ligusticum is hoate and dry in the third degree.

Louage is also hoate and dry, and of quality much like to Ligusticum.

The Virtues.
Ligusticum is very good for all inward diseases, driving away all ventositie,
or windiness, especially the windiness of the stomach, and is good against
the biting of Serpents, and al other venomous beasts.



Ligusticum warmeth the stomach, helps digestion, and is pleasant to the
mouth and taste, wherefore in times past the people of Genues did use it in
their meats instead of Pepper, as some do yet, as witnesses Antonius Musa.





Ligusticum, and it may be used without error, in steed thereof.



Of Angelica. Chap. cvij.
The Kinds.
ANGELICA is of two sorts, that is the garden and wild Angelica.

The Description.
Spondilium, or Douch Branck vrsine, but they be tenderer, longer, greener, and
of a stronger savor. Amongst those leaves springs up the stalk, three
years after the sowing of the seed, the which stalk is thick, and ioyntie,
hollow within, and smells almost like to Petroleum. At the top of the
stalks grows certain little felmes, puffed or bolne up like to small
bladders or bags, out of which comes the spokie tops or rundels almost
like unto the tops of Fenell, bearing white flowers, and afterward great,
broad double seed, much greater then Dill seed, and like to the seed of
the third kind of Sesely. The root is great and thick, black without and
white within, out of which, when it is hurt or cut, there flows a fat or
oily liquor, like gomme, of a strong smell or taste.



The Place.
The tame Angelica is sown and planted in the gardens of this Country.

The wild grows in dark shadowy places, alongest by water sides, and
wooddes standing low.

The Time.
The two kinds of Angelica, do flower in July and August.

Angelica Satiua. Garden Angelica.


Angelica Syluestris. Wild Angelica.


The Names.
This herb is called in English Angelica: in French Angelique: in high Douch
Angelick, des heylighen gheistswurtzel, oder Brustwurtz: in the shoppes of
Brabante Angelica. There is yet none other name known to us.

The Nature.
Angelica especially that of the garden is hoate and dry, almost in the third
degree.

The Virtues.
Angelica are contrary to all poison, the Pestilence, and all naughty
corruption, of evil or infected air.

Scabiosa, Carduus Benedictus, or Rosewater, then they bring him to bed, and
cover him well until he have swet well.



Angelica pound with the leaves of Rue and honey, are very good to be laid
unto the bitinges of mad Dogs, Serpents, and Vipers, if incontinent after
his hurt, he drink of the wine wherein the root or leaves of Angelica have
boiled.

Of Horestrange or Sulphurwort. Chap. cviij.
The Description.
THIS herb has a weak slender stalk, with joints or knottes, the leaves
are greater than the leaves of Fenill, like to the leaves of Pine tree. At the
top of ye stalks grows round spokie tuffetes full of little yellowe
flowers, the which afterward do turn into broad seed. The root is thick
and long, black without, and white within, of a strong grievous smell, and
full of yellow sap or liquer smelling not much unlike to Sulphur, or
Brymstone, and it bears at the highest of the root above the earth a
certain thick or bushe of hear, like to the roots of Libanotides, before
described, amongst which the leaves and stalk do spring up.

The Place.
This herb grows upon the high mountains of Almaigne, and in the woods of
Languedoc, and certain other countries. Hear the Herboristes do sow it in
their their gardens, It is found in certain places of England, and D. Turner
says, he found a root of it at S. Vincentes rock by Bristowe.

Peucedanus.


The Time.
Peucedanum flowreth in July and August.

The Names.
It is called in Greek (...): In Latiue and in shoppes Peucedanum, of some
also (...), id est, Bonus Genius, Pinastellum, Stataria, and Foeniculus
Porcinus: In English also Peucedanum, Horestrong, or Horestrange, Sow fenill,
and of some Sulpherwurt: In Italion Peucedano: In Spanishe Heruatum: In French
Peucedanon, and Queue de Pourceau: In high Douch Harstrang, and of some
Schwebelwurtz, and Sewfenchel, that is to say, Sulpher root, and Sowfenell: In
base Almaigne Verckens Venckell.

The Nature.
This herb, but specially the sap or iuys of the root, is hoate in the
second degree, and dry almost in the beginning of the third degree.

The Virtues.
Peucedanum or Horestrange taken by it self, or with bitter Almondes and Rue
(as Pliny says) is good against the shortness of breath, swageth the griping
pains of the belly, dissolueth and drives away ventositie, windiness, and
blastinges of the stomach and of all inward parts, it wastes the swelling
of the Melte or Spleen, It loses the belly gentilly, and purges by siege
both fleme and choler.



Peucedanum is good against the Cough, if it be taken with areare egg.



Phrenitis, and the old grievous head aches, and giddiness of the same,
terrible dreams, and the falling sickness.



Peucedanum burned upon quick coals, drives away Serpents and all other
venomous beasts creeping upon the ground.













Of great Pellitorie of Spain / Imperatoria or Masterwort. Chap. cix.
The Kinds.
MAsterwort is of two sorts, tame and wild, not much oulyke one another,
as well in leaves as in flowers and roots, and both kinds are well known in
this Country.

The Description.
IMperatoria or Masterwort has great broad leaves, almost like Alerander: but
of deeper green, and stronger savor, every leaf is divided into three
others, ye which again has two or three deep cuttes or gasshes, insomuch as
every leaf is divided into seven, or nine parts, and every part is toothed or
natched round about like a saw. Amongst these leaves grows the tender
knottie stalks, which be of a reddishe color next the ground, bearing at
the top round spokie tuffets with white flowers, after the which comes the
seed, which is large and like to Dyll seed. The root is long of the
thickness of ones finger, creeping along and puts up new leaves in
sondrie places, somewhat black without and white within, hoate or biting upon
the tongue, and of a strong savor.

Imperatoria, commonly called Herb Gerarde, or Aishe Weed, is not much unlike
ye abouesaide in leaves, flowers, and roots, saving that the leaves are
smaller growing upon longer Stemmes, and the root is tenderer whiter and not
so thick. Also the whole plant with his root is not althing so strong in in
savor, yet it is not alto gither without a certain strong smell or savor.

The Place.
Asterantium or Masterwort, is sometimes found in wooddes and deserts upon
littel hills or small mountains. They do also plant it meetely, plentifullye
in the gardins of high and base Almayne, and England.

Imperatoria, or wild Masterwort, grows commonly in most gardens of his own
kind, and this is surely a weed or unprofitable plant. And whereas these
herbs have once taken root, they will there remain willingly, and do yearly
increase and spread abroad, getting more ground daily. For which cause as I
think it was first called Imperatoria or Masterwoortz in Douch.

Asterantium, Ostrutium.


The Time.
These herbs do flower here in June and July.

The Names.
Osteritium, Ostrition, Ostrutium, or Asterantium: of some Imperatoria: In
English also Imperatoria Masterworte, and Pellitorie of Spain: In Italion
Imperatoria: In French Ostrutium, or Imperatoire, and Herb du Benioin, but
falsely: In high Douch Meysterwurtz: In base Almaigne Meesterwortell.

Imperatoria, is now called Herba Gerardi, (...) and Septifolium, that is to
say, Herb Gerarde, and Setfoyle: In English some call it Aishweede: In base
Almayne Geraert, and Seuenblat.

The Nature.
Asterantium, but chiefly the root is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The wild is almost of the same nature and quality, but not so strong.

The Virtues.


of old fevers, and the Dropsy, and it provoke swet.







Imperatoria, or herb Gerarde, pound and laid upon such members or parts
of the body, as are troubled and vexed with the gowte, swageth the pain, and
takes away the swelling.



Of Ferula. Chap. cx.
The Description.
Ferula are great and large, and spread abroad, and cut into very small
threddes or hears like Fenell, but a great deal bigger: The stalk or stem is
thick, ioyntie, and very long: in the tops of the stalks grows great
round spokie tuffetes, bearing first yellowe flowers, and afterward long,
broad, and black seed, almost as large as the seed of Melones or Pepones.
The root is thick and white, and grows deep in the ground, or in the
joints or cliftes and Choppes of Cleeffes and Rocks.



The Place.
These Ferulas do grow in Greece, and Italy, and other hoate regions, but they
are strange in this Country, and Flaunders.

Ferula.


The Names.
Ferula.

Ferulago, The which of Theophrastus is called in Greek (...).

The Nature.
There is no peculier or special use of these Ferulas, saving that the liquor
or gummes that flows out of them, as Sagapenum, Ammoniacum, and Galbanum, are
used in medicine, wherefore their nature and virtue shall be described in the
Chapters following.

To the Reader.

COnsidering, well-beloved Reader, that we have written in the Chapters going
before of some herbs, out of the which flow very costly sappes or gummes
geathered, dried, and preserved, the which are greatly used in Medicines and
Surgerie, especially as the sap of Panax, the which is called Opopanax, and
the sap of Laserpitium, the which is named Laser, which in far Countries
do flow out of the same herbs, and are brought into this Country, and into
all parts of Christendom, of whose strength and virtue we have not written:
therefore have we in the end of this part for a conclusion and finishing of
the same, written of the nature and virtue of the same gummes. And not only of
the gummes flowing out of the herbs above rehearsed: but also of gummes and
sappes flowing out of herbs or thereof made, the which commonly we find at
the Apothecaries and are used in Medicines, although that the herbs (because
they are not known in Christendom) are not written or spoken of by us,
omitting the sappes and gummes which flow out of wooddes and trees, as Rosin,
Pitche, Turpentine, and such like, we will write of the history of wooddes
and trees. And in the description of these gummes and sappes we will follow the
learning of the Auncientes, as Dioscorides, Galen, Pliny, etc. Declaring their
names as they are called by the said Auncientes in Greek and in Latin, by the
which they are now at this time known to the Apothecaries, like as we have
yet hitherto done and written in the history of herbs.

Of Opopanax. Chap. cxi.
OPopanax is the gum or sap of the first kind of Panaces, called
Heracleoticum, as Dioscorides writes, and it flows out of the root and
stalk of Panaces, as they shall be hurt or cut, and the sap when it is yet
fresh, and first flowen out, is white, and when it is dry, it is altogyther
yellowe like that which is colored with Saffron. And the best of this sap or
gum is that same which on the outsyde is yelowe and within whitish, for that
is yet fresh.

The Names.
The gum is called in Greek (...): in Latin Opopanax: and of the
Apothecaries Opopanacum: in English Opopanax.

The Nature.
Opopanax is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.
Opopanax is very good against the cold shiuerings, and brusing of Agues, the
pain and grief of the side, the gnawing and griping pain of the bowelles or
guts, the Strangurie, and for them that are squatte or bruysed within, by
occasion of falling, if it be dronken with Meade or Honied water. And to be
taken in the same manner or with wine, it cures the inward scuruinesse or
hurt of the bladder.

Opopanax as Mesue writes, taken the weight of two drammes or less, pourgeth
by siege, the phlegm and cold, tough, clammie, and slymie humors, drawing the
same from parts far of, as from the head, the sinews and joints. Moreover
it is very good against al cold diseases, of the brain and sinews, as the
Crampe and Paulsie, etc.





Opopanax does scatter, soften, and resolve, al hard, cold, swelling, or
tumors, being stieped in vinegar, and applied or laid thereto.





Opopanax being laid upon Carbuncles, and Pestilentiall botches, and tumors,
breaks the same, especially after that it has been soked in vinegar, and
mingled with leccayne.

Mesue says, to be boiled in vinegar, and holde^ or kept in the mouth.





Of Laserpitium / and Laser. Chap. cxij.
The Description.
LAserpitium (by that we may gather of Theophrastus and Dioscorides) is an
herb that dies yearly, his stalk is great and thick like Ferula: the leaves
be like Persley and of a pleasant sent: The seed is broad as it were a little
leaf, it has a great many roots growing out of one head, which is thick and
covered with a black skin.

From out of these roots and stalks being scarified and cut, flows a
certain strong liquor, the which they dry, and is very requisite in
medicine, and it is called Laser: but it is not all of a sort, nor in all
places alyke, for it changes in taste, savor, and fashion, according to the
places where as the Laserpitium grows.

Laserpitium growing in Cyrene, is of a pleasant savor, and in taste not very
grievous: so as in times past, men did not only use it in shoppes for Physic,
but also in fine Cakes, Iunkettes, and other meats, as Pliny writes.

Laserpitium, that grows in Media, and Syria, is of a very loathsome, and
stinking savor.

The Place.
Laserpitium grows on the high mountains and deserts of Cyrene and Aphrica,
and this is the best and chiefest, and it yields a liquor which is very good
and of a pleasant smell. It grows also in Syria, Media, Armenia, and Lybia,
but the juice or liquor thereof is not so good, but is of a very loathsome
detestable, and abominable smell.

The Names.
This plant is called in Greek (...): In Latin Laser, and Laserpitium: of
some, as witnesses Dioscorides, Magudaris, especially that which yields no
liquor, as in Lybia.

The stalks of the right Laserpitium are called in Greek (...): and in Latin
Silphium.

The roots are called (...), and Magudaris.

The first leaves yt spring up out of the ground, are called (...), Maspetu^.

The juice or liquor of Laserpitium, is called in Latin Laser: and of the
Arabian Physicians Asa, or Assa.

The juice which flows from the stalks is called of Pliny Caulias, and of
Gaza the interpreter of Theophrastus, Scaparium Laser.

That which flows from the roots, is called Rhizias, of Gaza Radicarium
Laser.

Succus Cyrenaicus, or Laser Cyrenaicum, of some Asa Adorata: unknown in
Shoppes: for that which they take for Laser (as all the learned men of our
time think) is called of the Apothecaries Gummi benzui, or Belzui, or Assa
dulcis: in English Belzoin, or Benzoin: in French Benioin, and it is not
Laser: but the gum or liquor of a certain great tree to us unknown, as the
trauelers do affirm, and as it does manifestly appear by the thick pieces of
bark and wood, which is often found in and amongst the Benzoin, that it cannot
be the gum or liquor of an herb that perishes yearly.

Laser Medicum, or Succus Medicus.

Laser Syriacum.

These two last recited kinds of Laser that come from Syria, and Media,
because of their loathsome savor, are called of the Arabian Physicians and
Apothecaries Assa foetida: in English also Assa fetida: in high Douche Teufels
dreck, that is to say Deuilles dirt: it is called in Brabant by a very strange
name Fierilonfonsa.

The Nature.
Laserpitium, especially the root, is hoate and dry in the third degree.

Laser is also hoate and dry in the third degree, but it exceeds much the
heat of the leaves, stalks, and roots of Laserpitium.

The Virtues.
Laserpitium are very good (as Dioscorides and Galen writes) to be dronken
against alpoyson: and a little of the same eaten with meat, or taken with
salt, causes one to have a good and sweet breath.









phlegm, and it is very profitable against an old cough coming of cold, to
be taken with honey in manner of a Lohoc, or electuarie.

Quartaynes.

















Assa foetida, is good for all purposes aforesaid, howbeit, it is not so good
as the Laser of Cyrene: yet it is very good to smell unto, or to be laid upon
the Navel, against the choking or rising up of the mother.

They use Benzoin in steed of Laser Cyrenaicum, for all the purposes
aforesaid that be attributed unto sweet Laser.

The Choice.
The best Laser is that which is reddish, clear and bright, and sauering like
Myrrh, not greenish, and of a good and pleasant smell, the which being
dissolved waxes white.

Of Sagapenum. Chap. cxiij.
SAgapenum ye is sap or gum of a kind of Ferula or Kix, like unto Panax
growing in Media, altogyther unprofitable, saving for yt gum or liquor that
is drawn out of it. And the best is that, which (as Mesue says) does melt, by
and by, in the water, and sauereth like garlike: or betwixt Laser, and
Galbanum, as Dioscorides says: which is sharp and clear, of a yellowishe
color without, and white within.

The Names.
This gum is called in Greek (...): in Latin Sagapenum, and Sagapeniu^, of
Pliny Sacopenium, of Galen, (...), that is, Sagapeni Succus: They call it in
shoppes Serapinum.

The Nature.
Sagapenum is hoate in the third degree, and dry in the second.

The Virtues.
















the juice of Rue: it is also good against the bloodshoting and dinnesse of the
same, which comes by the occasion of gross humors.

Of Galbanum. Chap. cxiiii.
GAlbanum is also a gum or liquor, drawn forth of a kind of Ferula in
Syria called Metopium. And the best is gristel, or betwixt hard and soft, very
pure, fat, close and firm, without any sticks or splinters of wood amongst
the same, saving a few seeds of Ferula, of a strong savor, not moist, nor to
dry.

The Place.
The plant out of which Galbanum flows, grows upon the mountain Amanus in
Syria.

The Names.
Pliny calls y^ plant out of which Galbanu^ flows, in Latin Stagonitis.

The liquor or gum is called in Greek (...): in Latin and in shoppes
Galbanum: of some also Metopium.

The Nature.
Galbanum is hoate almost in the third degree, and dry almost in the second.

The Virtues.




















Of Ammoniacum. Chap. cxv.
AMmoniacum is the gum or liquor of a kind of Ferula, which is called
Agasyllis, as Dioscorides says, growing in the Country of Cyrene in Aphrica,
nigh to the Oracle of Ammon in Lybia, whereof it is called Ammoniacum, as some
think. The best Ammoniacum, as Dioscorides writes, is that which is close or
firm, pure, and without shardes, splinters, or stony gristels or gravel, and
without any other baggage intermeddled with the same, of a bitter taste, and
drawing toward the savor of Castoreum, and it is almost like the right
Frankenesence, in small pieces and gobbetes.

The Names.
This gum is called in Greek after the name of the Temple of Ammon, (...):
in Latin Ammoniacum: in Shoppes Armoniacum, and Gummi Armoniacum.

The best and purest of this gum or liquor, is called Thrausma, as
Dioscorides says, that is to say, Friatura in Latin.

That which is full of earth and gravel, is called Phyrama.

The Nature.
Ammoniacum is hoate in the second degree, and almost dry in the same degree.

The Virtues.








Tophi, which be hard tumoures engendered of the gowte in the joints and
extreme parts: it consumes also all cold tumors and Scirrhus matter being
laid upon: And it is very good to be put into al oyntmentes and playsters that
are made to chafe and warm, to swage pain, to soften and draw.





Of Euphorbium. Chap. xvi.
FVphorbium is the gum or tear of a certain strange plant growing in Lybia
on the mount Athlante, or Athlas, next to the Country of Mauritania, now
called Morisco, or of the Moors. And it was first found out in the time of
Iuba king of Lybia: the leaf of this plant is long and round, almost like to
the fruit of Cucumer, but the ends or corners be sharper, and set about with
many prickles, which are sometimes found in the gum it self: one of those
leaves set in the ground, does increase and multiply diverse. The sap or
liquor that comes forth of the said leaves, burns or scaldeth, and
straightwayesit congeleth and becomes thick, and that is the Euphorbium. The
first Euphorbium is yellowish, clear, brittle, very sharp and burning in the
mouth and throat, fresh and new, not much elder then a year: for this gomme
does soon lose much of his heat and virtue by age, as Galen and Mesue says.

Euphorbium.


The Place.
The Euphorbium described of the Auncientes grows upon the mount Athlas in
the Country of Lybia, bordering upon Mauritania: it grows also in Africa and
Judea, from whence it has been conveyed into certain places of Spain,
France, and Italy, where as it brings forth neither flowers nor fruit.
Pena has seen it growing at Marselles and Monspellier in France, where as he
saw the flowers and tasted of the fruit.

The Time.
It puts up his leaves in the spring time, whereof the first, the second,
and the third, is the stalk or stem, and the rest grow forth as branches,
and when the plant is seven or eight years old, it brings forth yellow
flowers, like in proportion to Balaustia, and in Autumn the fruit is ripe, of
color red and prickley. etc.

The Names.
This gum is called in Greek (...): in Latin Euphorbium: in shoppes
Euforbium: some call it Carduus Indicus, and Ficus Indica, that is to say, the
Thistell, or fig of India, some take it to be Opuntia Plinij: This Euphorbiu^
should seem to be that whereof Solinus has made mention in the xxvii. Chap. of
his History, whereas he says, Proficere ad oculorum claritatem, Et multiplex
sanitatis praesidium fore, ac non mediocriter percellere vim venenorum. It is
also the Euphorbium described by John Leo in his African history.

The cause of the Name.
Iuba king of Lybia, was the first finder out of this herb: and named it after
the name of his Physician, the brother of Musa who was also a Physician to the
Emperor Auguste.

The Nature.
Euphorbium is very hoate and dry almost in the fourth degree.

The Virtues.
Euphorbium prepared in manner as shall be under written, purges and drives
forth by siege (as Mesue says) tough, cold, and flymie flegmes, and draws
unto it, from the sinews and parts a far of, and also purges choler.
Moreover it is very good against the old head ache, the Paulsie, the Crampe,
the weakness that follows after the French pockes, the pain of the sinews
and extreme parts, that are of continuance, and against the Iaunders. It is
also good against the Pestilence, and such like contagious sicknesses, as one
Gentilis writes.

Euphorbium, and twelve times so much Oil, and a little wax, very singular
against all pains and aches of the joints, the Takinges, Lamenesse, Paulsies,
Crampes, and shrinking of sinews, and against all aches, pains, and disorder
of the same, as Galien in his fourth book de Medicamentis secundum genera,
declares more at large, showing how and when the quantity of Euphorbium, is
to be augmented or diminished, which should be to long to recite in this
place.

Euphorbiu^ mingled with Oil of Bay, Bears grease, or Woolfes grease, or such
like, cures the scurffe and scales of the head, and pyldenesse, causing the
hear to renew and grow again, not only upon the head and other bare places,
but it will also cause the bearde to grow that is slack in coming, if it be
anointed therwithal.



Euphorbium mingled with vinegar, and straked upon the place, takes away al
foul, and euilfauoured spots from the body, especially the white scurffe and
scales of the skin.

The Danger.
Euphorbium by reason of his extreme heat, is very hurtful to the liver and
stomach, and all the inward parts, when it is received into the body, for it
chafeth and inflameth the same out of measure.

The correction and preparation thereof.
Euphorbium is corrected many ways: and first ye must annoint it with Oil of
sweet Almondes, after put it into the middle of a Citron, and wrap it, or close
it up in leauened paste, and so bake it, and when the paste is ready, ye may
take the Euphorbium out of it, to use in medicine.

Maynardus takes Mastick and gum Dragagante, as much as the Euphorbium
comes to, and mingling them well together, puts it into the middle of an
vnbackte loaf, so letting it bake until the bread be well backte: then takes
he of the crumbe or pulpe of that loaf, and makes small pills thereof,
which be very singular against the weakness or debilitie coming of the
French pockes, and al anguish and pain of the outward parts.

Euphorbium, the like quantity of Masticke, and makes pills with the juice
of Citrons or Orenges, the which are much praised against the Pestilence.

Of Sarcocolla. Chap. cxvij.
SArcocolla is the gum of a certain thornie plant growing in Persia. And the
best is that which is yellowish, bitter in taste and like to the fragmentes or
small pieces of Frankensence: yet Pliny in the xiij. Chap. of the xj. book of
his history prefers the white before the other, and so does he also in the
xxiiij. book, the xiiij. Chap.

The Names.
This gum is called in Greek (...): in Latin and in Shoppes Sarcocolla: in
English Sarcocoll: in French Sarcocolle: in Douche Sarcocolla.

The cause of the Name.
The Greeks called this gum or tear Sarcocolla, because it sodereth and
gleweth together wounds and cuttes of the flesh, even as glewe does join
together timber.

The Temperament or Nature.
Sarcocolla is hoate in the second degree, and dry almost in the same degree,
and it dries without any biting sharpness, as Galen says.

Sarcocolla, as Mesue writes, purges raw and gross fleame, and the tough
flymie humors, that are in the joints and extreme parts: It mundifieth the
brain, the sinews, the breast, and the lunges: and is very good against an
old cough that has continued long, and for such as are flegmatique and
Reumatique, to be taken the quantity of a Dram or somewhat more.



Mesue writes) but the milk must be every day renewed, and the stale or old
milk cast away.

The danger and correction of the same.
They that use it much wax balde: it is slow in operation, and it troubles
them that have Cholerique stomachs: wherefore heed must be taken, that it be
not given to such.

One may augmente and increase his virtue to loose the belly, by putting
thereto some ginger and Cardamome.

Of Aristolochia. Chap. i.
The Kinds.
ARistolochia, as Dioscorides writes, is of three sorts, that is to say long
Aristolochia, round Aristolochia, and the Aristolochia called clematitis.
Whereunto Pliny has added a fourth kind, called Pistolochia, and the later
writers have joined to them a fifth kind, called Sarrasines herb or
Astroloche.

1. Aristolochia longa. Long Aristoloche.


2. Aristolochia rotunda. Round Aristoloche.


The Description.
grow fast by leaves, and are in proportion long and holowe, yet longer by one
side than by another: when they are past, there follows a certain fruit like
unto small pears, saving they be ridged alongest the sides, or crested and
cloven like garlike heads: the which do also chop and cleeue a sunder when the
seed is ripe, and the seed that than appears is triangled, and of blackish
color. The root is half a foot long or more, and as thick as ones thombe
or finger, of a yellowish color like Box, of a sharp bitter taste, and
strong savor.



3. Aristolochia Clematitis. Branched Aristolochia.


4. Pistolochia. Small Aristolochia.


5. Aristolochia Sarracenica. Sarasins Aristolochia.








The Place.








The Time.
The Aristolochias do flower in May and July, and timelier in hoate Countries.

The Names.
They are called in Greek (...): in Latin Aristolochia: in English
Aristologia, and of some Byrthwort, and Hartwort: in Shoppes also Aristolochia.

Aristolochiam longam, because of the fashion of the root: it is also called
(...), Dactilis Melocarpon, and Teuxinon, and Aristolochiam marem: In English
long Aristolochia.

Aristolochia rotunda, and Aristolochia foemina: of some (...), and Malum terr:
in English Aristolochia rotunda, and round Aristologia.

Aristolochia Clematitis: Branched Aristologia.

Pistolochia and Polyrhizon.

Herba Sarracenica: in French Sarrasine: in Douche Zarasijn cruyt: in Shoppes
Aristolochia longa, which is in Douche lange Osterlucey: in English long
Aristolochia, in steed whereof it may be used. We may also name it in English
Sarasines herb, and Sarasines Aristolochia.

The Nature.
The roots of Aristolochia, are all hoate and dry in the extremity of the
second degree.

The Virtues.


the same effect, to be ministered in a Pessarie or mother Suppositorie.







Aristolochia rotunda, does beautify, cleanse, and fasten the teeth, if they be
often frotted or rubde with the powder thereof.





Aristolochia longa, wherefore in all compositio^s one may be used in steed of
the other, without error.

The Choice.




Aristolochia Clematitis has the best savor, wherefore it is best to make
Oyntmentes.

Of Holeworte. Chap. ij.
The Kinds.
HOleworte is of two sorts, the one has a round root, which is not holowe
within: And the root of the other is holowe within: but otherwise they are
like one another, in their stalks, leaves, flowers, and seed.

The Description.
HOleworte has small tender ^talkes of a span long: his leaves be also small
and iagde like Rue or Coriander, of a light green or rather a grayishe color.
At the top of the stalk it bears flowers after the proportion of larkes
spur, but much smaller, and of Carnation or a light read purple color, and
oftentimes white, and growing meetly thick together. After the flowers there
comes certain husks or coddes, in which is the seed, which is round and
black. The root of one of these kinds, is all round, and firm, yellowe
within and covered over with a blackishe pyll or skin. The root of the other
is most commonly long, and grown like a pear, holowe both underneath and
within.

The Place.
These roots grow by old quick set hedges, and bushes in the borders of
feeldes, and in the pendant and hanging of hills and mountains. The smaller
root which is not hollow is found in certain places of Brabant by
Louaigne. The greater which is also holow, grows in Germany: and whereas the
one grows, the other grows not at all, so that ye shall never find ye full
root growing with the holowe root, nor the holowe root growing by the full
root.

The Time.
This herb springs betimes, and brings forth his stalks and leaves in
February, and flowreth in March, and delivers his seed in April, and
afterward the herb fades so, that nothing of him remains saving the root
under ground.

The Names.
The root which is holowe within is called in Germany Holwurtz, that is to
say in English Holowe root, or Holewurt: in French Racine creuse: in Brabant
Hoolwortele: that is to say in Latin Radix caua.

The other which is full, close, and firm, is called in Brabant Boonke^s
Holwortel.

Radix caua mayor. The great Holewurt. Radix caua minor. The small Holewurt.


This root especially that which is holowe, has been of long time used in the
Shoppes of this Country for round Aristolochia, and it is so taken yet of
some ignorant Apothecaries. Some of the learned do think this herb to be the
Pistolochia described of Pliny, Others would have it to be a kind of
fumetorie, caled Capnos Phragmites: and some think it to be (...) Thesium
Theophrasti. Some also think it to be (...) Eriphiam Plinij: and it seems to
be somewhat like Eriphya (that is written with y) because it is found in the
spring time only: and therefore it may be well called (...), that is in Latin
Planta veris.

The Nature.
Holeworte is hoate and dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.




Vnguentum Populion nigrum, or with some other of the same nature, is good to
waste and consume the Hmroydes, or piles, and to swage the pains of the same.

Of Swallowurte or Vincetoxicum. Chap. iij.
The Description
ASclepias is somewhat like the third kind of Aristolochia, in stalks and
leaves, his stalks be smothe, round, and small, about two foot long, with
blackish leaves, not much unlike Iuye leaves, saving they be longer and sharper
poynted. The flowers grow upon small stemmes betwixt the leaves, of a pale or
bleake white color, and sometime eyellowish, and also black, of a certain
strong sweetish savor: after them comes long sharpe-poynted husks or
coddes, the which do open of themselves when they are ripe, and within them is
contained seed, lapped as it were in a certain white wool, the which seed
is reddish and broad, not much unlike the seed of Gentian. The roots be
long and round, as it were small round threddie stringes or laces, enterlaced
one with another, almost like the roots of black Hellebor, or Ox heel, and
of a rank savor.

The Place.
Asclepias grows in rough, high, gravely, and Stony mountains.

The Time.
It flowreth in June, and his seed is ripe in August.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): and in Latin Asclepias, of some it is
called in Greek (...), Hederuncula, and (...), that is, Hederae folium, and
now it is called Hirundinaria, and Vincetoxicu^: in Germany Schwalben
wurtzel: in Brabant Swaluwe wortele: we may call it in English Asclepias,
Vincetoxicu^, and Swallowurt.

Asclepias.


The cause of his first Name.
This herb took his name of the Ancient father Esculapius, which was called
in Greek (...), whom both the Greeks and Gentiles say, that he was the first
that found out Physic, wherefore they honored him as a God.

The Nature.
The roots of Asclepias are hoate and dry, and resist poison.

The Virtues.




Of Periploca. Chap. iiij.
The Kinds.
THere are two sorts of Periploca: whereof one has no surname, the other is
called Periploca repens.

Periploca prior. The first Periploca.


Periploca altera. The second Periploca.


The Description.




Both these herbs (being scarrified or hurt) do give forth a milkie juice, or
liquor, and specially the last: for the juice of the first is oftentimes
yellowish.

The Place.
These plants grow in Syria, and such like hoate regions, they do not
lightly bear their husks in Brabant.

The Names.
They are both called Periplocae: and the second is called Periplocca repens:
both are thought to be (...), Apocynon of Dioscorides, the which is also
called (...), and Brassica Canina, yet there is another Brassica canina, a kind
of wild Mercury.

The Nature and Virtues.
Apocynon is a deadly and hurtful plant not only to man, but also to cattle:
his leaves mixed with meal, and tempered or made into bread, it destroys
Dogs, Wolves, and Foxes, and other such beasts that eat thereof.

Of Asarabacca. Chap. v.
The Description.
ASarabacca has swart green, round, shining leaves, like Iuye, but a great
dealerounder, and tenderer: in and amongst those leaves (next the ground)
grow the flowers upon short stemmes, which be of a fair brown purple
color, and of a good savor somewhat like Nardus, and fashioned like the flower
of a Granat tree, called Balaustia or Cytinus which is the buddes of Balaustia,
and somewhat like the cups or husks of Henbane. The roots be small, long,
and crookedly laid, ouerthwaxt, here and there, with diverse small hearie
stringes, of a pleasant sharp savor and taste biting the tongue.

The Place.
It delights in shadowy places, and rough dry grounds, especially in
thependent or hanging of hills and mountains, in thick dark wooddes, and
commonly under the Haselles (as Cordus says.)

It is always green, and springs anew and floureth in the spring time, and
it floureth again at the end of Summer.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin and in shoppes Asarum: of some
Nardus rustica, and Perpenla, Macer calls it Vulgago: it is called in English
Asarabacca, and folefoote, it may also be called Haselworte: in French
Cabaret: in Germany Haselwurtz: in Brabant Haselwortel, and of some Mansooren.

Asarum.


The Nature.
Asarabacca is hoate and dry in the third degree, especially the root which
is most used in Physic.

The Virtues.












Of Dragons. Chap. vi.
The Kinds.
THere are three sorts of Dragons, as Pliny writes, that is to say, the
great and the small, and a certain third kind growing in waterie places.

1. Dracunculus mayor. The great Dragonwurt.


2. Dracunculus minor. The smaller Dragonwurt.


3. Dracunculus palustris. Water Dragonwurt.


The Description.
THe first kind called the great Dragon or Serpentarie, bears an upright
stalk of a cubit long or more, thick, round, smothe, and speckled with
diverse colors and spots like to an Adder or Snakes skin. The leaves be
great and large, compackt or made of six, seven, or more leaves: whereof each
single leaf is long and like to a Sorrel or Docke leaf, saving they be very
smothe and plain. At the top of the stalk grows a long hoose or husk, like
to the hoose or codde of Aron, or Wake Robin, of a greenish color without, and
of a dark red or purple color within, and so is the clapper or pestill that
grows up within the said husk, the which is long and thick, and sharp
poynted peeked like to a hornet whose fruit by increase waxes so, as it
streatcheth, and at length breaks out of a certain skin or velme, the said
fruit appears like to a bunche or cluster of grapes, first green, and
afterward red as fire, the berries or grapes whereof are full of juice or
liquor, in which is a certain small hard seed. The root of this Dragon is
lasting, thick and white, and grown like to a Bulbus Onyon, covered with a
thin pil, and of the quantity of a pretty apple, and bearded with diverse
little white hears or stringes, and oftentimes there is joining to it, other
small roots, whereby it is multiplied.





4. Dracunculus Matthioli. Matthiolus Dragonwurte.




The Place.






The Time.
They flower in July, and in August the fruit is ripe.

The Names.
Dracunculus mayor, of some Serpentaria, and Colubrina: in Shoppes Serpentaria
mayor: of Serapio Luf. in English Dragons, and Dragons wurte: in French
Serpentaire, or Serpentyne: in Germany Schlangekraut, Drachenwurtz: in Braba^t
Speerwortele, and Drakenwortele.

Dracunculus minor: and of some late writers Arum maculatum: in English small
Dragonwurte, and speckled Aron.

Dracunculus palustris, five aquatilis: in English water Dragon, or Marshe
Dragon: in French Serpentaire d'eau, or aquatique: in high Douche Wasser
Schlangenkraut, wasser Drachenwurtz: in base Almaigne, water Draken wortele.



The Nature.
These herbs, but especially their roots and fruit, are hoate and dry in the
third degree.

The Virtues.


















Of Aron / Calfes foot or Cockowpynt. Chap. vij.
The Description.
COckowpynt has great, large, smoth, shining, sharp poynted leaves, much
larger than Iuy leaves, and spotted with blackish marks of blacks and blew:
amongst them rises a stalk of a spanne long, spotted here and there with
certain purple speckles, and it carries a certain long codde, husk, or hose:
open by one side like the proportion of a haares ear, in the middle of the
said husk, there grows up a certain thing like to a pestel or clapper, of a
dark murry, or wanne purple color: the which after the opening of the velme
of husk does appear, when this is gone, the bunche or cluster of beries also
or grapes, does at length appear, which are green at the first, and
afterward of a clear or shining yellowish red color, like Coral, and full
of juice in each of the said berries, is a small hard seed or twain. The
root is swelling round like to a great O life, or small bulbus Onion, white
and full of Pith or substance, and it is not without certain hearie stringes
by it: with much increase of small young roots or heads.

The Place.
Aron grows vnderhedgis, and cold shadowie places.

Arum.


The Time.
The leaves of Aron do spring forth in March and April: and they perish and
vanishe in June and July, so as nothing remains saving only the stalk and
naked fruit in July, in August and after the fruit waxes ripe.

The Names.
This plant is called in Greek (...): in Latin Arum: in Shoppes Iaron, and
Barba Aron: of some Pes vituli: of the Assyrians Lupha: of the Cyprians
Colocasia: (as amongst the bastardes and counterfeit names) where as it is also
called (...), and (...), Pliny affirms in the xvj. Chapter of his xxiiij.
book, that there is much controversy about Aron and Dragonwortes, and some
affirm it to be the same, and so call it Serpentariam minorem: in English
also it is commonly called Aron, Priests pyntill, Cockowpintell: also Rampe,
and Wake Robyn: in French Pied de veau, and Vit de Prestre: in Italian Gigaro:
in Spanishe Yaro: in Germany Pfaffen pint, and Teutschen iugbeer: in Brabant
Papecullekens, and Calfsvoet.

The Nature.
Aron is of complexion hoate and dry, and as Galen says, it is hoater in one
region than in an other, for that which grows in Italy, is only hoate in the
first degree, or almost in the second degree, but that which grows in this
Country, is hoate in the third degree.

The Vertnes.


Of Arisarom. Chap. viij.
The Kinds.
THere is now found two kinds of Arisarom, whereof one has broad leaves,
and the other narrow.

Arisarum latifolium. Broadleaued Arisaron.


Arisarum angustifolium. Narrowleaued Arisaron.


The Description.
THE first and right Arisarom, has leaves fashioned like Aron, saving they be
much smaller sharpepoynted and somewhat fashioned like Iuyleaues, his stalk is
small and slender, his huskie covering, is but little, and his pestill or clapper
small: of a blackishe purple color, his grape or berie when it is ripe is red.
The kernelles are small. The root is also white and fashioned like Aron, saving
it is smaller.

The second Arisaron has five or six, or mo: long, narrow, smothe, and
shining leaves, his huskie bag or hose is long and narrow, the long tail or
slender pestill that grows out of the said husk, is somewhat bigger than a
rushe, and of a blackish purple, and so is part of the lining, or inside of the
husk: to the which at the last there grows, a low even by the ground, and
sometimes deeper, a certain small number of kernelles or berries, growing
together in a little bunche or cluster like grapes: which are green at the
first as the others be and afterward red. The root is also round and white
like the other.

The Place.
Both of these plants are strangers in Germany, and this Country. But the
first kind grows in Italy, specially in certain places of Tuscane: the
other grows about Rome, and in Dalmatia, as Aloisius Anguillara witnesses.

The Time.
Both of these plants do bear their flowers and seed at such times and
seasons as Aron and Dragons do.

The Names.
The first of these plants is called of Dioscorides (...): in Latin Arisaru^,
we may also call it in English Arisaron: Pliny in his xxiiij. book and xvj.
Chap. calls it (...), saying, there is an Aris growing in Egypt, like unto
Aron, but it is smaller both in leaves and root, and yet the root is as big
as an Olife. But the other Arisaron was unknown of the old writers. Yet, that
it is also a kind of Arisaron, it is manifest as well in the flowers, fruit, and
roots, as also in the qualities.

The Nature.
Arisaron is of a hoater and dryer complexion than Aron, as Galen writes.

The Virtues.


Of Centorie. Chap. ix.
The Kinds.
CEntorie (as Dioscorides writes) is of two sorts, that is to say, the great
and the small, the which in proportion and quantity, are much differing one
from the other.

The Description.


Of this great Centorie there is an other kind, whose leaf is not divided or
iagde into parts, or pieces, but after the manner of a Docke leaf, it is long
and broad, single, and not cut into parts: yet it is nickt and snipt round
about the edges, Saw fashion. The stalk is shorter than the other: The
flowers, seed and root, is like the other.

Centaurium magnum. The great Centorie.
Centaurium minus. The small Centorie.
purple red color, like the rose campine, but smaller: which by day time and
after the Sun rising do open, and do close up again in the evening. There
comes after the flowers little long husks, or sharp poynted coddes,
somewhat like wheat corns, in which is contained a very small seed, The
root is small, hard, and of woody substance, and serves not to any purpose
in medicine.

The Place.


The single, or whole leaued great Centorie grows in Spain, and the roots
being brought to Antwarpe, and hither, do sometime grow being planted in our
gardens.



The Time.




The Names.
Centauriu^ magnum: Theophrastus also calls it Centaurida: in Shoppes it is
wrong named of some Rha Ponticum: for Rha Ponticum is that kind of Rha which
grows in the Country of Pontus, and it is a plant much differing from the
great Centaurie. There be also other names ascribed unto the great Centorie,
which are feigned and counterfayted, as Apuleius writes, whereof some seem to
apparteine to the lesser Ce^torie, as (...), that is in Latin Herculis
sanguis, Vnefera, Fell terrae, Polyhydion (...).

Centaurium paruum, and Centaurium minus: of some Febrifuga, Fell terrae, and
Multiradix: of the Apothecaries Centauria minor: in Italy and Hetruria
Biondella: in Spanish Cintoria: in Germany Tausenguldenkraut: in Brabant
Santorie, and cleyn Santorie: in French Petite Centaure.

The cause of the Name.
Centorie was called in Greek Centaurion, and Chironion, after the name of
Chiron the Centaure, who first of all found out these two herbs, and taught
the^ to Aesculapius, as Apuleius writes. And as some other write they were so
named, because Chiron was cured with these herbs, of a certain wound which
he took (being received as a ghest or stranger in Hercules house or lodging)
by letting fall on his foot, one of Hercules shaftes or arrows, as he was
handling and vewing of the said Hercules weapon and armor.

The Virtues.
























Of Reubarbe / or Rhabarba. Chap. x.
The Kinds.
THere be diverse sorts of Rha, or as it is now called Reubarbe, not so much
differing in proportion, but their diversity is altogyther in the places where
as they are found growing. For one kind of it grows in Pontus, and is called
Rha Ponticum: The second grows in Barbaria, and is therefore called
Rhabarbarum, and it is the common Reubarbe: The third comes from beyond the
Indians, out of the regions of China, and it is that which the Arabians call
Raued Seni.

The Description.
RHA (as it is thought) has great broad leaves, like to the leaves of Tapsus
Barbatus, or white Mollin: or like to the leaves of of Clot Burre: snipt and
dented round about the edges like to a saw, green and smothe above, and white
and fryzed underneath. Amongst them springs up a round straight stalk of a
cubite long, and at the top thereof grows a fair scaly knop or head, the
which when it blows and opens, shows forth a fair purple flower, and
afterward it bears seed, not much unlike the seed of the great Centorie,
saving it is somewhat longer. The root is long, thick, and spungie or open:
and being chewed, it yields a yellowish color like Ocre, or Saffron.

The Place.
Rha grows in the Regions about Bosphorus, and Pontus, by the river Rha, and
in Barbaria, and in the Country of China. We have found here in the gardens of
certain diligent Herboristes that strange plant which is thought of some to
be Rha, or Rhabarbarum.

Rha. Reubarbe.


The Time.
It flowreth in June.

The Names.
This herb, and specially the root, is called in Greek (...): in the Arabian
speech Rheu* and Raued, or Rauet, of Pliny in Latin Rhacoma, and Rhecoma.

Rha Ponticum, or Rheon Po^ticum: of Mesue Raued Turcicum, that is to say, Rha
of Turkey.

Rha Barbarum: of Mesue and the Apothecaries Rheu barbarum.

Chinarum) is called also Rha, or Rheum Seniticum: and Rheum Indicum, and of
the Arabians Raued Seni.

The Nature.
Rha is hoate in the first degree, and dry in the second, and of an astringent
or binding nature.

The Virtues.












The Choice.
THe best Rha, as Mesue writes, is yt which is brought from beyond India, and
grows in ye Country of Chinae, called Raued Seni. The next to that is the
Reubarbe of Barbary, and that which is of the least virtue is the Rha Po^tike.

Of Sowbread. Chap. xi.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Cyclamen, as Dioscorides writes. The one is a low
plant with a round root, and is called Cyclamen Orbiculatum. The other grows
high, and wrappeth it self about shrubbes and plants, and it has no notable
root, and it is called Cyclaminus altera.

The Description.






Cyclaminus orbicularis. Sowbread.


The Place.
Sowbread grows in moist and stony shadowy places, underneath trees, hedges,
and busshes, and in certain wooddes, but not euerywhere. It grows about
Artoys and Vermandoys in France, and in the forest of Arden, and in Brabant.
It is also common in Germany and other Countries. But the third kind is the
dayntiest, and yet not strange in Italy.

The Time.
The kinds of Sowbread do flower in Autumn about September, afterward
springs up the leaves, which are green all the winter. The seed waxes ripe
about summer next following.

The Names.
Cyclaminus, Rapum terrae, Tuber terrae, and Vmbilicus terrae: of Apuleius
Orbicularis, Palalia, Malum terr, Rapum porcinum, and Panis porcinus: in
shoppes Cyclamen, and Arthanita: in English Sowbread: in French Pain de
pourceau: in Italian Pan porcino: in Spanish some call it Mazam de porco: in
Germany Schweinbrot, Erdtapffel, Erdtwurtz, and Seuwbrot: in Brabant Verckens
broot, and Sueghen broot.

Pliny calls the color of this flower in Latin Colossinum, or Colossinus
color.

Cyclaminus altera: of some (...), and we take that to be Vitalba, the which
shall be described hereafter in the xlviij. Chapter of this book.

The Nature.
Sowbread is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.




























The Danger.
In what sort soever this root be taken, it is very dangerous to women with
child: wherefore let the^ take heed, not only how they receive it inwardly,
but also let them be advised in any wise not to apply it outwardly: nor to
carry it about them, nor yet to plant it in their gardens, for it will hinder
them if they do but only go over it.

Of Felwort or Gentian. Chap. xij.
The Description.


Gentiana. Gentian.


Bysides the Gentian aforesaid there are two other sorts of herbs, which are
also at this time taken for Gentian.



and this is that plant the which we call Autumn violettes or Belflowers: and
is described in the xxj. Chap. of the second part of this history.

The Place.
Gentian grows upon high mountains, and in certain Coomes or valleys
amongst fern or brake, as in sundry places of Germany and Burgundy.

The Time.
It flowreth in June, and the seed is ripe in July and August.

The Names.
Gentian is called in Greek (...): in Latin and in Shoppes Gentiana: of
Apuleius Aloe gallica, (...), Narce, (...), Chironion, Basilica, Cyminalis: in
English Felworte: in French Gentiane* in high Douche, Entzian, and
Bitterwurtz: in base Almaigne, Gentiaen. It is also called Gentiane in Italian
and Spanishe.

The cause of the Name.
Gentius king of Illyria was the first founder out of this herb, and the first
that used it in medicine, and therefore it was called Gentian after the said
kings name.

The Nature.
The root of Gentian is hoate and dry in third degree.

The Virtues.












Of Cruciata or Dwarf Gentian and Alisma. Chap. xiij.
The Description.
DWarf Gentian has round stalks of a spanne long or somewhat more, they be
also holowe, and spaced with certain knottie joints, the leaves be long
narrow and thick, and grow also by couples one against another, and falling
somewhat backwardes like the other Gentian, the flowers be blew, long and
holowe within like belles, growing forth of green husks, standing round
together at the top of the stalks and about the stem at certain spaces. The
root is white, round, and long, and pearsed or thrust through in certain
places crossewise, which is ye cause it is called Cruciata, as some say: but it
is rather so called of the fashion of the flowers, as Pena says.

Some men also take the herb Alisma or Saponaria for a kind of Cruciata, it
has round stalks with joints or knottes: it is of a cubite or a foot and a
half long, or more, the leaves be large with veins or ribs, like the leaves
of broad plantayne, saving they be smaller, and most commonly growing by
couples at every joint, and bending or falling backwardes, especially those
which grow next the root. The flowers grow in the top of the stalks, and also
about the upper joints in tuffets, of sweet savor, and color sometimes red as
a rose, and sometimes of a light purple or white color, growing out of long
round husks, and are made of five leaves set together, in the middle whereof
are certain small hearie threddes. The roots be long and thick, and grow or
creep crookedly, by which there hang certain small hearie threddes like to
the roots of Bears foot or Setterworte.

The Place.
It grows in certain gardens of Brabant: and else where it grows by
fluddes, brooks, and rivers, and in moist places that are open against the
Sun. It continues a long time in gardens.

Cruciata. Dwarf Gentian.


Alisma five Saponaria. Sopewort Gentian.


The Time.
They flower in June, July, and August.

The Names.
Cruciata, that is to say, Crossed. Both in form and faculty, it seems to
be a kind of Gentian, and Conrade Gesnere judges it so to be, and therefore
it may be called Gentiana minor, that is to say in English, the small or Dwarf
Ge^tian. For there is another Cruciata, so called because ye leaves are set
together, standing like to a Burgonion Cross, whereof shall be spoken amongst the
kinds of Madder. Some would have it to be called Chiliodynamin: but Polemonia
is called Chiliodynamis of the Cappadotions, as Dioscorides writes, but with
this Polemonia the Dwarf Gentian has no lykelyhode.

Saponariam, because of the clensing or scouring property that is in his
leaves: for when they are bruised, they yield a certain juice which will scour
almost like soope. But Ruellius describes an other Soopeworte. Some call it
Herbam tunicam: yet it is none of the cloue Gillofers, and much less any of
the kinds of Polimonij, which are taken for Sweet Williams or Tolmeyners, as
we have written in the Chap. of Gillofers. It should rather seem to be Alisma
or Damasonium, saving that the stalk for the most part is not single, but most
commonly grows forth into certain branches or divisions: and the roots
should be greater or thicker than the roots of Bear foot: But the leaves are
agreeable with the description of Alisma, and so is the tuft or bundle of
flowers at the top. But the stalk of Alisma is single and slender, and the
roots should be also slender: which declare the diversity betwixt this
Saponaria, and Alisma. Some do also take it for Struthion, but it is nothing
like: we may call it in English Soopewort: some call it Mock Gillofer.

The Nature.
The bitterness of these herbs, does manifestly declare, that they be hoate
and dry, in quality not much unlike Gentian.

The Virtues.








Of Elecampane. Chap. xiiij.
The Description.


Helenium.




The Place.




The Time.
Elecampane flowreth in June and July, the seed is ripe in August. The best
time to gather the root, is at the end of September, when it has lost his
stalks and leaves.

The Names.
This herb is called (...): in Latin Inula, and Enula: in Shoppes Enula
Campana: of some Panaces chironion, or Panaces centaurion: in English
Elecampane, Scabworte, and Horseheele: in French Enula Campana: in Germany
Alantwurtz: in base Almaigne Alantwortel, and Galantwortel: in Italian Enoa,
and Enola: in Spanishe Raiz delalla.

Helenium Aegyptiacum, but yet unknown to men of this time.

The Nature.
Elecampane being yet green, has a superfluous moisture which ought first to
be consumed before it be occupied. But that moisture being dried up, it is
hoate in the third degree, and dry in the second.

The Virtues.










Of Spicknel Mewe / or Meon. Chap. xv.
Matthiolus figure is almost like the first kind of Libanotidis, and as Turner
and he writes, is called in Douche Bearewortes, or Hearts wortes.

The Description.
MEon of Dioscorides is described amongst the roots, wherefore we have none
other knowledge of the fashion of the same, but as our Auncientes have left it
us in writing. This have I said, to the intent that men may know, that those
herbs which the Apothecaries and others do use at this day in Physike, are not
the true Meon, which we should not tell how to know, if that men could not
find the fashion, and nature of the right Meon described.

Meon according to Dioscorides, is like to Dyll in stalks and leaves, but it
is thicker and of the height of two cubits or three foot. The roots are
long, small, well smelling and chafing or heating the tongue, and they are
scattering here and there, some right and some awry.

The Place.
New grows plenteously in in Macedonia and Spain.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Meu^: in shoppes Mew, which do
but only keep ye name, for the true Meon is yet unknown, but the Apothecaries
do use in the steed thereof, a kind of wild Parcelie, the which is described
in the fifth part of our history of plants, and it has no agreement or
likeness with the description of Meon, wherefore it can not be Meon.

The Nature.
The root of Meon is hoate in the third degree, and dry in the second.

The Virtues.








Meum. Meon.


The Danger.
If to much of the root of this herb be dronken, it causes head ache.

Of Peonie. Chap. xvi.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Peonie, as Dioscorides and the Auncientes write, that
is to say, the male and female.

The Description.
Poeonie has thick read stalks of a Cubite long: the leaves be great and
large, made of diverse leaves growing or joined together, not much unlike the
Walnut tree leaf in fashion and greatness: at the highest of the stalk there
grows fair large red flowers, very well like red roses, having also in the
mids yellow threddes or hears. After the falling away of the leaves, there
grows up great coddes or husks three or four together, the which do open
when they be ripe, in the opening whereof there is to be seen, a fair red
colored lining, and a pollished black shining seed, full of white substance.
The roots be white, long, small, and well smelling.





The Place.
The kinds of Peonies are found planted in the gardens of this Country.

The Time.
Peonie flowreth at the beginning of May, and delivers his seed in June.

The Names.
Peonie is called in Greek (...): and in Latin Poeonia: of some (...),
Dulcisida, and Idaeus Dactylus, of Apuleius Aglaophotis, (...), and Herba
casta: in shoppes Pionia: in high Douche Peonien blum, Peonie^ rosen,
Gichtwurtz, Runigzblum, Pfingstrosen: in base Almaigne Pioene, and
Pioenbloemen, and in some places of Flaunders Mastbloemen.

The cause of the Name.
Peonie took his name first of that good old man Paeon, a very ancient
Physician, who first taught the knowledge of of this herb.

Paeonia mas. Male Peonie. Paeonia foemina. Female Peonie.


The Virtues.










Of Valerian / Phu or Setwal. Chap. xvij.
The Kinds.
THere be two fortes of Valerian, the garden and wild: and the wild Valerian
is of two kinds, the great and small: Besides all these there is yet a strange
kind, the which is now called Greek Valerian.

1. Valeriana hortensis. Setwall or garden Valerian.


2. Valeriana syluestris mayor. The greater wild Valerian.


The Description.




always less. The first and neathermost leaves are like the little leaves of
Plantaine, the rest which grow about the stalk, are very much and deeply cut,
very well like to the leaves of wild Valerian, or like the leaves which grow
about the stalks of garden Valerian. The stalks be round with joints, about
the length of a hand. The flowers be like to ye flouers of the aforesaid
kinds. The roots be small, and creeping along ye ground.

The Greekish Valerian has two or three holow stalks, or more: upon ye which
grows spread leaves almost like the leaves of wild Valerian, but longer,
narrower, and more finely cut, like the leaves of the wild Fetch, but
somewhat bigger. The flowers grow thick clustering together at the top of the
stalk of a light Azure or blew color, parted into five little leaves, having in
the middle small white threddes pointed with a little yellow at the tops. The
seed is small growing in round husks. The roots are nothing else like, but
small threads.

The Place.
The garden Valerian and Greek Valerian are sown and planted in gardens. The
other two kinds grow here in moist places, and in watery meadows lying low.

The Time.
The three first kinds of Valerian do flower from May to August. The Greek
Valerian does flower most commonly in June and July.

The Names.
Phu: in Latin Valeriana, and Nardus syluestris, or Nardus rustica: in shoppes
Valeriana domestica, or Valeriana horte^sis, of some in these days Marinella,
Genicularis, and Herba benedicta: in French Valeriane: in high Douche Grosz
Baldrian: in base Almaigne, ta^me or groote Valeria^, and of some S. Ioris
cruyt, or Speercruyt, that is to say, Spearwurte, or Spear herb, because his
first leaves at their first coming up, in making are like to the Iron or head
of a Spear: in English Setwal, or Sydwall.

Valeriana syluestris, Phu syluestre, and Valeriana syluestris mayor: in
French grande Valerian sauuage: in high Douch wild Baldria^, Katzenwurtzel,
Augenwurtz, Wendwurtz, and Dennenmarcke: in base Almaigne, wild Valeriane: in
English the great wild Valerian.

Valeriane syluestris minor, that is to say, the small wild Valerian, and also
Phy paruum, and Valeriana minor.

3. Phu paruum. Valeriana syluestris rainor. The small wild Valerian.


4. Phu Grcu^. Valeriana peregrina. Greekish Valerian.


Phu Grcum, and Valeriana Graeca, that is to say, Greekish, or Greek Valerian,
and it may be well called Valeriana peregrina, or Pseudophu, for this is no
Valerian, but some other strange herb, the which we cannot compare to any of
the herbs described by Dioscorides, except it be the right Auricula muris, for
the which it is taken of some.

The Nature.
The root of Valerian is hoate and dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.




Men do use to give it with great profit in dre^ches, to such as are burste^
wtin.

The two other Valerians be not used in medicine.



Rosesenting Root. Rosesmelling Root.
Of Rosewurte or Rhodia. Chap. xviij.
The Description.
ROsewurte has three or four stalks growing from the root, set full of
thick leaves, like ye leaves of Lyblong or Crassula mayor, but they are more
narrower, and cut or hackt at the top. The root is thick, having many small
hearie threddes, and when it is either bruysed or bursten, it does sent and
savor like the Rose, and of that it took his name.

The Place.
Rosewurt or the root sauering like the Rose, grows in Macedonia and
Hungary: in this Country the Herboristes do plant it in their gardens.

The Time.
It floureth in May, but it bears flower very seldom.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Radix Rhodia, and Radix rosata:
in French Racine sentant les roses: in high Douche Rosenwurtz: in base
Almaigne Rosenwortel: in English Rosewurt or the root sauouring of the Rose.

The Nature.
The root which smells like the rose, especially of that sort which
grows in Macedonia, is hoate in the second degree, and of subtle and fine
parts.

Rhodia radix. Rosewurt.


The Virtues.
The root Rhodia laid to the temples of the forehead with oil of roses,
alayeth head ache.

Of bastard Pelitory or Gartram. Chap. xix.
The Description.
PElitory has leaves much like to fenil, al finely cut or hackt. The flowers
are yellow in ye middle, set round about with little white leaves somewhat blew
under, like ye flowers of Camomil, or like the flowers of the great dasie. The
root is long and straight, sometimes as byg as a finger, hoate and burning the
tongue.

The Place.
This herb is not found growing of him self in this Country, but it is
found planted in the gardens of certain Herhoristes.

The Time.
Pelitory flowreth after May until the end of somer, in which season the seed
is ripe.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Saliuaris: in shops Pyrethru^,
of some also in Greek (...): in French Pyrethre, or Pied d' Alexandre: in high
Douch Bertra^. Albeit mine Author sets forth this herb for Pyrethro, yet
it is not aunswerable unto Dioscorides Pyrethrum, or Saliuarem, wherefore I
think we may well call it bastard Pelitory or Bertram.

Pyrethrum. Bartram.


The Nature.
The root of Pyrethre is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.








Of wild Pelitory. Chap. xx.
The Description.
Wild Pellitory has round brittle branches: the leaves be long and narrow
hackt round about like a Saw, at the highest of the stalk grow flowers like
the flowers of Camomil, yellow in the middle, and set round about with small
white leaves: the root is tender and full of threads: the whole herb is sharp
and biting, almost in taste like Pellitory of Spain, and for yt cause men call
it also wild Pellitory.

The Place.
Wild Pellitory is found about the borders of feeldes, in high meadows and
shadowy places, and sometimes upon mountains and stony places.

The Time.
This Pellitory flowreth from May until September.

The Names.
This herb is now called in Latin Pyrethrum syluestre, that is to say, Wild
Pellitory: in French Pyrethre sauuage: in Douche Wilden Bertram: of some Weisz
Reinfahrn, that is to say, White Tansie. This is not (...), Ptarmice, or
Sternumentaria, but another herb unknown of the Incientes.

The Nature.
This herb is hoate and dry.

The Virtues.




Pyrethrum syluestre. Wild Pellitory.


Of false Dictam. Chap. xxi.
The Description.
THis herb is like to Lentiscus, or Lycoras in branches and leaves, it bears
round blackish and rough stalks, and leaves displayed and spread like
Lycoras, at the top of the stalks grow fair flowers, somewhat turning
toward blew, the which on the upper part, or healf-deale has four or five
leaves, and in the lower, or nether of the same flower it has small long
threddes crooking and hanging down almost like a bearde. The flowers perished,
there comes in the place of each flower four or five coddes, something rough
without, and slymie to be handled, and of a strong savor almost smelling like
a Goat: in the which is contained a black, plain, shining seed. The roots
be long and white, sometime as thick as a finger, and do grow a thwart one
another.

The Place.
It grows in the I Will of Candie, as Dioscorides writes, in this Country it
is found in the gardens of certain Herboristes.

The Time.
It flowreth in this Country in June and July, and sometimes the seed comes
to rypenesse.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Tragium: and is the first kind
or Tragium described by Dioscorides. Some herboristes call it Fraxinella: and
some Apothecaries do use the root of it in steed of Dyctam, and do call it
Dyptamum, not without great error, and therefore it is called of some
Pseudodictamum nothum, that is to say, Bastard or false Dictam.

The Nature.
Tragium is almost hoate in the third degree, and of subtle parts.

The Virtues.






Dyctam. And it is possible, that for the same cause this herb was first taken
in shoppes in steed of the right Dyctam.

Tragium.


Of Polemonium. Chap. xxij^.
The Description.




The Polemonium whereof Absyrtus speaks, is the Horse minte described in the
second book.

Polemonium. Been album.


Polemonij altera species.


The Place.
Both these kinds grow upon mountains in rough stony places: men plant them
here in gardens.

The Time.
These herbs do flower in June and July.

The Names.
Polemonium, and Polemonia, of some, (...), Chiliodynamis, yt is to say, a
hundred virtues, or properties: in shops, as witnesses Bernardus of Gondonio,
Herba tunica: of Herboristes at this day Behen, or Been album. Yet
notwithstanding this is not that kind of Behen, whereof Serapio writes in his
CCxxiij. Chapter.

Polemonium, and is called of Herboristes Behen rubrum, this herb should seem
to be Narcissus whereof Virgil in his Georgiques, and Columella in hortis makes
mention.

The Nature.
Polemonium is of complexion dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.










All these last recited virtues from B. to E. are not found in the last Douch
copy. Yet they be all in my French copy, the which I have and is in diverse
places newly corrected and amended by the Author him self.

Of English Galangall. Chap. xxiij.
The Description.






Cyperus. English Gallangal.


The Place.
Cyperus as witnesses Dioscorides, grows in low moist places, and is not
commonly found in this Country, but in the gardens of some Herboristes.

The Time.
This herb brings forth his spikie top, and seed with leaves, in June and
July.

The Names.
It is called in Greek (...): in Latin Cyperus, Cypirus, and Cyperis, of some
Aspalathum, and Erysisceptrum: in shoppes Cyperus: of Cornelius Celsus, Iuncus
quadratus, of Pliny Iunculus angulosus, and Triangularis: in French Souchet
in Douche wylden Galgan: in English Galangal.

The roots called Trasos, are also named of them yt write now Dulcichimu^: in
Spain Auellanada, and of the commons of Italy (as is aforesaid) Trasi, and
Trasci. Some learned men think yt this is (...). Mamiras, whereof Paulus
Aegineta writes, which Auicen calls Memirem, or rather (...), Holoconitis,
of Hippocrates.

The Nature.
The root of Cyperus or English Galangal, is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.












Of white Hellebor or Nesewurte. Chap. xxiiij.
The Description.
THe white Ellebor has great broad leaves, with ribs or sinews like the
leaves of the great Plantayne or Gentian. The stalk is round two or three
foot high, at the vpmost part whereof grows alongest and round about the
top, the flowers one above another, pale of color, divided into six little
leaves, the which have a green line ouerth wart. The same being passed, there
comes in their places small husks wherein is contained the seed, the root is
round, as thick as a man's finger or thombe, white both without and within
having many thick laces or threddy stringes.

The Place.
White Hellebor grows in Anticyra, near about the mountain Deta, and in
Capadocia and Syria, but the best grows in Cyrene. The Herboristes of this
Country do set it in their gardens.

The Time.
White Hellebor flowreth in this Country in June and July.

Veratrum album.


The Names.
This kind of Hellebor is called in Greek (...): in Latin Veratrum album: in
shoppes Helleborus albus: of some Pignatoxaris and Sanguis Herculis: in French
Ellebore blanc: in high Douche Weisz Nieswurtz: in base Almaigne Wit
Nieswortel or wit Niescruyt: in English White Hellebor, Neseworte, and Lingwort.

The Nature.
The root of Ellebor is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.
The root of white Ellebor causes one to vomit up mightily and with great
force, all superfluous, slymie, venomous and naughty humors. Likewise it is
good against the falling sickness, Phrensies, old pain of the head,
madness, sadness, the gowt, and Sciatica, all sorts of dropsies, poison, and
against all cold diseases, that be hard to cure, and such as will not yield
to any medicine. But as concerning the preparation thereof before it be
ministered to any, and also in what sort the body that shall receive it ought to
be prepared, it has been very well and largely described by diverse old
Doctors, whereof I mind not to entreat, because ye rules to be observed be so
long, that they cannot be comprehended in few words, for they may well fill a
book, and because Galen teaches, that one ought not to minister this vehement
and strong root in inward medicines, but only to apply the same outwardly.













The Danger.
White Ellebor unprepared, and taken out of time and place, or to much in
quantity, is very hurtful to the body: for it choketh, and troubles all the
inward parts, draws together and shrinketh all the sinews of man's body, and
in fine it sleaeth the party. Therefore it ought not to be taken unprepared,
neither than without good heed and great aduisement. For such people as be
either to young or to old, or feeble, or spit blood, or be grieved in their
stomachs, whose breasts are straight and narrow, and their necks long,
such feeble people may by no means deal with it, without ieobardie and
danger. Wherefore these landleapers, Roges, and ignorant Asses, which take upon
them without learning and practice, do very evil, for they give it without
discretion to al people, whether they be young or old, strong or feeble, and
sometimes they kill their patientes, or at the least they put them in peril or
great danger of their lives.

Of wild white Ellebor or Nesewurte. Chap. xxv.
The Description.
THis herb is like unto the white Ellebor abouesayd, but in all parts it is
smaller: it has a straight stalk with Sinowey leaves, like the leaves of
Plantaine or white Ellebor, but smaller. The flowers hang down from the stalk
of a white color, holowe in the middle, with small yellowe and incarnate
spots, of a very strange fashion, and when they are gone, there comes up
small seed like sand closed in thick husks. The roots are spread here and
there full of sap, with a thick bark, of a bitter taste.

The Place.
This herb grows in Brabant in certain moist meadows, and dark shadowie
places.

The Time.
This herb flowreth in June and July.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...), because it is like in fashion to White
Hellebor: in Latin Helleborine, and Epipactis: in high Douche Wildt wit
Niescruyt, that is to say, Wild white Ellebor. Some think, that Eleborine is
an herb like to Elleborus only in virtues, and not in fashion. These fellows
will not receive this herb for Helleborine: but by this they may know their
error, because neither Galen nor Dioscorides do attribute any of the
properties of Ellebor to Helleborine.

The Nature.
This herb is of hoate and dry complexion.

The Virtues.


Helleborine,


Of black Hellebor. Chap. xxvi.
Veratrum nigrum Dioscorides. Black Hellebor.


Planta Leonis. Christwort.


The Kinds.
Under the name of Helleborus niger, that is to say, black Ellebor, are
comprehended (by the Herboristes of our time) three sorts of herbs, whereof
ye first is much like in description to Helleborus niger, of Dioscorides: The
second is a strange herb not much differing in virtue from the true black
Hellebor, and is called Christ's herb, and is much like in description to
Helleborus niger, that Theophrastus speaks of: The third is commonly called
of the low Douchmen Viercruyt, that is to say, Fierwurte.

Pseudo helleborus* Bastard Hellebor the black.


Louswurt.


The Description.


four or five cods or husks joining together almost like ye husk of
Columbine wherein is contained the seed. It has in the steed of a root many
thick black stringes.







The Place.






The Time.






The Names.
Veratrum nigru^, and Helleborus niger, of some Melampodium, Praetium,
Polyrhyzon, Melanorhizon, and of some writers now, Luparia, and Pulsatilla: in
high Douch Schwartz, Niesewurtz: in base Almaigne Swert Niesewortel.

Helleborus niger, which Theophrast describes: and is called of learned men
that write now, Planta Leonis, that is to say, Lions foot, and it is taken for
that herb which Alexander Trallian, and Paulus Aegineta call in Greek (...):
in Latin Coronopodiu^, and Pes cornicis. It is called in Brabant
Heylichkerstcruyt, that is to say, the herb of Christ or Christmas herb,
because it flowreth most commonly about Christmas, especially when the winter
is mild.

Pseudo helleborus niger, Veratrum adulterinum nigrum, and it is taken of some
for the herb which Pliny calls Consiligo: in high Douch it is called
Christwurtz, that is to say, Christ's root: in Brabant Viercruyt, that is to
say, Fire herb, because with this herb alone men cure a disease in cattle
named in French Le feu: of some it is called Wranckcruyt, as of the learned
and famous Doctor in his time Spierinck resident at Louaigne: and some call it
Vaencruyt.

The occasion of the Name.
This herb was called Melampodium, because a shepherd called Melampus in
Arcadia cured with this herb the daughters of Proetus, which were distract of
their memories, and become mad: so that afterward the herb was known.

The Nature.
Black Hellebor is hoate and dry in the third degree.

Christeswurt, and the black bastard Hellebor are in complexion; very like to
black Hellebor.

The Virtues.




























The Danger.
Although black Hellebor is not so vehement as the white, yet it can not be
given without danger, and especially to people that have their health, for as
Hippocrates says, Carnes habentibus sanas, Helleborus periculosus, facit enim
Co^uulsionem, that is to say, to such as be whole, Hellebor is very perilous,
for it causes shrinking of sinews: therefore Hellebor may not be ministered,
except in desperate causes, and that to young and strong people, and not at al
times, but in the spring time only: yet ought it not to be given before it be
prepared and corrected.

The correction.
when Hellebor is given with long Pepper, Hysope, Daucus, and Annys seed, it
works better and with less danger: also if it be boiled in the broth of a
Capon, or of any other meat, and then the brothe given to drink, it works
with less danger.

Of herb Aloe. Chap. xxvij.
The Description.
ALoe has very great long leaves, two fingers thick, having round about
short points or Crestes standing wide one from another. The root is thick
and long. The flowers stalk and seed, are much like ye flowers stalk and
seed of Affodyll, as Dioscorides says, but in these parts they have not ben
yet seen. All the herb is of strong savor and bitter taste. And out of this
herb which grows in India is drawn a juice, ye which is dried and is also
named Aloe, and it is carried into all parts of the world for to be used in
medicine.

The Place.
Aloe grows very plenteously in India, and from thence comes the best
juice, it grows also in other places of Asia and Arabia, adjoining to the
sea, but the juice thereof is not commonly found so good. It is to be seen
also in this Country in the gardens of some Herboristes.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): and from thence sprang the Latin name,
and is called Aloe in all other speeches of Christendom, and so is the sap or
juice thereof named. The Frenchmen call it Perroquet: because of his greenesse,
we may call it in English Aloe, herb Aloe, or Sea Aygreene.

The Nature.
The juice of this herb called Aloe, which only is used in medicine, is hoate
almost in the second degree, and dry in the third.

Aloe.


The Virtues.
Aloe which is of a brown color, like to the color of a liver, which is
clear and clean, opens the belly, in purging cold, flegmatike, and
cholerique humors, especially such wherewithal the stomach is burdened, and
is the cheifest of all other purging medicines (which most commonly do hurt the
stomach) but this is a sovereign medicine for the stomach, for it
comfort, cleanses, dries up, and drives forth all superfluous humors, if
it be taken with water the quantity of two drammes.





Aloe made into powder and strawen upon new blooddy wounds, stops the
blood and heals the wound. Likewise laid upon old sores closes them up, and
it is a sovereign medicine for ulcers about the secret parts, and fundement.







Aloe mixed with Oil of roses and vinegar, and laid to the forehead and
temples, swageth headache.

Aloes mingled with wine, it will keep the hear from falling.





Of Palma Christi. Chap. xxviij.
The Description.
PAlma Christi has a great, round, holow stalk, higher then a good long man,
with great broad leaves, parted into seven or nine divisions, larger, and more
cut in, then the leaves of the fig tree, like some birds foot, or like to a
spread hand. At the highest grows a bunche of flowers, clustering together
like grapes, whereof the lowest be yellow, and wither without bearing fruit,
and the highest are red, bringing forth threecornered husks, in which is
found three gray seeds somewhat smaller then kidney Bean.

The Place.
This herb grows not of hit self in this Country, but the Herboristes
plant it in their gardens.

The Time.
It is sown in April, and his seed is ripe in August and September, and as
soon as the cold comes, all the herb perishes.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Ricinus: in Shoppes and of the
Arabians Cherua: of some Cataputia mayor, Peutadactylon, and Palma Christi: in
English Palma Christi: in French Paulme de Christ: in high Douche Wunderbaum,
and Creutzbaum, and of some Zecken korner: in base Almaigne wonderboom,
Cruysboom, and Mollencruyt.

The Nature.
The seed of Palma Christi is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.
Palma Christi taken inwardly, opens the belly, causes one to vomit, and to
cast out slymie phlegm, drawing the same from far, and sometimes cholerique
humors with waterish superfluities.





Oleum Cicinum, in Shoppes Oleum de Cherua. It heateth and dries, and is very
good to annoint and rub all rough hardness, and scuruie roughness, or itche.

Palma Christi pound with parched Barley meal, do mitigate and assuage the
inflammatio^ and swelling soreness of the eyes, and pound with vinegar, they
cure the grievous inflammation, called S. Antonies fire.

Ricinus.


The Danger.
The seed of Palma Christi turns up the stomach, and does his operation
with much pain and grief to the party.

The Remedy.
But if you take with it either Fenill or Annys seed, and some spices of
Cynamome, and Ginger, etc. it will not ouertturne nor torment the stomach, but
will work his effect with more ease and gentleness.

Of the kinds of Tithymale or Spourge. Chap. xxix.
The Kinds.
THere are, as Dioscorides writes, seven sorts of Tithymal: whereof some at
this time are well known, and some shall be now by our endeavor brought again to
light, and some are yet unknown.

The Description.
THe first kind of Tithymal, called ye male kind, has round red stalks, of
the height of a cubite, yt is a foot and a half high. The leaves are long and
narrow, somewhat longer and narrower then the leaves of the Olyue tree, whereof
the highest leaves, before they be thoroughly grown, show rough or cottonlike.
The seed grows at the highest of the stalk in pretty round holow leaves,
like as it were basins, or little disshes, through which the stalk grows. The
seed is enclosed in threecornered husks like the seed of Palma Christi, as
well in growing as in shape or fashion, but much smaller: the root is of a
wooddie substance with many hearie stringes.

Tithymalus Characias. Wood Spourge.


Tithymalus Characiae species.






The flowers are yellowe growing in tuffetes. The root is like the other
Tithymales.

Ezula minor.

Of this sort there is found another kind very small, the which may be well
called Cypres Tithymal. It has very small stalks, both little and tender,
about the heyght of a spanne, and upon them small tuffetes, with flowers of a
faint yellow or pale color, after comes the seed like to the other, but a
great deal smaller.

Tithymalus Myrsinites. Myrtell Spourge.


Tithymalus Paralios. Sea Spourge.


Yet there is a third sort of this kind, whereof the leaves be all white, but
otherwise it is like to Cypres Tithymale, as the great and diligent Herborist
Ian the Vreckom has declared unto us, who before this has had such Tithymale
growing in his garden: nevertheless, I did never see it, and therefore I do
not set out a larger description.



Tithymalus Helioscopius. Wartewort or Son Spourge. Sonturner.


Tithymalis Cyparissias. Cypress Spourge.




All these kinds are full of white liquor or sap like milk, the which
comes forth when they be broken or hurt, and it is sharp and bitter upon
the tongue.

The Place.










But the little of the same kind grows about Malines, in borders of some
fields, yet it is not found every where.



The Time.
All the kinds of Tithymal or Spourge, are most commonly in flower in June and
July, and their seed is ripe in August.

The Names.
All kinds of this herb are called in Greek (...): in Latin Lactariae: in
French Tithymales or Herb a laict: in high Douch Wolfzmilch: in base Almaigne
Wolfsmelck: in English Spourge.

Tithymalus mas, or Lactaria mascula, that is to say in French, Tithymale
masle: in English Wood Spourge.

Caryites: in Latin Tithymalus foemina, that is to say, in French Tithymale
femelle: in English Femall Tithymall, of Theodor Gaza Myrtaria, it may be named
in English Myrtell Spourge.

Paralios, and Tithymalus, or Mecon, of Theophraste (...), Coccos. This kind
may be well called in French Tithymale marin: in English Sea Spourge: in Douche
Zee Wolfsmelck.

Tithymalus solsequius, or Lactaria solsequia: in French Tithymale suyuant le
soleil, and Reueille matin: in Almaigne Sonnewend, Wolfsmelck: and in Brabant
Croonkens cruyt: in English Son Spourge, or Wartwurt.



Leptophyllos: in Latin Tithymalus arborescens, that is to say, Tithymal
growing like a tree: or Tree Tithymall.

Corymbites, and Amigdalites: in Latin Tithymalus latifolius, or Lactaria
latifolia, that is to say, Large leaued Tithymall or Spourge.

The Nature.
All the Tithymales are hoate and dry almost in the fourth degree, of a very
sharp, and biting quality, fretting and co^suming, first of all the milk or
sap, then the fruit and leaves. The root is of least strength. And amongst
all the Tithymales as Galen says, the male is the strongest, then the female,
thirdly the sixth kind, and the Tithymale with broad leaves. The fifth in
strength is that, which is like Cypres, the syxth is Sea Tithymall, the seventh
and of least force is the Son Spourge, or Tithymall following the Son.

The Virtues.










The Danger.
The juice, the seed, and roots of Tithymales, do work their effect with
violence, and are hurtful to the nature of man, troubling the body, and
ouerturning the stomach, burning and parching the throat, and making it rough
and sore, insomuch that Galen writes, that these herbs ought not to be
ministered or taken into the body, much less the juice ought to be dealt with,
but only it must be applied outwardly, and that with great discretion.

The correction or remedy.
If one lay the bark of the roots af Tithymales, to soke or stiepe in vinegar
by the space of a whole day, then if it be dried and made into powder, putting
to it of Annys of Fenell seed, gum Tragagante and Masticke, and so ministered
altogether with some refreshing or cooling liquor, as of Endive, Cicorie, or
Orenges, it will do his operation, without great trouble or pain, and will
neither chafe nor inflame the throat, nor the inward parts.

Of Ezula. Chap. xxx.
The Kinds.
EZula is of two sorts (as Mesue says) the great and small, whereunto
Dioscorides does agree, where as he writes, that Pityusa is small in one
place, and great in another.

Pityusa mayor. Great Ezula. Spourge Giant.


Pityusa minor. Small Ezula. Pyne Spourge.


The Description
forth at the sides of the stalks, like the seed of Tithymale, the root is
great and thick, covered over with a thick bark.



The Place.
The great Ezula in some Countries grows in wooddes and wilderness, and in
this Country in the gardens of Herboristes.

The lesser grows in rough stony places, and is found in this Country in
arable fields and banks, but not euerywhere.

The Time.
These herbs do flower about Midsomer, like the Tithymales.

The Names.
These herbs are called in Greek (...): in Latin Pityusa: in the Arabian
speech of Mesue Alscebran. in Shoppes Ezula, and Esula, and it should seem
that this name Esula, was borrowed of Pityusa: for in leaving out the first two
syllables Pity, there remains usa, whereof comes the diminutiue vsula, the
which is quickly turned into Ezula, or Esula.

The Nature.
Ezula is hoate and dry in the third degree, sharp, biting, and burning
inwardly, of nature much like Tithymale.

The Virtues.




The Danger.
As Ezula is like the Tithymales in nature and working, so it is of hurtful
quality agreeable to the same.

The Correction.
The evil quality of Ezula is amended, in like manner as Tithymale.

Of Spourge. Chap. xxxi.
The Description.
SPourge has a brown stalk, of two foot high or more, of the bigness of
ones finger. The leaves be long and narrow, like the leaves of a withie or
Almonde tree, the stalk breaks abroad at the top into many other little
branches, set with little round leaves, upon the same little branches grows
the triangled fruit, like the fruit of Palma Christi, but smaller, where in is
contained little round seeds, the which by force of the heat of the Son, do
skip out of their husks when the fruit is ripe. The root is of a woody
substance and not very thick.

All the herb with his stalks and leaves do yield a white milk like the
Tithymales being bursten or hurt.

The Place.
It is planted in many gardens of this Country.

The Time.
It has flowers and seed in July and August.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): and in Latin Lathyris: in Shoppes
Cataputia minor: of some, as Dioscorides says, Tithymalus: in French Espurge:
in high Douche Springkraut, Springkorner, and Treikorner: in base Almaigne
Springcruyt, and in some places of Flaunders Spurgie: in English Spurge.

The Nature.
This herb is hoate and dry in the third degree, and in faculty like
Tithymale.

The Virtues.




Lathyris.


The Danger.
Spurge is as hurtful to man's body as the Tithymales.

The Correction.
If one take the seed of Spurge with Dates, Figs, or gum Tragagante,
Mastik, Annys seed, or any cooling or refreshing herb, or if one drink water
straightwayes after the taking of the same seed, it will not stir up the
inflammation of the inward parts, nor much trouble the party receiving the
same, and it shall not be much hurtful to man's body.

Of Pety Surge. Chap. xxxi.
The Description.




The Place.
Peplos grows in this Country in gardens amongst pot herbs and beans, and
in some places amongst vines.

Peplos.


Sea Wartwurt or wild Porcelayne. Peplis.


Peplis, as Dioscorides reports, grows in salt ground by the Sea side.

The Time.
Peplos flowreth, and delivers his seed at Midsomer, like the Tithymales.

The Names.
Peplos is called in Greek (...): in Latin Peplus: in Shoppes Ezula rotunda*
in high Douche Teufels Milch: in base Almaigne Duyuels Melck: in French
Reueille matin des vignes: in English of some Wartwurt, and Spurge time, we may
call it after the Greek Peplos, or following the Douche, Dyuels milk, also Pety
Spurge, and Spurge time.

The other is called in Greek (...): in Latin Peplis: Hippocrates calls it
(...), Peplion, some call it Portulaca syluestris. Turner names this Sea
Wartwurt.

The Nature.
Peplos is hoate and dry in the third degree, like the Tithymmales: and Peplis
is of the like temperament.

The Virtues.
Peplos are both of like quality with the juice and seed of Spurge and
Tithymal, and serves to all ententes and purposes, as Tithymal does, wherefore
they lose the belly, and drive forth tough phlegm, with water and cholerique
humors.



Peplis, as Dioscorides writes.

The Danger and Remedy.
This herb is also hurtful unto man, neither more nor less, but even like
Spurge, and is corrected and amended in the same sort, as is declared in the
former Chapter.

Of Serapions Turbith. Chap. xxxiij.
The Description.
THis herb has long leaves, large, green, plain, and shining like in
fashion to the leaves of wade, amongst which comes forth a straight round
stalk, of the heyght of a foot and a half or there about, set with the like
leaves but smaller, it parts at the top into many branches, upon the which
grow fair flowers, blew before their opening, and when they are open they have
within a crown of yellow, compassed about with small azured leaves, like to
the flowers of Camomyll in figure. After when they fade they turn into a rough
or downie white seed, the which flies away with the wind. The root is long
and thick, and covered with a bark somewhat thick also.

The Place.
This herb grows along the sea coast, where as the tide and waves do ebb
and flow, in such sort, that sometimes it is covered with the Sea, and
sometimes it is dry. And it is found in abundance in Zealande.

The Time.
This herb flowreth in July and August.

The Names.
Some call it in Greek (...): in Latin Tripolium: in the Arabian speech of
Serapio, Chap. C C C xxx. Turbith: but this is not the Turbith of Mesue or
Auicenne. It has no name in our vulgar speech, that I know, but that some call
it blew Camomil or blew Dasies, the which name belongs not properly unto it,
seeing that it is not of the kind of Camomil or Dasies: we may very well call
it, Serapio his Turbith.

Tripolium.


The Nature.
The nature of Tripolium is hoate in the third degree.

The Virtues.






Of Mesues Turbith Thapsia. Chap. xxiiij.
The Description.
THapsia, as Dioscorides writes, is like Ferula, but his stalks be smaller,
and his leaves like Feuil. The flowers be yellow growing in tuffetes like Dyll.
The seed is broad, but not so broad as Ferula. The root is long and thick,
black without, and white within, having a thick bark full of white liquor
and sharp in taste.

The Place.
Thapsia grows in the I Will of Thapsus by Sicilia, and it is to be found at
this day upon the mount Garganus in Apulia, and in many other places of Italy.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Thapsia, Ferulago, and Ferula
syluestris: of Mesue in the Arabique tongue Turbith. And this is that Turbith
which ought to be used in Shoppes, in the composition of such medicines, as
Mesue has described.

The Nature.
Thapsia, but chiefly the bark of the root, is almost hoate in the third
degree, having thereunto adjoining a superfluous moisture, which is the cause
it does so quickly putrify, and cannot be kept long.

The Virtues.












The Danger.
In the gathering and drawing forth of the juice of this root, or the pith of
the same, there chances great inflammation in the face of him that draws it
forth, and his hands will rise full of blisters. And being received into the
body, it rayseth up great windiness, blastinges, tormoyling, and ouerturning
the whole body: and being to largely taken, it hurts the bowelles and inward
parts.

The Remedy.
When one will gather the juice of Thapsia, or strip the bark of the root, he
must annoint his face and naked parts with an ointment made with oil of Roses
and wax.

And when one will minister it inwardly to open the belly, he must put thereto
Ginger or long Pepper, and a little Sugar, and so to give it. For prepared after
this sort, it shall not be very hurtful to man's nature.

Of Hermodactil or Mede Saffron. Chap. xxxv.
Colchicum cum floribus. Wild Saffron with the flowers.


Colchici folia and Semen. Wild Saffron with his leaves and seed.


The Description.
HErmodactil has great broad leaves like the Lilly, three or four coming
forth of one root, amongst which grows the stalk about the heyght of a
foot, bearing triangled husks like to the Marsh flague or false Acorus, but
always smaller, the which being ripe do open them selves into three parts:
within that is enclosed a round seed, black, and hard. The flowers grow up
after the leaves and stalk are perished, upon short stemmes or stalks, like
the flowers of Saffron. The root is round, broad above, and narrow beneath,
white and sweet, covered with many coats or felmes, having by one side right
in the middle as it were a clift or parting, where as the stalk bearing the
flower grows. The root being dried becomes black.

There is also to be seen in Shoppes little white round roots, the which
they call Hermodactils in fashion partly like the aforesaid, but that they be
more flat, and have no division in the middle, as the abouesayde, but what
flowers and leaves they have, Mesue has not left us in writing.

The Place.
Medowe Saffron, as Dioscorides says, grows in Messenia, and in the I Will of
Colchis, whereas it took his first name. It is also found in this Country in
fat meadows, and great store of it is found about Viluorde, and about Bath in
England.

The Time.
The leaves of Meadow Saffron, come forth in March and April, the feed is ripe
in June, in July the leaves and stalk do perish. And in September the
pleasant flowers come forth of the ground.

The Names.
Agrestis Bulbus: in French Tue chien, or Mort aux chiens: in high Almaigne
Zeitlosen, and Wisen Zeitlosen: in base Almaigne of the Herboristes
Hermodactilen: Turner names it, Mede Saffron, and wild Saffron.

Hermodactilus, and by this name it is known in shoppes.

The Nature.
Meadow or wild Saffron is corrupt and venomous, therefore not used in medicine.

The second Hermodactill is hoate and dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.
That Hermodactil which is used in shoppes, drives forth by siege slymie
fleme, drawing the same from far parts, and is very good to be used against
the gowte, the Sciatica, and all pains in the joints.

The Danger.
Meadow Saffron taken into the body stirs up knawing and fretting in all the
body, as though all the body were rubbed with nettles, inflameth the stomach,
and hurts the inward parts, so that in fine it causes blooddy excrementes,
and within the space of one day death.

The other Hermodactil used in Shoppes, stirs up tossinges, wamlings,
windiness and vomiting, and subuerteth and ouerturneth the stomach.

The Remedy.
If any man by chance have eaten of wild Saffron, the remedy is to drink a
great draught of Cow milk, as master Turner has written.

If one put to that Hermodactill which is used in Shoppes, either Ginger, long
Pepper, Annys seed or Comin, and a little Mastik: so taken it does not
ouerturne the stomach, neither stirs up windiness.

Of Lauriel or Lowrye. Chap. xxxvi.
The Description.
LAuriel grows of the heigh of a foot and a half or more, it has many
tough branches which will not easily break with wresting or playing, covered
with a thick rind or bark: round about the said branches, but most commonly
at the top grow many leaves clustering together, thick and of a blackish
color, like in fashion to Baye leaves, but not so great, the which being
chewed in the mouth, do chafe and burn the mouth, tongue, and throat
exceedingly. The flowers grow upon short stemmes, joining and upon the leaves,
well clustering together about the stalk, of a white green or herby color.
The fruit in the beginning is green, and after being ripe, it is black almost
like a Baye berie, but lesser. The root is long and of a woody substance.

The Place.
Lauriel grows in rough mountains, amongst wood, and is found in the
Country of Liege and Namure, alongest the river Meuse, and in some places of
Almaigne. It grows also in many places of England.

The Time.
It flowreth all bytimes in February: the seed is ripe in May.

The Names.
This plant is called in Greek (...): Daphnoides: in Shoppes Laureola: in
French and base Almaigne Laureole: in high Almaigne Zeilandt: in English
Lauriell.

The Nature.
It is hoate and dry in the third degree, drawing near to the fourth.

The Virtues.


Daphnoides.




The Danger.
Lauriel does vex and ouerturne the stomach very much, and inflameth,
hurts, and burns the inward parts.

The Remedy.
The leaves of Lauriell are corrected and made more apt to be received, in like
manner as Chamelaea.

Of Mezereon. Chap. xxxvij.
The Kinds.
MEzereon, as Auicenne, Mesue, and Serapio do write, is of two sorts, whereof
one has broad leaves, the other narrow. And is set forth by the Ancient
Greek Physicians under these two names Chamelaea, and Thymelaea.

The Description.
CHamelaea is but a low plant, about the height of a foot and a half, or
two foot. The stalks be of a woody substance, full of branches: the leaves be
long, narrow and blackish, much like the leaves of the Olyue tree, but smaller.
At the highest of the stalks grow little pale or yellowishe flowers, and
afterward the threecornered fruit, like the Tithymales and Spourge, green at
the beginning, and red when it is ripe: after, blackish or brown when it is
dry: Chamelaea. Wydowayle.
Thymelaea.
whereof each seed is round almost like a Pepper corn, hard and bitter in
the beginning, and after hoate burning the mouth.

Thymelea has many small springes or branches of the length of a cubite, or a
cubite and a half, the leaves are small, lesser and narrower then the leaves of
Chamelea, and thicker. The flowers be small and white, growing at the top of
the springes or twigges. The fruit is green at the beginning and after red
like the Haw, or white thorn fruit, having within it a white kernel covered
with a little black skin, very hoate, and burning the tongue. These two plants
do never lose their leaves, but are always green, both in winter and somer.

The Place.
These plants do grow in rough vntoyled places, about high ways, and are
found in some places of France as in Languedock, and about Mompelier, great
store and abundance.

The Time.
Chamelea flowreth at ye beginning of somer, and yeldeth his sede in Autumn
Thymelea flowreth also in summer, and his fruit is ripe in August.

The Names.
The Arabian Physicians do call both these plants by the name of Mezereon, and
some call it Rapiens vitam, Et faciens Viduas.

Chamelaea, Oleago, Oleastellus, of some Citocacium, and it may be well called
Chamelaea tricoccos, to put a difference betwixt it and Chamela Germanica.

Thymelaea: of some (...), Cneoron, Cestron, and also Chamelaea: in the
Assyrian speech Apolinum, they are both unknown in the Shoppes of this
Country.

The seed of Thymelaea, is called in Greek (...): in Latin Granu^ Gnidium:
unknown also in Shoppes: for in steed thereof the Apothecaries of this
Country do use the seed of common Mezereon, of the which we will speak in
the Chapter following. And others take another black round seed or fruit,
named Cuculus Indus, the which name should seem to come of Coccus Gnidius.

The Nature.
Both kinds of these herbs are hoate and dry in the third degree, drawing
very near to the fourth degree: they be very hoate and sharp, making great
heat in the throat when one does chew thereon.

The Virtues.


Thymelaea, when one does take the pulpe of twenty graynes.

Chamelaea pound with honey, does mundifie and cleanse corrupt ulcers.

The Danger.
The quality of these herbs approaches very near to the nature of venom,
being diverse ways very evil and hurtful to mankind. It brings great hurt to
the stomach, the liver, and to all the noble and principal parts of man,
chasing, hurting, and searching, causing ulcers in the entrayles, and in fine
purging the belly until bleeding.

The Remedy.
The green leaves of Chamelaea must be stieped a day and a night in good
strong vinegar, then dried and kept to occupy. If first ye lay to soke in the
said vinegar, Quinces, or the seed of Barberies, it shall be the more apt for
to prepare the said leaves of Chamelaea. And when ye will occupy of your
leaves so prepared ye must make them into powder, and give it with Annys seed
and Mastik, or ye must boil them in whaye of sweet milk, and specially of
Goats milk, or in the broth of a Capon, and then minister the said whaye or
broth.

Of Douch Mezereon. Chap. xxxviij.
The Description.
THat Mezereon, the which is called in Douche Seidelbast, is a little shrubbe,
or tree of three or four foot high, with short branches which will not easily
break, upon the same are long leaves like Priuet, but whiter and tenderer. The
flowers grow along the branches of a purple color and sweet savor, after
which comes the berries, which are first green, and red when they be ripe:
after when they be dry, they become black and wrinkled: and are like
Hempseede when one has taken from them their withered Skin, but they are
little rounder, and bigger. And when they be chewed, they are found very hoate
and strongly burning in the mouth and throat. The which the seed only does
not, but also the leaves, bark, and root.

The Place.
Mezereon grows in diverse places of Almaigne in moist dark woods, and in
rough vntoyled places.

The Time.
It flowreth bytime in February and March, before it bears leaves, and the
fruit becomes red and ripe in August and September.

The Names.
This plant is called in Shoppes of Almaigne Mezereon, of some Piper montanu^,
and at has been taken a long time for the right Chamelea, wherefore it may be
well called Chamela Germanica, in high Douch Scidelbast, Leuzkraut, and
Ketterhals: in base Almaigne Zeelbast, and most commonly Mezereon.

The seed of this plant is wrongfully taken of the Apothecaries of this
Country for Coccos Gnidios, and is called of the common people Dronkaerts
besiekens, that is to say, Drunkards berries, because that after one has eaten
of these berries, he cannot easily swallow or get down drink.

The Nature.
The leaves, bark, root, and fruit of this plant, are hoate and dry, almost
in the fourth degree, and of quality like the root of Thymelea.

Camelaea Germanica.


The Virtues.




The Danger.
This plant is without doubt hurtful unto the body, because it is very hoate,
and of strong and vehement working, wherefore it does hurt and grieve the
inward parts.

The Remedy.
The leaves of this Mezereon are prepared even as the leaves of Chamelaea, and
in like manner ought the fruit and bark to be ordered, when one will give them
to be taken with any medicine.

Of Stauisaker. Chap. xxxix.
The Description.
STaphis-acre has straight stalks of a brown color, with leaves cloven or
cut into five, six, or seven cliftes, almost like the leaves of the wild vine.
The flowers grow upon short stemmes of a fair blewe of sky color, parted
into five or six little leaves: when they are gone there comes up close
husks, wherein is contained a triangled seed, black, sharp, and burning the
mouth, the root is of a woody substance, and single.

The Place.
The Herboristes of this Country do sow it in their gardens, and it grows
prosperously in shadowy places.

The Time.
Staphis-acre flowreth at Midsomer.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Herba pedicularis, or
Pituitaria, of some in Greek (...), that is to say, Lousebane, or (...): in
shops Staphis agria: in French Staphisaigre, or Herb aux pouilleux: in high
Douche Leuszkraut, and Speichelkraut: in base Almaigne Luyscruyt, and the seed
made into powder Luysepouder, that is to say, Lousepowder.

The Nature.
Staphisacre, especially the seed, is hoate almost in the fourth degree.

The Virtues.




Staphisagria.








The Danger.
The seed of Stafisaker to be taken inwardly, is very hurtful to nature, for
it chafeth and inflameth all inward parts, and ouerturneth the stomach, if
one hold it in his mouth, it causes inflammation in the mouth and throat:
wherefore one ought not rashly to use this seed, except it be given outwardly.

The Remedy.
Before ye occupy the seed of Stafisakre, ye must stipe it in vinegar and
dry it, and when it is dry, ye may give it to drink with Meade or watered
honey. Meade is honey and water boiled together, and whosoever has received of
this seed, must walk without staying, and should drink Hidromel very often,
when he feels any kind of choking, and in this doing it shall perform his
operation without any great danger.

Of the wild spirting Eueumbre. Chap. xl.
The Description.
Wild Cucumbre has leaves somewhat round and rough, but lesser and rougher
then the leaves of common Cucumber. The stalks be round and rough, creeping
along the ground without any claspers or holders, upon which out of the
holownesse of the collateral branches or wings, amongst ye leaves grow short
stemmes bearing a flower of a faynte yellow color, after the flowers there
comes little rough Cucumbers of the bigness and length of ones thombe, full
of sap with a brown kernel, the which being ripe, skippeth forth as soon as
one touch ye Cucumbers. The root is white, thick, and great, with many other
small roots hanging by. All the herb is of a very bitter taste, but
especially the fruit, whereof men use to gather the juice and dry it, the
which is used in medicine.

The Place.
This herb is found in the gardens of Herboristes of this Country: and where
as it has been once sown, it comes easily again every year.

The Time.
These Cucumbers do flower in August, and their seed is ripe in September.

The Names.
This Cucumber is called in Greek (...): in Latin Cucumis Agrestis,
syluestris, and erraticus: of some Cucumis anguinus: in shoppes Cucumis
asininus: in English Wild Cucumbre: in French Concombre sauuage: in high
Douche Wild Cucumer, or Esels Cucumer: in base Almaigne Wild Concommeren, or
Esels Concommeren: in English Wild Cucumber, or leaping Cucumber.

Cucumissyluestris.


The juice of the root being dry, is called Elaterium: in shoppes Elacterium.

The Nature.
The juice of wild Cucumbre is hoate and dry in the second degree, and of a
resolving and clensing nature. The root is of the same working, but not so
strong as the juice.

The Virtues.


















The Danger.
Elaterium taken into the body, hurts the inward parts, and opens the small
veins, provoke gripinges and torments in the belly in doing his operation.

The Remedy.
To cause that it shall do no hurt, it must be given with Mede, or with sweet
milk, a little salt and Annys seed, or give it in powder with gum
Tragagante, a little Annys seed and salt.

Of Coloquintiba. Chap. xli.
The Description.




Colocynthis.


The Place.




The Time.
Coloquintida brings forth his fruit in September.

Colocynthis of Paulus Aegineta Sicyonia: in shoppes Coloquintida: in Douche
Coloquint opffelin, and Coloquint appel.

Cucurbita syluestris: in French Courge sauuage: in Douch Wild Cauwoorden, for
this is a kind of the right Goorde.

The Nature.
Coloquintida is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.








The Danger.
Coloquintida is exceeding hurtful to the heart, the stomach and liver, and
troubles and hurts the bowelles, and other parts of the entrayles.

The Remedy.
Ye must put to the pulpe or pithe of Coloquintida gum Tragan^and Masticke,
and after make it into trochisques or balls with honey: for of this they use to
make medicine.

Of Gratia Dei. Chap. xlij.
The Description.
CRatiola is a low herb, about a spanne long, something like to common
hysope, with many square stalks or branches, the leaves are somewhat large,
broader then the leaves of hysope, and longer then the leaves of the lesser
Centaurie. The flowers grow betwixt the leaves upon short stemmes, of a white
color mixed with a little blewe. All the herb in taste is bitter, almost like
the lesser Centaurie.

The Place.
This herb delights to grow in low and moist places, and is found in
meadows: in this Country the Herboristes do plant it in their gardens.

The Time.
This herb is in flower in July and August.

The Names.
This herb is called of men in these days in Latin Gratiola, and of some
also Gratia Dei, that is to say, the grace of God: and Limnesion: in Italian
Stanca cauallo: and to the eye it shows to be a kind of Centaurium minus,
and therefore of some it is called Centauris.

The Nature.
Gratiola without doubt is of nature hoate and dry, and in deed it is more dry
then hoate, in quality very like unto the less Centorie.

The Virtues.




Gratiola.


Of Seen. Chap. xliij.
The Description.
SEna is but a little low plant, with small tender branches, the leaves are
soft and tender, and somewhat round or hooked, not much differing from the
leaves of Fenugrek. The flowers be of a pale or faint yellowe color: the
which fallen or faded away, there comes small coddes or husks flat and
crooked, having a flat seed, and somewhat brown.

The Place.
Sena grows in Alexandria, and in many places of Italy and Prouence, but the
best is that of Alexandria.

The Time.
Men do sow it in the spring time, it flowreth at Midsomer, and brings
forth his coddes, sodaynely after men gather and dry it.

The Names.
Sena is called of Actuarius in Greek, and of the Arabian Physicians in their
Sena.
language Sena: and by that name it is known of the Apothecaries in France,
Flaunders, and England.

The Nature.
The coddes and leaves of Sena are hoate in the second degree, and dry in the
first.

The Virtues.






The Choice.
The coddes after the opinion of Mesn^^ are best to be used in medicine, and
next the leaves, but the stalks and bran^s are unprofitable.

The Danger.
Sena provoke windiness, and gripinges in the belly, and is of a very slack
operation.

The Correction or Remedy..
You must put to Sena Annys seed, Ginger, and some Sal Gemme. Or you must
boil it with Annys seed, Raysons, and a little Ginger: for being so prepared
and dressed, it makes his operation quickly, and without any greet. H. Fuchins
lib. primo, De Compos. medic. bids in the correction of Sena, to use Mastick
and Cloves. Cynamome is excellent for the same purpose, as you may see in
Matthiolus upon Dioscorides.

Of Elder or Gourtre. Chap. xliiij.
The Kinds.
Such as do travel at this day in the knowledge of Simples, do find that
there be two kinds of Elder: whereof one is very common and well known. The
other is geason, and not very well known, and therefore it is called Wild or
strange Elder.

The Description.
clustering together in tuftes, like flowers of Parsenep. And when those
flowers be fallen, there come little pretty round beries, first green, and
after black, out of the which they wring a red juice, or winelike liquor.
In the said beries is contained the seed which is small and flat.

Of this kind of Elder, there is yet found another sort, the beries whereof
are white turning toward yellow, in all things else like to the other: and
this kind is strange, and but seldom seen.



Sambucus.


The Place.




The Time.




The Names.
Sambucus: in French Suyn, or Hus: in high Douch Holder: in base Almaigne
Vlier.

Sambucus syluestris, and Sambucus ceruinus: in high Douche Waldt Holder: in
base Almaigne Wild Vlier.

The Nature.


The Virtues.


the leaves and tender croppes, but that it is of a stronger operation, purging
the said humors with pain and violence.







The Danger.
Elder of his own nature is very evil for man, for it stirs up a great
desire to vomit with great tossing and troubles to the stomach, in the
bowelles, and belly. It makes all the body weak and feeble, and wastes the
strength and health of the liver.

Of Walwort / or Dane wort. Chap. xlv.
The Description.
ALbeit Walwort is no tree, norplant of a woody substance, but an herb that
springs up, every year a new from his root: yet notwithstanding it lyketh
us best in this place to set out his description, not only because he is like
unto Elder, but also, because the auncientes have always set and described
Elder and Walwort together, the which I thought good to imitate in this matter.
Therefore Walwort is no woody plant, but an herb having long stalks, great,
straight, and cornered, parted by knottes, and joints, as the branches of
Elder, upon which grows the leaves of a dark green color, parted into
diverse other leaves, much like to the leaves of Elder, both in figure and
smell. At the highest of the stalks, it brings forth his flowers in tuftes,
and afterward it has seed and beries like Elder. The root is as big as a
man's finger, of a reasonable good length, fitter to be used in medicine then
the root of Elder, the which is hard, and therefore not so fit as Walwort.

Ebulus.


The Place.
Walwort grows in places vntoyled, near unto high ways, and sometimes in
the feeldes, specially there where as is any moisture or good ground and
fruitful.

The Place.




The Time.
White Bryonie begins to flower in May, and the fruit is ripe in September.

The Names.
Vitis alba: in the Arabian tongue Alphesera, of Mattheus Syluaticus,
Viticella: in Shoppes Bryonia: in French Couleuree blanch: in high Almaigne
Stichwurtz, and Hunds kurbs: in base Almaigne Bryonie.

Vitis nigra, and Bryonia nigra, of some (...), that is, Chironia vitis. And it
may be well called in French Couleuree noire: in high Douche Schwartz
Stickwurtz: in base Almaigne Swerte Bryonie.

The herb, which some think to be the black Bryonie, is called of some
Christophariana, and of others Costus niger, albeit it is nothing like the
right Costus.

The Nature.




The Virtues.
















And the leanes and fruit are as profitable for the same intent, if it be laid
to in like manner.













The Danger.
The root of Brionie by his violence does trouble and ouerturne the stomach,
and other of the inner parts. Moreover the same with his leaves, fruit,
stalks, and roots, is altogether contrary and evil to women with child,
whether it be prepared or not, or whether it be mingled with other medicines:
insomuche that one cannot give of the said root, or any other medicine
compounded of the same, without great danger and peril.

The Correction.
The malice or noughtie quality thereof is taken away, by putting thereto
Masticke, Ginger, Cinamome, and to take it with honey, or with the decoction of
Raysons.

Of the wild Vine / Brionie / or Our Zadies Seal. Chap. xlvij.
The Description.
OUR Ladies Seal has long branches, flexible, of a wooddishe substance,
covered with a gaping or cloven bark, growing very high, and winding about
trees and hedges, like the branches of the Vine. The leaves are like the leaves
of Morelle or garden Night shade, but much greater, not much varying from the
leaves of the greater Wythie wind or Bindeweede: the flowers be white, small,
and mossie, after the fading of which flowers, the fruit comes clustering
together like little grapes or Raysons, red when it is ripe, hanging within
three or four kernelles or seeds. The root is very great and thick, and
sometimes parted or divided at the end, into three or four parts, of a
brownishe color without, and white within, and clammie like the root of
Comferie.

The Place.
In this Country, this herb grows in low and moist woods, that are shadowed
and waterie.

The Time.
It flowreth in May and June, and the fruit is ripe in September.

The Names.
It is called in Greek (...): in Latin Vitis syluestris, that is to say, the
Wild Vine, yet this is not that kind of wild Vine, the which men call Labrusca,
for that resembles altogether the garden and manured Vine, but this (as is
aforesaid) is a plant or herb of the kinds of Bryonie, the which is also
called in Greek Ampelos, that is to say, a vine, because that it grows high,
winding it self about trees and hedges like the vine. And of this I have
thought good to give warning, lest any hereafter happen to fall into error,
with Auicen, Serapion, and other of ye Arabian Physicians, thinking that
Labrusca and Vitis syluestris, should be any other then one self plant.
Columel calls this plant Tamus. by following, of whom Pliny called the
fruit Vua Taminea, and this plant is called in some places Salicastrum. It is
called in Shoppes of some Apothecaries Sigillum beatae Mari, that is to say,
the Seal or Signet of our Lady: in Italian Tamato: it may be called in
French Couleuree sauuage: in Douche Wild Bryonie, because it is a kind of
Bryonie, as a difference from the right wild Vine.

Vitis syluestris.


Some take this herb for Cyclaminus altera, but their opinion may be easily
reproved, and found false, because this herb has a very great root, and as
Dioscorides writes, Cyclaminus altera has an unprofitable and vain root.
that is to say, very small and of no substance.

The Nature.
Wild Bryonie is hoate and dry, good to mundifie, purge, and dissolve.

The Virtues.








Of Clematis altera. Chap. xlviij.
The Kinds.
OF this kind of plant or Withywinde, the which for a difference from
Pereuincle (which is named Clematis in Latin) and therefore men call this kind
Clematis altera, there be found two kinds, over and bysides that plant which
is now called in Latin Vitalba, and in French Viorne, the which some do
also judge to be a kind of Clematis altera.

Clematisaltera. Biting Pereuincle.


Clematis alterius altera species. Bushe Pereuincle.


The Description.
Clematis altera, has small branches, flexible, and tender, by the which it
stands and climbeth up. The leaves be long and large, growing three or four
together, very sharp and biting the tongue. The little flowers be white. The
root is little and small, and full of heary threddes or stringes.



Vitalba, or as the French men term it Viorne, which some take for Clematis
altera, has long branches full of joints, easy to ploy, bigger, longer, and
thicker then the branches of the aforesaid, not much differing from the
branches of the vine, by the which it climbeth upon, and about trees and
hedges: upon the said branches grow the leaves, which for the most part are
made and do consist of five leaves: whereof each leaf is of a reasonable
breadth, and not much unlike to the leaves of Iuye, but smaller. The flowers
do grow as it were by tuftes, and many together, of a white color, and well
smelling, after which flowers past, comes the seed which is small and
somewhat brown, bearing small, crooked, and downie stemmes: the root is very
full of small stringes, or hearie threddes.

The Place.
Clematis altera, is a strange herb, and not found in this Country, except in
the gardens of some Herboristes.





The Time.


Vitalba Viorne, or Wild Vine.




The Names.
Clematis altera, Ambuxum, Epigetis, and of some of our time Flammula.

Clematis altera, because of the likeness it has with the other, albeit his
leaves do not much bite upon the tongue.

Vitalba: in French Viorne: in high Douch Lijnen or Lenen, and of some
Waldreben. Some learned men take this herb for a kind of Clematis altera,
although his leaves likewise have no very great biting sharpness, upon the
tongue. Wherefore it should be rather judged of me, to be more like the herb
which men call in Greek (...): in Latin Cyclaminus altera, of some
Cissanthemon, and Ciffophilon, whereof we have written before in the eleventh
Chapter of this third book.

The Nature.
The leaves of Clematis altera, are hoate in the beginning of the fourth degree.

The Virtues.
Clematis altera, taken with water, or Mede made with water and honey, purges
downewarde cholerique humors, with gross and tough fleme, as says
Dioscorides.



Cyclaminus altera, dronken with white wine forty days together, does heal
the stoppinges and hardness of the Melte or Spleen, purging the same both by
siege, and urine. And is profitable for them that are short winded, to be taken
into the body.

Of Iuye. Chap. xlix.
The Kinds.
THere be three kinds of Iuye, as Dioscorides writes. The first has a white
fruit and is unknown unto us. The second bears a black or yellowish
fruit, and of this kind there grows great plenty in this Country. The
third kind is small, and creeps along upon the ground, and this kind
brings no fruit.

Hedera nigra. Black Iuye.


Hedera Helix. Small Iuye. Barren Iuye.


The Description.




The Place.




The Time.
The black Iuie flowreth in summer, and the fruit is ripe in winter.

The Names.
Iuie is called in Greek (...), and of some (...): in Latin Hedera: in high
Douche Ephew, or Eppich: in base Almaigne Veyl.

Hedera alba, and of Pliny Hedera foemina.

Hedera nigra, and (...), Dionysia, of Pliny Hedera mas, and that kind which
embraces trees, is called (of men in these days) Hedera arborea, and that
which grows upon walls, Hedera muralis: in French Lyarre noir: in high Douch
Schwartzer Eppich, and Maur Ephew, or Baum Ephew: in base Almaigne Veyl; and
Boom Veyl, or Muer Veyl.

Clauicula, and Hederula: in French Petit Lyarre: in high Douthe Klein Ephew:
in base Almaigne Cleyne Veyl.

The cause of the Name.
Iuie is called in Greek Cissos, because of a certain Maiden or Damsel,
whose name was Cissus, the which at a feast or banquet (whereunto the Gods
were al bidden) so daunced before Bacchus, and kissed him often, making such
mirth and joy, that being overcome with the same fell to the ground, and killed
her self. But as soon as the earth knew thereof, she brought forth immediately
the Iuie bushe, bearing still the name of the young Damosel Cissus, the which as
soon as it grows up a little, comes to embrace the Vine, in remembrance
that the Damsel Cissus was wont so to love and embrace Bacchus the God of
wine.

The Nature.
The Iuie is partly cold, dry, and astringent, and partly hoate and sharp.
Moreover being green, it has a certain superfluous moystnesse and humiditie,
the which vanishes when it is dry.

The Virtues.








heals ulcers, and the corrupt sores happening in the same, and it does the
like to the sores and ulcers in the nose.











The Danger.
The fruit of Iuye taken in to great a quantity, weakeneth the heart, and
troubles the sense and understanding. The use thereof is also very dangerous
for women, especially for women with child, and such as are newly delivered.

Of ground Iuye. Chap. l.
The Description.
Ground Iuye has many square tender stalks growing forth from a root full
of threddes or stringes, upon which grow leaves somewhat round, uneven, and
indented round about, of a strong smell and bitter taste, smaller, rounder,
and tenderer then the leaves of Iuye. The flowers do grow amongst the leaves,
in taste bitter, and of a purple color.

The Place.
Ground Iuye is very common in all this Country, and grows in many gardens,
and shadowie moist places.

The Time.
It flowreth from April, unto the end of summer, and continues green the
most part of all the year.

The Names.
This herb is called of men in these days, in Latin Hedera terrestris, and
Corona terrae: and by this name it is known of the Apothecaries. It is called
in French Lyarre, or Lierre terrestre: in high Douche Gundelreb, and Grundreb:
in base Almaigne Onderhaue. And this herb has been long time taken, for that,
which is called in Greek, (...), Chamaecissus, but as I do think, it is better
like (...), for which it is taken of some.

Hedera terrestris officinarum.


The Nature.
Ground Iuye is hoate and dry.

The Virtues.


Of Woodbine or Honysuckle. Chap. li.
Periclymenum. Woodbine or Honysuckce.


Periclymeni tertia species. The third kind of Periclymenum.


The Description.






The Place.
Woodbine grows in all this Country in hedges, about enclosed feeldes, and
amongst broom or firres. It is found also in woods, especially the two last
recited kinds. The third kind grows in many places of Sauoye, and in the
Country of the Swysers.

The Time.
Woodbine flowreth in June, and July: the seed is ripe in August and September.

The Names.
Aegina, Carpathon, Splenio^, Epaetitis, Clematitis, and Calycanthemon: in
Latin Volucrum maius, Periclymenum, and Syluae matter: of the Apothecaries
Caprifolium, and Matter Sylua, and of some Lilium inter spinas: in French
Cheurefueille: in high Almaigne Geiszbladt, Speckgilgen, Zeunling, and
Waldgilgen: in base Almaigne Gheytenbladt, and Mammekens cruyt: in English
Honysuckle, or Woodbine, and of some Caprifoyle.



The Nature.
Woodbine is hoate and dry, almost in the third degree.

The Virtues.








The Danger.
The leaves and fruit of Woodbine, are very hurtful to women with child, and
altogether contrary.

Of smothe Bindweede / or Withiwinde. Chap. lij.
The Kinds.
TThere be two sorts of Bindeweede or withywinde, the one bearing a blewe
flower, the other a white, whereof one is great, the other small. The greater
kind windeth it self about hedges and trees, the lesser most commonly trayleth
upon the ground.

Smilax lenis mayor. Gentle Withiwinde the great.


Smilax lenis minor. Chamaecissus. Gentle Withiwinde the small.


The Description.




smaller, and most commonly it creeps along upon the ground. The branches
are small and smooth: the little leaves are tender and soft: the flowers are
like to little belles of a purple or flesh color: the seed is cornered or
angled, as the seed of the others.

The Place.






The Time.




The Names.
The Withiwinde or Bindeweede is called in Greek (...), of Galen (...). Milax:
in Latin Smilax lenis, of Marcus Cato Coniugulum: in shoppes Volubilis, of
some Campanula, and Funis arborum: in French Liset, or Liseron: in Douche
Wind, and Wranghe.

Coniugulum nigrum: and after the opinion of some learned men in these days,
of Columella in hortis, Ligustrum nigrum: of Herboristes Campana Lazura.

Volubilis mayor: in high Douche Grosz Windenkraut, and Groszweisz glocken: in
base Almaigne Groote Wind. This kind is taken of some to be Ligustrum album,
whereof Virgil treats.

Volubilis minor: in French Campanette, or Vitreole: in high Douchlande Klein
Windenkraut: in Nether Douchlande Cleyne cloexkens Wind. And it seems to be
much like to that which the Greeks call (...) in Latin Chamaecissus, and
Hedera terrestris.

The Nature.
Bindeweede or Withiwinde, is of a hoate and dry quality or nature.

The Virtues.
Withiwinde or Bindeweede, is not fit to be put in medicine, as Galen and
Pliny witnesses.

Of black Withiwinde / or Bindeweede. Chap. liij.
The Description.
Black Bindeweede has smothe red branches, very small like great threddes,
wherewithal it wrappeth and windeth it self about trees, hedges, stakes, and
about al herbs that it may catch or take hold upon. The leaves are like to
Iuie, but smaller and tenderer, much resembling the leanes of the white
Bindeweede. The flowers be white and very small. The seed is black and
triangled, or three square, like to the seed of Bockweyde or Bolymong, but
smaller and blacker, growing thick together. Every seed is enclosed and
conered with a little skin. The root is also small and tender as a thread.

The Place.
Black Bindweede grows in Vineyardes, and in the borders of feeldes, and
gardens, about hedges and ditches, and amongst herbs.

The Time.
It delivers his seed in August and September, and afterward it perishes.

The Names.
This kind of Bindeweede is called in Greek (...), and of the Emperor
Constantine (...), Malacocissos, hoc est, Mollis Hedera. Some call it in Latin
Conuoluolus, of some Vitealis, that is to say, Bindeweede of the Vineyardes, or
belonging to the Vine: in Shoppes Volubilis media, that is to say, The mean
Bindeweede: in high Douche Swerte wind, and Middelwinde: in English Weed
wind, and Windweede, or Iuybindweede.

The Nature.
Swerte Bindeweede is of a hoate nature, and has power to dissolve.

The Virtues.




Helxine Cissampelos.


Of Soldanella or Sea Cawle. Chap. liiij.
The Description.
SOldanella has many small branches, somewhat red, by the which it trayleth or
creeps along the ground, casting or spreading it self here and there,
covered or decked here and there with little, round, green leaves, more rounder
and smaller, then the leaves Asarabacca, or like to the leaves of the round
Aristolochia, or Birthworte, but smaller. The flowers are like them of the
lesser Bindeweede, of a bright red, or incarnate color. The seed is black,
and grows in husks or round coddes, like the Bindeweedes. The root is
small and long. But to conclude, this kind of Bindeweede is much like the
lesser Withiwinde, saving that the leaves are much rounder and thicker, and of
a saltish taste.

Brassica Marina.


The Place.
This herb grows abundantly in Zealande upon the Sea banks, and along the
coast, or Sea side in Flaunders, and in all salt ground standing near the Sea.

The Time.
This herb flowreth in June, after which time men may gather it, to keep to
serve in medicine.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Brassica Marina: in Shoppes of
the Apothecaries and common Herbaries, Soldanella: in high Douche Zee wind.

The Nature.
Soldanella, is hoate and dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.


The Danger.
Soldanella, especially if it be taken in powder, hurts and troubles the

and it must be so received, in powder altogether.

Of Rough Bindeweede. Chap. lv.
The Description.
ROugh or prikeley Bindeweede has tender stalks and branches, garnished, or
set round about, with many sharp pricks or thorns, winding and wrappyng it
self about trees, hedges and bushes like to the other kinds of Bindeweede,
taking hold with their clasping branches upon every thing standing against
it. The leaves be very well like Iuye, but they are longer and sharper at the
point. The flowers are white, and for his fruit, it has round beries
clustering together like grapes, the which are red when they be ripe. The
root is thick and hard.

The Place.
Rough Bindeweede, as witnesses Pliny, grows in vntoyled waterie places,
and in low and shadowie valleys. It is not found in this Country, but in
the gardens of some diligent Herboristes.

Smilaxaspera.


The Time.
Rough Bindeweede flowreth in the spring time, but in hoate Countries it
flowreth again in Autumn.

The Names.
This Bindeweede is called in Greek (...): in Latin Smilaxaspera, of some
Volubilis acuta, or Pungens: in French Smilax aspre, or Liset piquant: in high
Douch Stechend windt: in base Almaigne Steke^de wind. And the root of this
plant is the Zarsa parella, or as some do write Sparta parilla. The which some
of our time commend very much for diverse diseases, albeit very small effect
comes thereof.

The Nature.
This herb is hoate and dry.

The Virtues.




Of Scammonie. Chap. lvi. Scammonea. Diadrygium.
The Description.
SCammonie is a kind of Windeweede, which brings forth many branches from
one root, of the length of four or five foot, meetely great and thick,
having leaves triangled and rough, not much varying from the leaves of the
black Bindeweede, almost like the leaves of Iuye, but more softer. The flowers
be white and round, fashioned like a Cup or Bell, of a strong and noughtie
savor. The root is long, very thick, and of a strong savor, full of sap or
juice, the which men do gather and dry calling it Scammonium, and is of great
use in Physic.

The Place.
It grows in Asia, Mysia, Syria, and Judea, but the best comes from Asia,
and Mysia.

The Names.
This Bindeweede or Windeweede, is called in Greek (...), and of some also, as
Dioscorides writes, (...), of the Ancient Romans in Latin Colophonium.

The juice of the root dried, is called in Greek (...): in Latin Scammonium.
in Shoppes when it is yet unprepared, Scommonea, and when it is prepared,
Diagredium, or Diagridium.

The Nature.
Scammonie is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.


with vinegar, it heals all spreading scabbes, scuruinesse, and hardness of
the skin.





The Danger.
Scammonie, that is the juice of Scammonium, is a very strong and violent
medicine, bringing a number of inconveniences; and dangerous evils, if it be
either taken unprepared, or out of due time and place.

First, it overcomes and tormenteth the stomach very much, causing wambling
and windiness in the same.

Secondarily, it does by heat so chafe the liver and blood, that it engenders
fevers, in such as be of a hoate complexion.

Thirdly, it opens the veins, and hurts the bowels and inward parts, even
to the provoking of blooddy excrementes. And therefore without doubt, Scammonie
is very hurtful to the liver, the heart, and other inward parts.

The Correction.
The first danger is corrected, by putting the Scammonie to boil, or digest in
a Quince, or in the paste of Quinces, until the said Quinces be very tender,
and perfectly boiled. When the Scammonie is thus prepared, it is called
Diagredium.

The second danger is prevented, by mixing your Scammonie, with some cold
juice, as of roses, Psylium, or with the substance or pulpe of prunes.

The third is amended, by putting to the Diagredium, some Masticke, or the
juice of Quinces.

Of Dulcamara. Chap. lvij.
The Description.

lesser, having sometime two ears, or two little leaves adjoining to the lowest
part of the same leaves, like unto frank Sage. The flouers be blew growing
together, every flower divided or parted, into five little narrow leaves,
having in ye middle, a small yellowe prick or point. The flowers being past,
there come in their steed long beries, red, and very plain or smoth, of a
strange savor, clustering together like the beries of Iuie. The root is small
and threddy.

Dulcamera. Wood Nightshade.

Of Doder or Cuscuta. Chap. lviij.
The Description.
DOder is a strange herb, without leaves, and without root, like unto a

hedges and bushes, and other herbs. The thredes be sometimes red, sometimes
white, upon the said threedes are fastened, here and there little round heads
or knoppes, bringing forth at the first, small white flowers, and afterward a
little seed.

The Place.
This herb grows much in this Country upon Brambles, Hoppes, and upon
Line or Flax, and sometimes it is also found growing upon other herbs,
especially in hoate Countries, as upon Thyme, Winter Sauerie, Tithymale,
Germander, Sea Holme, but it is very little and small, and in dry places of
this Country it grows upon Wodwaxen, and upon wormwood, as I have seen in
my garden.

The Time.
Most commonly, this herb is found in July and August, and after that, it
bears his flower and seed.

The Names.

Scorfte, and of some Wrange, and Vildtcruyt. The Doder which grows upon
Thyme, is named of the Ancient Greek Physicians and of the Arabians Epithymu^:
and in like manner you may call by diverse names ye Doder growing upon and about
other herbs, according to ye diversity of ye same, as Cassytha.
Epichamaedris, that which grows upon Germander. Epitithymalos, that which
grows upon Tithymale. Eperingium, which grows about Sea Holme.

Brambles. Epilinum, which grows upon Flax. Epibryon, which windeth about
Hoppes. Epapsinthion, which grows about Wormwood. Et sic de alijs.
ss

The Nature.
The nature of this herb changes, according to the nature and quality of the
herbs, whereon it grows, insomuche that, that which grows upon hoate
herbs, as Thyme, Sauerie, and Tithymale, is likewise very hoate. That which
grows upon other herbs, is not so fervent hoate. Nevertheless of it self,
it is somewhat hoate and dry.

Rosa Solis, has reddishe leaves, somewhat round, hollow, rough, with long
stemmes, almost fashioned like little spoones, amongst the which comes up a
short stalk, crooked at the top, and carrying little white flowers. This
herb is of a very strange nature and marvelous: for although that the Son do
shine hoate, and a long time thereon, yet you shall find it always moist and
bedewed, and the small hears thereof always full of little drops of water:
and the hoater the Son shines upon this herb, so much the moystier it is,

that this is the first kind of (...), that is to say, Fucus, or Alga, whereof
Dioscorides treats in his fourth book.

Fucus, and Alga: this is the second kind of Fucus in Dioscorides, the which
Theophrastus names also in Greek (...), that is to say in Latin Porrum,
because the leaves are like unto Leeke blades.

The Nature.






Ros Solis is hoate and dry almost in the fourth degree.

Ranunculus, that is called Illyricus, has thin stalks, and thereon grow
cut leaves, and with white, small, soft hears, the flowers be of a pale
yellowe, the seed is as the other: but the roots are otherwise, and be as
many, and somewhat more then the wheat or barlie corns joining together, out
of the which some threddes sprout, with the which it sets forth and
multiplieth.

Of this kind there is yet also another strange Ranunculus, and it has long
narrow leaves, as grass, of color after white and blew, drawing it out of the
green. The flowers and seeds are as the aforesaid, but the roots are
threddie.

To this kind of Ranuculus is drawn another herb which is called Passeflower,
and it has rough hearie stemmes, all iagged, and small cut, or splitte,
sometimes thick maned, and lying for the most part upon the ground: at the
highest of the stalks grow flowers, almost after the fashion of little
Cymballes, having in the insyde small yellowe threedes, as in the middle of a
Rose, of color most purple brown, sometimes white, and in some places red or
yellow, and when the flowers be fallen, there comes up a round head, covered
over with a certain gray and brown hear.

Ranunculus Illyricus.


Ranunculus Lusitanicus.


Ranunculus, is lesser and lower then the aforesaid, his leaves be broad and
undivided, and slipperie: between these two there grows a stalk, and one
flower thereupon like unto the other, of a fair yellow color like unto gold,
and of a very pleasant smell. The roots are of many corns gathered, the which
be longer then the roots of Ranunculus Illyricus



Ranunculus, is yet another stange kind reckoned, the which is called Troll
flowers, and it has great leaves divided into many parts, and cut round
about: the flowers grow vppermoste of the stalk, and are yellow like unto
gold, fashioned like the flowers of Ranunculus: but bigger, and not whole open,
but abiding half shut: thereafter follow many small coddes together, in the
which the seed lies. The roots are much threddie.

Ranunculus albo flore. Crowfoote with white flowers.


Ranunculus flore globoso. Trol flowers.


The Place.
Crowfoote of the water, grows in ditches and standing waters, sometimes also
in meadows, and low sandy grounds, especially in moist years.





Ranunculus is found upon certain mountains in the Country of Portingal, and
of Civil.





The Time.
The kinds of Crowfootes flower from April til June, and sometimes later.

The Names.
Crowfoote is called in Greek (...): in Latin Ranunculus, of Apuleius Herba
seelerata: in high Douche Hanenfusz: in base Almaigne Hanenvoet, that is to
say, Cocks foot: in French Bassinet: in Spanish Yerua belida: in Italian Pie
Coruino.

The first of the first kind is called of some in Greek (...): in Latin
Apium palustre, and Ranunculus palustris: in French Grenoillette aquatique, or
Bassinet deaue: in high Douch Wasser epffs, and Wasser hanenfusz: in nether
Douchlande Water hanenvoet. It may be called in English Water or Marrish
Crowfoote.

Ranunculus echinatus: in French Grenoillette Herissonnee: in high Douche
Weisz Hanenfusz, Ackerhanenfusz: in Brabant Wit Hanenvoet: in French Bassinet
blanc: in English White Crowfoote, or Vrchin Crowfoote.

Ranunculus auricomus: in French Grenoillette doree: in high Douch Wisen
Hanenfusz, Schwartz Hanenfusz, and Geelb Hanenfusz: in base Almaigne Lupaerts
clawen, and according to the same it is called in Latin Pes Leopardi, that is
to say, Leopardes foot, Crowfoote and Golden Crowfoote.

Herba Sardoa, Apium syluestre, Apium rusticum, Apiastrum, and Apium risus, and
Ranunculus Illyricus, after the Country where it is found. Pass flower, is
called in Latin Pulsatilla, and of some Apium risus: in French Pass fleur:
in high Douche Kuchenschelle: in base Almaigne Cueckenscelle.

Chrisanthemum: in English Golden flower, and now Ranunculus Lusitanicus.

Ranunculus albus: in French Grenoillette petite, ou de Bois: in high Almaigne
Weisz Hanenfusz: in base Almaigne Wit Hanevoet: in English White Crowfoote.

The Nature.
All the Crowfootes be hoate and dry, in the fourth degreee.

The Virtues.






The Danger.
All the Crowfootes are dangerous, and hurtful, yea they kyl and slay,
especially the second, and Apium risus, the which taken inwardly spoyleth the
senses, and understanding, and does so draw together the sinews of the face,
that such as have eaten thereof do seem to laugh, and so they dye laughing,
without some present remedy.

Of Rape Crowfoote. Chap. lxxiij.
The Description.
THis herb is also a kind of Crowfoote, it grows to the length of a span or
twain, the leaves are very much parted and cut, like to the leaves of
Goldknap or Goldecup, the flowers be fair and yellow, the seed grows in
round heads or knoppes, as the seed of Goldcuppes, the root is white and
round as alitle Turnep, sometime of the quantity of a Nut with a beard, or
threddes underneath.

The Place.
This herb grows in dry sandy meadows, and in such like grassie places.

The Time.
It flowereth in April and May.

The Names.
Apuleius calls this herb in Greek (...), and separateth it from the kinds
of Crowfoote called Ranunculus. It is called in Nether Douchlande, Sint
Anthuenis Raepken, that is to say, Saint Anthonies Turnep: we may call it, Rape
Crowfoote, Goldknappe, Yellow Craw.

The Nature, Virtue, and Danger.
This herb is of like quality, and complexion, as the Crowfootes are, and is
as dangerous and hurtful to be taken inwardly.

Batrachion Apulei.


Of Gold Cups / or Gold Knoppes. Chap. lxxiiij.
The Kinds.
GOld knoppe is of two sorts, ye single and double, or else the garden
Goldecuppe, and the wild. The single is the wild kind, ye double is planted in
gardens.

Polyanthemu^ simplex. The single Goldcuppe, or Butter flower.


Polyanthemu^ multiplex. The double Goldcup, Batchelers Buttons.


The Description.
THE Goldeknop has bare slender stemmes, the leaves are blackish, slit and
cloven, not much differing from the leaves of Crowfoote, but more large, and
not so much cut. The flowers be yellow as fine gold, altogether like to golden
Crowfoote. The root is threddie or hearie.

The double Goldcup is like to the single, in his leaves, stalks, and roots,
but the flower is very double. To conclude, Goldknop is very much like
Crowfoote, and especially to the golden kind (which I think to be
Chrysanthemon Constantini Imperatoris) saving that it has no black spots in
the leaves, as golden Crowfoote has, neither is it burning upon the tongue, as
Crowfoote is.

The Place.
Goldeknoppes do grow upon grassie downs or playnes, and in gardens, whereas it
is planted.

The Time.
It flowreth from April, almost all the summer.

The Names.
Pliny calls this herb in Greek (...): and in Latin Polyanthemu^, and it
is described lib. xxvij. Chap. xij. Some do also name it Batrachion, that is to
say, Ranunculus, because it is like the said herb: in French Bassinet* in
high Almaigne Schmalzblum: in base Almaigne Booterbloeme: in English
Goldcuppes, Goldknoppes, and Butterflowers. The double Goldcuppes, are now
calied in English, Bachelors Buttons.

The Nature.
The Goldknop is of complexion hoate and dry, and yet not so hoate as
Ranunculus, or Crowfoote.

The Virtues.
This herb is not used in Physic, yet in some places of Almaigne (as Hierom
Bock writes) they do mingle it amongst other herbs, in round salades, and
Iunkettes with eggs.

Of Anemone. Chap. lxxv.
The Kinds.
DIoscorides describes two kinds of Anemone. The one is tame and the other
wild: of the tame are found many sorts.

The Description.
PAsseflower or the first Anemone, has leaves like Coriander, as witnesses
Dioscorides, or almost like the leaves of Ranunculus, but much lesser. The
flowers be sometimes red, sometimes white, and sometimes purple. The root is
thick and round, greater then an Olyue, in some places not very eue^, but as
though it had certain knottes and joints.

Anemone Passefluer Rosepersley, or Wind Passeflower.


2. Anemone.


3. Anemone.


The second Anemone has leaves like Goldcuppe, but lesser. The flowers be for
the most part blewe, sometimes also white, being beset round about the middle
with xiij. or xiiij. narrow leaves. The root is thick, knottie, and lies
overthwart.

The third Anemone has leaves very much snipt or indented, and flowers of
seven or eight little leaves, of a purple violet color, or red, or white. The
root is much like to the second Anemone.

The fourth Anemone, is like to the third in leaves and roots, but the
flowers are thick, and very double, and red of Color.

The fifth Anemone in leaves is like the aforesaid, but commonly greater. The
flowers are some purple red, some white, and some yellowe. The roots be very
hearic.

The Place.
The first Anemone grows in some places of Almaigne along by the river Reyn.

The fifth grows along by fields, and in wooddes, in low places and
grassie: and is very common in this Country.

The Time.
It flowreth in March and in April.

The Names.
Anemone is also called in Greek (...), and in shoppes likewise: of some Flos
Adonis: and of some Herboristes, Herbaventi, although this name is common unto
other herbs: for as Antonie Musa writes, Cotyledon is likewise called Herba
venti, and also diverse others.

4. Anemone.


5. Anemone.


The Nature.
Anemone is hot and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.


Passum) and after laid upon the eyes, clears the sight, and takes away
webbes and spots.





Of Spereworte or Baneworte. Chap. lxxvi.
The Description.
THis herb has reddish stalks, holow, full of knees or joints, upon the
which grow long narrow leaves, almost like to the Wythie leaves, but yet
longer, and a little snipt or toothed round about, especially those that grow
lowest. The flowers are yellowe as gold, somewhat rough in the middle, in
fashion and color altogether like the flowers of golden Crowfoote. Those being
past, it has knops or heads like the seedie knoppes of golden Crowfoote. The
root is full of threddes or laces.

The Place.
It grows in moist meadows, waterie places, and standing puddelles.

The Time.
It flowreth in May, and soon after yields his seed.

The Names.
This herb is now called in Latin Flammula, that is to say, Flame, or the
fiery herb, because it is very hoate, and burning like fire. The Douchemen
call it Egelcoolen, because ye sheep that have eaten of this herb, have the
disease which they call Egel, that is to say, the inflammation and blistering
of the liver. I know not by what name the old writers have called this herb,
except this be that herb, which Octauius Horatianus does name Cleoma, the
which grows also in moist places, and is of a very hoate temperament or
complexion. It is called in some places of England Sperworte, it may be also
called Banewort.

The Nature and operation.
It is hoate and dry in the fourth degree, and burns, and blistereth the
body, as Ranunculus, unto which it is partly like in complexion and operation.

The Danger.
This herb is hurtful both unto man and beast: for it slays both the one and
the other. The sheep which do happen to eat of it, are vexed with a
marvelous inflammation, and they dye therewith, because their livers are
inflamed and consumed.

Flammula.


Of Herb Paris / or One Berie. Chap. lxxvij.
The Description.
Herb Paris has a smoth round stalk, about a span long, upon the which
grow four leaves, set directly one against another crossewise, or like a
Cross: amongst the said leaves grows a fair starrelike flower, in the
middle whereof there comes forth a bud or knop, growing hard by, and
square, the which turns into a brown berie. The root is long and small,
casting it self hither and thither.

The Place.
This herb grows in dark shadowed wooddes, as in the wood Soignie by
Brussels, where as it grows abundantly.

The Time.
This herb flowreth in April, and the sede is ripe in May.

The Names.
This herb is now called in Latin Herba Paris, and of some Vua Lupina, and
Vua versa: Herba Paris.
in French Raisin de Renard: in high Douche Wolfsbeer, Einbeer: in Nether
Douchlande Wolfsbesie: in English, Herb Paris and One berrie.

The Nature, and Virtues.
The fruit and seed of this herb, are very good against al poison,
especicially for such as by taking of poison, are become peeuishe or without
understanding: insomuche that it heals them, if it be given every morning by
the space of twenty days, as Baptista Sardus has first written, and after
him the excellent learned man Andreas Matthiolus.

Of Aconitum Chap. lxxviij.
The Kinds.
Aconit is of two sorts (as Dioscorides writes) the one is named Aconitum
Pardalianches, that is to say, Aconite that baneth, or kills Panthers. The
other is Aconitum Lycoctonu^, that is to say, Aconit that kills Woolfs,
whereof shall be spoken in the next Chapter.

The Description.
THE first kind of Aconite, called Pardalianches, has three or four leaves,
partly round, and somewhat rough heared, the which do resemble the leaves of
Sow bread, or like the wild Cowcumber, but they be smaller. The stem
grows of the height of spanne. And thereupon grow yellow flowers, which when
they perish, they change into wool hearie threddes, which are carried away
with the wind. By them hangs black seed. The root is not unlike to a
Scorpion, or Tortese, and is white, shining like Alablaster.

Of this kind there is also found an other which is somewhat greater. The
root also is somewhat longer, and more like to a freshwater Creauis. The which
root is most commonly sold of the Apothecaries, for Doronicum.

The Place.
This herb loves shadowie, and rude or wild places, and is not found in
this Country.

Aconitum Pardalianches. Panther, or Leopardes bane.


The Names.
This kind of Aconit, is called in Greek (...): in Latin Aconitum
Pardalianches, Myoctonu^, Theliphonum, Cammorum: in the Apothecaries shoppes,
is this root used for Doronicu^: but it is very unlike to the Doronicum of the
Arabian masters.

The Nature.
Aconit is hoate and dry in the fourth degree, very hurtful to man's nature,
and kills out of hand.

The Virtues.


The Danger.
Aconit taken into the body, kills Wolves, Swine, and all beasts both wild
and tame.

Of Woolfes bane / or Leopardes bane. Chap. lxxix.
The Kinds.
VVOolfes bane is of two sorts. The one bears blewe flowers, and the other
yellowe. And of both those kinds are diverse other.

Lycoctonum caeruleum maius, Napellus verus. Blew Woolfs bane, or Monks Hoode.


Lycoctonum caeruleum minus.


The Description.


Lycoctonum Ponticum. Pontike Leopardes bayne, or yellow Woolfes bayne.


Lycoctonum flore Delphini.


The great blewe Woolfs bayne, has likewise large leaves, and cloven or cut,
not much differing from the aforesaid, but much greater and more finely
iagged and cut, and in color likewise brown. The stalks grow to the height
of three or four foot, and they bear at the top fair blewe flowers, rough
within, and made like a Hoode or Helmet, of five leaves: whereof the two
neathermost are narrow and straight, they of each side a little larger, and
the leaf that is all vpmost is great and holowe, as a Cappe or Hoode, covering
the leaves that are by the sides. In the holownesse of the said flower, grow
two small crooked hears, somewhat great at the end, fashioned like a fools
babble: in the middle of the said flowers are many small hearie threddes, at the
end of the said small threddes, are little pricks or points, turning upon
yellowe. When the flowers do fall, there come in their steed, three or four
husks together, having a hard, black, and cornered seed. The root is
thick and black, fashioned like a pear, and has many hearie stringes or
strappes.

To these kinds of blewe Woolfes bayne, is likewise accounted another purple
flower, the leaves be much cut, the flowers grow along the stalks, and are of
a violet color, of fashion like unto a Knights Spur, with a little tail
hanging behind the flower. The coddes are as the aforesaid. The roots are
joining three or four together.

The yellow Woolfes bayne, is likewise of two sorts, the one great, and the
other small. The great yellowe Woolfes bane, has large blackishe leaves,
slitte and cloven, almost like to Crowfoote, but far greater. The stemmes be
roundishe, about two foot high or more: at the top of those stemmes or
branches grow pale flowers, almost like the flowers of wild Lineseede, after
which flowers there follow small coddes, containing a black and cornered seed.
The root is black and very threddy.

The little yellowe Woolfes bane is a lower herb, his leaves come forth of the
root, the which are deeply cut round about: the flowers grow upon some of
the leaves, and they be of a yellowe color, fashioned like unto one of the
Ranunculus flowers. Thereafter follow coddes like unto the Woolfes bane. The
roots be thick and knotty as on the Anemone.

The Place.
These venomous and noughtie herbs are found in this Country planted in the
gardens of certain Herboristes, and the blew is very common in diverse gardens.
The two last kinds are found in Almaigne and other Countries, in low
valleys, and dark wooddes or wild forestes. The yellowe are also found upon
wild mountains in dark places.

The Time.
These herbs do flower in April, May, and June.

The Names.
This herb is in called in Greek (...): in Latin Aconitum lycoctonum and of
some Luparia: in French Tueloup.

Cucullus Monachi, or Cappa Monachi, that is to say, The Cape or Hoode of the
Monk: and the second is counted of many learned men to be the right or true
Napellus described of Auicen, and he calls it Napellus, quasi paruus Napus,
because the root is like to a little Rape or Nauew, called in Latin Napus.

Lycoctonum Ponticum: in French Tueloup iaulne: in high Douche Wolffwurtz, and
Gelbwolffwurtz: in Nether Douchlande Geel Wolf wortell: in English Yellowe
Woolfes bane: plain Woolfes bane, and Heath Crowfoote.

The little yellowe seems well to be that Aconitum, the which Theophrastus
has spoken of, and is now called of some Aconitum hyemale: because it is
preserved in the gardens of this Country, and in the winter it flowreth.

The Nature.
All these Leopardes or Woolfes bane, are hoate and dry in the fourth degree,
and of a venomous quality.

The Danger.
Woolfes bane taken into the body, inflameth the heart, burns the inward
parts, and kills the body, as it has been seen not long since, in
Anwarpe, where as some did eat in Salade the root of blewe Woolfes bane, in
steed of some other good herb, and died incontinent. The kinds of Woolfes
bane, do not only kill men, but also Woolfes, Dogs, and such other beasts,
if it be given them to eat with flesh.

Of Oleander / or Rose Baye. Chap. lxxx.
The Description.
OLeander is a little tree or shrub, bearing leaves greater, thicker, and
rougher, then the leaves of the Almonde tree, the flowers be of a fair red
color, divided into five leaves, and not much unlike a little Rose. The fruit
is as long as a finger, full of rough hearie seed, like the coddes or husks
of Asclepias, called in English Swallowe wort.

The Place.
Oleander grows in some Countries by rivers, and the sea side, in pleasant
places (as Dioscorides writes) in this Country in the gardens of some
Herboristes.

Nerium.


The Time.
In this Country it brings forth his flower in June.

The Names.
This plant is called in Greek (...): Nicander calls it also Neris: in
Latin Laurus rosea, and Rosea arbor: that is to say, Rose tree: in Shoppes
Oleander: in French Rosagine, or Rosage: in Douche Oleander boom: in English
Rose tree, or Rose Baye tree, Oleander, and Nerium.

Nerium.


The Nature.
Oleander is also very hoate and dry of Complexion.

The Virtues.
It has scarce one good property. It may be compared to a Pharisee, who
makes a glorious and beautiful show, but inwardly is of a corrupt and
poisoned nature. God grant all true Christians and Christian Realms, whereas
this tree, or any branche thereof, begins to spread and fiorishe, to put to
their helping hands to destroy it, and all the branches thereof: as
dissimulation, Covetousness, Briberie, sir Symonie, and master Usury. It is
high time, if it be the will of God, to supplant it. For it has already flowred,
so that I fear it will shortly seed, and fill this wholesome soil full of wicked
Nerium.

The Danger.
Oleander or Nerium, is very hurtful to man, but most of all to Sheep,
Goats, Kine, Dogs, Asses, Mules, Horses, and al four footed beasts: for it
is deadly, and kills them. Yea if they do but drink the water, wherein
Oleander has been stieped or soked, it causes them to dye suddenly, as
Dioscorides, Pliny, and Galen do write.

Of Poppie. Chap. lxxxi.
The Kinds.
THere be three sorts of Poppie, as Dioscorides says, whereof the first kind
is white, and of the garden, the two other are black and wild.

Papauer satiuum. Garden Poppie.


Papauer syluestre. Wild Poppie.


The Description.










There droppeth or runs out of Poppie, a liquor as white as milk, when the
heads be pierced or hurt, the which is called Opium, and men gather and dry
it, and is kept of the Apothecaries in their shoppes to serve in medicine.

The Place.
Al these kinds of Poppie are sown in this Country in gardens. The third
kind is very common, insomuch as it is sown in many feelds for the commodity
and profit which comes of the seed. In Apulia and Spain, and other hoate
Countries, they gather the juice, which is the Opium, that men of this
Country put in medicines.

The Time.
It flowreth most commonly in June.

The Names.
Poppie is called in Greek (...): in Latin and in shoppes Papauer, of some
Oxytonon, Prosopon, Lethe, Lethusa, and Onitron: in high Almaigne, Magsamen,
Moen, Magle, and Olmag: in base Almaigne Huel, and of some Mancop.

The juice of Poppie is called in Greek (...): in Latin, and in shoppes Opium.

Papauer satiuum, of some Thylacitis: in shoppes Papaueralbum: in French Pauot
cultiue and blanc: in Almaigne Witten Huel, and Tammen Huel: in English White
Poppie, and Garden Poppie.

Papauer syluestre, and erraticum, some also call it Pithitis: in Shoppes
Papauer nigrum, magnum, of the unlearned Papauer rubrum, and according to the
same, the Frenchmen call it Pauot rouge: in Douche Rooden Huel: in English,
Black Poppie, and Wild Poppie.

Papauer commune, and Papauer nigrum, that is to say, Common Poppie, and black
Poppie: in Douche Huel. This should seem to be Poppie Rhoeas, that is to say,
Flowing and falling, because the seed thereof flows out when it is ripe,
which chances to none of the other kinds, as is abouesayde.

The Nature.
All the Poppies be cold and dry, almost even hard to the fourth degree.

Opium is cold and dry, almost hard to the fourth degree.

The Virtues.






Ignis sacer, and hoate tumors, which have need of cooling.

Opium, that is the juice of Poppie dried, taken in quantity of a fetch,
swageth all inward pains, causes sleep, cures the cough, and stops the
flixe.



Erysipelas, or Wild fire, and all other inflammations, and with woman's milk
and Saffron, it swageth the pain of the gowte.



Opium be taken, either inwardly or outwardly, it causes sleep, and takes
away pains. Yet ye must take heed, to use it ever with discretion.

The Danger.
The use of Poppie is very evil and dangerous, and especially Opium, the which
taken excessiuely, or to often applied upon the flesh outwardly, or otherwise
without good consideration and aduisement, it will cause a man to sleep to
much, as though he had the Lethargy, which is the forgetful sickness, and
brings foolish and doting fancies, it corrupts the sense and understanding,
brings the Palsy, and in fine it kills the body.

The Correction.
When by great necessity ye are forced to use Opium, mix Saffron with it, for
it shall let, and somewhat hinder the evil quality of Opium, in such sort as
it shall not so easily do harm, as it would, if Saffron were not mingled with
it. See Turners Herbal for the remedy against Opium lib. 2 fol. 76.

Of Red Poppie / or Cornerose. Chap. lxxxij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of red Poppie, or Cornerose, the great and the small,
differing only in leaves, but the flowers are like one another.

The Description.
THE small Cornerose, or wild Poppie, has small rough branches, the leaves be
somewhat long, toothed round about, not much differing from the leaves of the
other Poppie, saving that they be much smaller, and not smothe, but rough. The
flowers be of a fair red color, not differing in figure from the flowers of
the other Poppie with black threads in the middle. After the falling of the
flowers, there rise heads much smaller then the heads of Poppie, and in
proportion longer, wherein is contained black seed. The root is long and
yellowish.

Papauer Rhoeas. Shadowie Poppie, or red Poppie.


Papauer Rhoeas alterum. Cornerose or shadding Poppie.




The Place.
The Cornerose grows amongst the Wheat, Rye, Otes, and Barley. The least is
most common.

The Time.
Cornerose flowreth in May, and from that time forth, until the end of
summer.

The Names.
This kind of wild Poppie is called in Greek (...): in Latin Papauer
erraticum, Papauer fluidum, and Papauer Rhoeas: in some Shoppes Papauer rubrum:
in French Coquelicoc, or Ponceau: in high Douch Klapperrosen, Kornrosen: In
base Almaigne Clapperroosen, and Rooden Huel, or wilden Huel. And it is not
without cause to be doubted, whether the second Cornerose be a kind of (...),
Argemone, or no.

The Nature.
Corneroses do cool and refreshe also, and are of complexion much like Poppie.





Of Horned or Codded Poppie. Chap. lxxxiij. And Hypocoum forte.
Papauer Corniculatum. Horned Poppie, yellow Poppie.


Papaueris corniculati alia species. Horned Poppie, an other kind.


The Description.


There is yet two other sorts of this Poppie, as some men of good knowledge do
testify, the which are very common in Spain.

saving that his flowers be not yellowe, but shining red: but for the rest, the
flower is agreeable with the proportion of the yellow.





Corniculati Papaueris peregrina species. A strange codded Poppie.


The Place.








The Time.
Horned Poppie flowreth in July and August.

Hypecoum flowreth in April, and the seed is ripe in June.

The Names.
This kind of Poppie is called in Greek (...): in Latin Papauer cornutum,
and of some Apothecaries that are ignorant Memitha, whereunto it is nothing
like: in French Pauot cornu: in high Douche Gehornter Magsamen, and Geel
Olmagen: in base Almagne Geelen Huel: in English Horned Poppie.

Some of the learned sort do think, that this herb is a kind of Papauer
Corniculatum, that is to say, Horned Poppie, described by Dioscorides in his
fourth book. Some would have it Papauer spumeum, described of the same
Dioscorides in the same place. But if it may be lawful for me to give a
judgment as well as the rest, it shall be neither of those herbs: but rather that
Hypecoum of Dioscorides, named in Greek (...), and (...) for all the signs and
tokens do agree very well with the same.

The Nature.
Horned Poppie is hoate and dry in the third degree.

If the fourth kind be Hypecoum, it should be cold and dry in the third
degree, not much differing from Poppie, as Galen says.

The Virtues.






Of Maudrake / or Mandrage. Chap. lxxxiiij.
The Kinds.
MAndrake (as Dioscorides writes) is of two sorts, that is to say, The white
and the black. The white is called ye male Mandrake, the which is very well
known. The black is called the female Mandrage, the which is not yet much
known.

The Description.
THe white Mandrake has great large leaves, of a whitish green color,
thick, and plain, spread upon the ground, not much differing from the leaves
of Beetes, amongst the which there comes up, upon short small and smooth
stemmes, fair, yellowe, round apples, and of a strong savor, but yet not
unpleasant. The root is great and white, not much unlike a Radishe root,
divided into two or three parts, and sometimes growing one upon another,
almost like the thighs and legs of a man.

The black or female Mandrake, has likewise no upright stem, his leaves be
in like manner spread abroad upon the ground, narrower and smaller then the
leaves of lettise, of an unpleasant smell or savor. The apples be pale, in
figure like the Sorbappel or Corme, by half less then the apples of the
Malemandrage. The root is black without, and white within, cloven beneth into
two or three divisions or cliftes folding one upon another. It is smaller then
the root of the male.

Mandragora mas. The male Mandrake. Mandragora foemina. The female Mandrake.


The Place.
Mandrage growth willingly in dark and shadowie places. It grows not of him
self in this Country, but ye shall find it in the gardens of some
Herboristes, the which do set it in the soune.

The Time.
The Apples of Mandrage, in this Country be ripe in August.

The Names.
Mandrage is called in Greek (...): in Latin Mandragoras, of some Circaea,
and Antimalum, and of Pythagoras also Anthropomorphos, because that the roots
of this herb are like to the lower parts of man.

Mandragoras mas, of some (as Dioscorides says) Morion: in French Mandragore
masle: in high Douch Alraun mennlin: in Nether Douchlande Mandragora manneken,
or Alruyn manneken: in English White Mandrake, and Male Mandrage.

Mandragoras foemina, of some Thridacias: in French Mandragore femelle: in
Almaigne Alraun weibling, and Mandragora wijfken: in English Black Mandrake,
and Female Mandrage.

The Nature.
The root of Mandrake, and especially the bark, is cold and dry even hard
to the fourth degree, the fruit is not so cold, and it has some moisture
adjoining.

The Virtues.














The Danger.
It is most dangerous to receive into the body, the juice of the root of this
herb, for if one take never so little more in quantity, then the just
proportion which heought to take, it kills the body. The leaves and fruit, be
also dangerous, for they cause deadly sleep, and peevish drowsines like Opium.
See Turners remedy against this evil in the Chapter of Mandrage.

Of Mad Apples / or Rage Apples. Chap. lxxxv.
The Kinds.
There be two kinds of Amorus, or Raging love apples. The one bears apples
of a purple color, the other pale of whitishe, in all things else one like to
the other, as in making, fashion, stalks, leaves, and flowers.

The Description.
THis plant has a round stalk or stem of a foot high, bearing broad
brown green leaves, almost like to ye leaves of Dwale or deadly Nightshade,
but a little more rougher, amongst the which grow the flowers upon short
stemmes, which do turn afterward into a great, round, long fruit, almost
like an apple, full of seed within as the Cowcumber, and of color outwardly
sometimes brown as a Chestnut, sometimes white, or yellow. The root is full of
laces like threddes.

The Place.
Apples of love, grow not of their own kind in this Country: but the
Herboristes do set and mainteyne them in their gardens, as Cowcumbers and
Gourdes, with the which they do spring, and vanish yearly.

The Time.
This plant flowreth in August, and his fruit is ripe in September.

Mala insana.


The Names.
They be called now in Latin Mala insana: in French Pommes D'amours: in base
Almaigne, Verangenes: in high Douche, according to the Latin name Melantzan,
and Doll opffel, that is to say, Raging or mad Apples, also they be called in
English Amorus Apples, and Apples of love.

The Nature.
These apples be of complexion cold and moist like Gourdes.

The Virtues.


Of Amorus Apples or Golden Apples. Chap. lxxxvi.
The Kinds.
THese strange Apples be also of two sorts, one red, and the other yellowe,
but in all other points they be like as in stalks, leaves, and growing.

The Description.
THese apples have round stalks of a gray or ash color, and hearie: three
or four foot long full of branches. The leaves be great, broad, and long,
spread abroad upon every side, and deeply cut, almost like the leaves of
Aygremonie, but much greater and whiter. The flowers are yellowishe, growing
upon short stemmes, five or six together, and when they are fallen, there come
in their places great flat apples, bollen or by certain spaces bunched out,
on the sides, and of color sometimes red, sometimes white, and sometimes
yellowe, like Ore^ges, or Mandrake apples, wherein is contained the seed. All the herb is of a strange stinking savor, and it must be sown every year as
the Cowcombers be.

The Place.
This is a strange plant, and not found in this Country, except in the
gardens of some Herboristes, where as it is sown.

The Time.
This herb flowreth in July and August, his apples be ripe in August and
September.

The Names.
This strange plant, is now called in Latin Pomum Amoris, Poma Amoris, and
of some Pomumaureum: in French Pommes dorees, and of some also Pommes
D'amours: in high Douche Golt offel: in base Almaigne Gulden appelen: in
English Apples of love, or Golden Apples.

Poma Amoris.


The Nature and Virtue.
The complexion, nature, and working of this plant, is not yet known, but by
that I can gather of the taste, it should be cold of nature, especially the
leaves, somewhat like unto Mandrake, and therefore also it is dangerous to be
used.

Of Apples of Perome. Chap. lxxxvij.
The Description.
THE apple of Perow has a round stalk, about two foot long, the leaves be
grayishe, almost like the leaves of Solanum, or Nightshade, but greater,
especially ye lowmost next the root, the flowers be white, round, and holowe
as a bell, of a pleasant savor like the white Lilie, and when they are fallen,
there comes fruit, round as an apple, of a green color, beset round
about with many prickley thorns, and therefore they call it Thorn apple, full
of seed within like the Apples of love. The root is full of threddie stringes,
interlaced, wouen, and winded one in another.

The Place.
The apple of Perow, is a stranger also, the which is not to be found except
in the gardens of the Herboristes, and yet not often.

The Time.
These apples are in flower, in May and June.

The Names.
This strange plant is called of the Italians, Stramonia, and Pomum spinosum,
of some Corona regia: at Venize Melospinus, and Paracoculi: in French Pomme de
Perou, or Pomme espineuse: in high Douche Stech opffel, Rauch opffel, and
Stecheud opffel: in base Almaigne Doren appel: we may call it in English, The
apple of Perrow, Thornie apples, Prickle apples, and Stramonia.

The Nature.
The complexion, virtue, and faculty of this plant, is not yet known.

Of the Balm Apple or Momordica. Chap. lxxxviij.
The Kinds.
BY the name of Balsamine, you must now understand two sorts of apples, or
fruits, varying much one from an other, both in figure and growing. The one
is called the Male Balsem, or Balm apple. The other is called the female
Balsem apple.

Stramonia.


The Description.




Charantia. Balsam apple, the male. Marvelous apples.


Balsaminum. Balsam the Femal.


The Place.
These two strange herbs, are found in this Country, in the gardens of
certain Herboristes.

The Time.
These plants do flower in July and August, and their fruit is ripe in August
and September.

The Names.
The first kind of these herbs is called in Italian Charantia, Balsamina,
Momordica, and in some places, Pomum Hierosolymitanum: in French Pomum
mirabile, Pomme de merueille, and Merueille masle: in high Douch Balsam opffel
mennlin: in base Almaigne Balsam appel manneken: in English we may call it
Momordica, and the Male Balsam apple.

The other kind is called Balsaminum, and is not Charantia, Balsamina, or
Momordica, as some do think. The high Douchmen do call it Balsam opffel
weiblin, that is to say, Merueille femelle: and in base Almaigne, Balsem appel
wijfken: in English, the female Balsam apple.

The Nature.
The complexion of these apples, according to the judgment of some, is hoate
in the first degree, and dry in the second.

The Virtues.






















Of Nightshade or Morelle. Chap. lxxxix.
The Description.
NIghtshade has round stalks of a foot long, full of branches. The leaves
are blackishe, large, soft, and full of juice, like to the leaves of Basil, but
much greater: the little flowers be white, hanging three or four one by
another. After that they be passed, there come in their places, berries hanging
together like the fruit of Iuie, of color most commonly black, when they be
ripe sometimes red, and sometimes also yellow. The root is white and full of
heary threddes.

The Place.
Nightshade is very common in this Country, about old walls, under hedges,
about paths, and hollow ways, and al about the borders of feeldes, and in the
gardens of pot herbs.

The Time.
This herb flowreth from the month of June, during all the summer, and in
this space delivers his seed.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Solanum, and Solanum horrense:
In Shoppes Solatrum, and of some Morella, Vua lupina, and Vua Vulpis: in
French Morelle: in high Douche Nachtschat: in base Almaigne Nascaye, and
Nachtscade: in English Nightshade, Petimorel, and Morel.

The Nature.
Morell is cold and dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.




Parotidas, if it be laid thereunto after the form of a plaster.





Solanum hortense.




Of sied Nightshade / Winter Cherrie and Alcakengy. Chap. xc.
The Description.




Vesicaria vulgaris. Alcakengie or winter Cherie.


Vesicaria peregrina. Black winter Cherie.


The Place.
Alcakengie grows in some wooddes of this Country, about hedges and low
moist places, and is much planted in gardens.

The Time.
The little bladders, and the fruit of this plant are ripe in August and
September.

The Names.
Vesicaria, of Pliny Vesicula, of some Callion, in Shoppes Alkakengie: in
French Alquequanges, and des Coquerelles: in high Douche Schlutten, Boberellen,
Iuden Kirszen, Teuffels Kirsen, Iuden Hutlin, and Rot Nachtschad: in base
Almaigne, Criecken van ouersee, That is to say, Beyondsea Cheries: in English
it is called Nightshade, Alkakengie, and Winter Cheries.

Vesicaria peregrina, and Vesicaria nigra: in French Pois de merueilles: in
high Douch Munchs copfflin, Schwarte Schlutten, and Welsch Schlutten: in base
Almaigne Vremde Criecken van over zea, and Swerte Criecken van over zea.

The Nature.
The leaves of Alkakengie are cold like Petimorell. The fruit is not so
cold. Moreover, it is of subtle parts.

The complexion of the strange Alkakengie, is yet unknown.

The Virtues.




Of great Nightshade / or Dwale. Chap. xci.
The Description.
THis noughtie and deadly plant is taken for a kind of Solanum, because it
does somewhat resemble it. It has round blackish stalks of two or three foot
high, or more, upon the which grow great broad leaves, somewhat rough,
greater and larger, yea and blacker then the leaves of Morel, the flowers be of
a brown color, fashioned like to little holow belles, after the which there
comme up great round beries, every one upon a stalk by him self, about the
bigness of a Cherie, green at the beginning, but afterward when they wax
toward rypenesse, they be of a fair black shining color, within the said
beries is contained a little brown seed. The root is great, putting forth
new every year, and bringing forth a number of new stalks.

The Place.
This herb is found in some places of this Country, in woods, and hedges,
and in the gardens of some Herboristes.

The Time.
The fruit or beries of this venomous Solanum, are ripe in August.

Mandragoras Theophrasti. Solanum lethale.


The Names.
This herb is now called Solanum lethale: in Shoppes Solatrum mortale: in
French Solanum mortel: in high Douche Dollkraut, Seukraut: in base Almaigne
Groote Nascaye, and Dulcruyt, or Dulle besien. This is not Solanum Manicum,
neither Solanum Somniferum, neither yet Mandragoras Morion, the which
Dioscorides describes. But it should rather seem to be that kind of
Mandrage, whereof Theophrast speaks in his sixth book the second Chapter.
And for that cause it may be well called Mandragoras Theophrasti.

The Nature.
The leaves and fruit of this herb are very cold, even in the fourth degree.

The working.
The green and fresh leaves of this deadly Nightshade, may be applied
outwardly as the leaves of Petimorel to S. Antonies fire, and the like hoate
inflammations but it must be done by great advise, seeing that this Solanum
cools again more strongly than the common Nightshade.

The mischeuous Danger.
Solanum is deadly, and brings such as have eaten thereof into a deep sleep,
with rage and anger, the which passion leaves them not, until they die, as it
has been seen by experience, as well in Almaigne, as at Mechlen, upon some
children who have eaten of this fruit, thincking that it was not hurtful.
Wherefore each man ought to take heed, that they plant not, neither yet suffer
in their gardens, any such venomous herbs, especially of such sorts which
bear a fair and pleasant fruit, as this last recited kind does: or if they
will have it in their gardens, then at the least way, they ought to be careful,
to see to it, and to close it in, that no body enter into the place where it
grows, that will be entised with the beauty of the fruit to eat thereof, as
it comes very oftentimes to pass unto women and young children.

Of Solanum Somniferum, and Manicum. Chap. xcij.
Sleeping Nightshade. Furious Nightshade.
The Kinds.
THE dealy Nightshade, whereof I have written in the former Chapter, causes me
yet to remember two other kinds of Solanum, or Morel, described of the
Ancientes, and of Dioscorides. Whereof one is called Solanum Somniferum, that
is to say, Sleeping Nightshade: The other is called Solanu^ Manicum, that is to
say, Mad, or Raging Nightshade.

The Description.
SOlanum Somniferum, that is, Sleeping Nightshade, has gross and hard
stalks, upon the which grows great broad leaves, almost like to the leaves
of the Quince tree. The flower is great and red, the fruit as yellowe as
Saffron, contained in puffed balls or coddes. The root is long and woody,
and on the outside brown.

The other Solanum called Manicum, that is to say, Mad or Raging, has leaves
like Senuie or Mostarde, but greater, and somewhat like to the leaves of the
right Branke Vrsine, called in Latin Acanthus, the which shall be described in
the fifth book. It brings forth from one root ten or twelve stalks of the
height of two or three foot, at the top of the said stalks or branches
grows a round head of the bigness of an Olyue, and rough like the fruit of
the Plane tree, but smaller and longer. The flower is black, and when it
perishes, it brings forth a little grape, with ten or twelve beries, like
the fruit of Iuie, but playner, and smother like the berries of grapes. The
root is white and thick of a cubite long, and holow within. To this
Description agrees that kind of strange Mallowe, which is called Malua
Theophrasti, and Alcea Veneta, the which shall be described in the xxvij.
Chapter of the fifth part of this History.

The Place.
Solanum Somniferum, according to the opinion of Dioscorides, grows in stony
places, lying not far from the Sea.

Solanum Manicum, grows upon high hills, whose situation or standing is
against the Son.

The Names.
The first kind of these two herbs, is called in Greek (...): in Latin
Solanum Somniferum, that is to say in English, Sleeping Nightshade, of some
Halicacabon, Dircion, Apollinaris minor, Vlticana herba, and Opsago.

The second kind is called in Greek (...): in Latin Solanum Manicum: that is
to say, Furious or raging Solanum, or Nightshade, of some Persion, Thryon,
Anydron, Pentadryon, and Enoron.

The Nature.
The sleeping Nightshade or Solanum, is cold in the third degree, approaching
very near unto the nature or complexion of Opium, but much weaker.

The root of ye mad or furious Solanum or Nightshade, especially the bark
thereof, is dry in the third degree, and cold in the second, as Galen
writes.

The Virtues.
Solanum Somniferum, causes one to make water, and is very good against the
Dropsy, but ye may not take above twelve of the beries at once: for if you
take more, they will do harm.





Solanum, especially the bark thereof, is very good to be rubbed and laid to
Saint Antonies fire, in form of a plaster, and upon ulcers that be corrupt
and filthy.

Solanum inwardly.

The Danger.
If you give more then twelve of the beries or grapes of Solanum Somniferum, it
will cause such as you do give it unto, to rave, and wax distracte or
furious, almost as much as Opium.

The root of Solanum Manicum, taken in wine to the quantity of a Dram,
causes idle and vain imaginations: and taken to the quantity of two Drams,
it brings frenzy and madness, which lasts by the space of three or four
days: and if four Drammes thereof be taken, it kills.

Of Henbane. Chap. xciij.
The Kinds.
Of Henbane are three kinds (as Dioscorides and others have written) that is,
the black, the yellowe, and the white.

The Description.
THE black Henbane has great stalks and soft, the leaves be great broad,
soft, gentle, woolly, grayishe, cut and iagged, especially those at the lowest
part of the stalk, and near the root: for they that grow upon branches, are
smaller, narrower and sharper. The flowers be browneblewe within, and like to
little belles, and when they fall of, there follow round husks, like little
pottes, covered with small couers, enclosed within with small rough velmes or
skins, open above, and having five or six sharp points. These pottes or
cups are set in a rewe, one after another, along the stalks. Within the
said pottes is contained a brown sede. The root is long, sometimes as great,
as a finger.

The yellowe Henbane has broad whitishe and soft, or gentle leaves, neither
carved nor cut, almost like the leaves of Mortal Nightshade, but greater,
whiter, and softer. The flowers be of a feynt or pale yellow color, and round,
the which being past, there come in their steed round husks, almost like
little cups, not much differing from the cups or husks of black Henbane,
wherein is the seed, which is like to the seed of other Henbanes. These small
pottes do grow and are enclosed in a round skin, but the same is gentle and
pricketh not. The root is tender. This kind of Henbane, having once borne his
seed, dies before winter, and it must be sown yearly.

Hyoscyamus niger. Black Henbane.


Hyoscyamus luteus. Yellowe Henbane.


Hyoscyamus albus White Henbane.




The Place.
The Henbane does grow very plenteously in this Country, about ways and
paths, and in rought and sandy places.

The two other kinds, ye Herboristes do set in their gardens, whereof ye white
sort grows of his own kind, as Dioscorides says, upon dunge heaps, or
mixens by the sea coast. In Languedoc they have scarce any other, saving the
white kind.

The Time.
These three kinds of Henbane do flower in July and August.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Hyoscyamus, Apollinaris, and
Faba suilla, of some Dioscyamos, that is, Iouis faba, Fabulonia: of Apuleia
Symphoniaca, Calicularis, Remenia, Faba Lupina, Mania: of the ancient
Romans, and Hetruscians, or Tuscans, Fabulum: of the Arabian Physicians
Altercum, and Altercangenum: of Mattheus Syluaticus, Deus Caballinus, and
Cassilago: of Iacobus Manlius Herba Pinula: of some others Canicularis, and
Caniculata: in French Iusquiame, or Hanebane: in high Almaigne Bilsamkraut,
Sewbon, and Dolkraut: in nether Douchlande Bilsen, and Bilsencruyt.

The first kind is called because of his darkish brown flowers, Hyosyamus
niger, that is to say, black Henbane.

The second is called Hyoscyamus luteus, that is to say, Yellowe Henbane,
because it bears yellow flowers.

The third which has white flowers, is called Hyoscyamus albus, that is to
say, White Henbane.

The Choice.
The white Henbane is best to be used in medicine. The two other be not so
good, especially the black which is most hurtful.

The Nature.
The seed of the white Henbane, and the leaves are cold in the third degree.
The two other kinds are yet more colder, almost in the fourth degree, very
hurtful to the nature of mankind.

The Virtues.














Opium, Henbane, Hemlocke, and such other, the disease or pain is not clean
taken away, but the body and grieved place is but only astonished, or made a
sleep for a season, and by this means it feels no pain. But when they come
again to their feeling, the pain is most commonly more grievous then before,
and the disease more harder to be cured, by the extreme cooling of the said
herbs, which bring to the sick (especially to such as be of a cold nature)
intolerable Crampes and retractions of smewes. Therefore these herbs ought not
to be used for the appeasing of pain, except in time of great need when the
grief is great and intolerable.

The Danger.




Of Hemlocke. Chap. xciiij.
The Description.
HEmlocke has a high long stalk, of five or six foot long, great and
hollow, full of joints like the stalks of fenil, of an herbelike color,
poudered with small read spots, almost like the stem of Dragon, or the
greater Serpentarie. The leaves be great, thick, and small cut, almost like
the leaves of Cheruil, but much greater, and of a strong unpleasant savor. The
flowers be white, growing by tuftes, or spokie tops, the which do change and
turn into a white flat seed. The root is short, and somewhat holowe within.

The Place.
This noughtie and dangerous herb, grows in places not toyled, under hedges,
and about pales, and in the fresh, cold shadow.

The Time.
Hemlocke flowreth most commonly in July.

Cicuta.


The Names.
This herb is called in greek (...): in Latin Cicuta: in English Hemlocke: in
French Cigne: in high Almaigne Shirling, Wutzerling, wundtscherling, and
Weterich: in base Almaigne, Scheerlinck, and Duile keruel, or Dulle Peterselie:
of some unlearned Apothecaries Harmel, the which albeit they have been sundry
times warned of their errors by many learned, as Leonicenus, Manardus, and
diverse others, yet will they not leave, but continue obstinate in in their
ignorance, using yet daily in steed of the seed of Rue called in Greek
Harmel, the seed of Hemlocke (the which they take peruersly for Harmel) and
do put it daily into their Medicines.

The Nature.
Hemlocke is very cold, almost in the fourth degree.

The Virtues.


Opium does.

The Danger.
Hemlocke is very evil, dangerous, hurtful, and venomous, in so much that
whosoever takes of it, dies, except he drink good old wine after it: for
the drinking of such wine, after the receiving of Hemlocke, does surmount and
overcome the poison, and heals the person: but if one take the wine and
Hemlocke together, the strength of the poison is augmented, and then it kills
out of hand, insomuche that he is no kind of ways to be helped, that has
taken Hemlocke with wine.

The end of the third part of the History of Plants.
The fourth part of the History of Plants / treating of the sundry Kinds /
fashions / names / virtues, and operations, of Corn or Grain, Pulse,
Thistelles, and such like.
By Rembertus Dodonaeus.
Of Wheat. Chap. i.
The Kinds.
THE Ancient writers have described diverse sorts of wheat, according to the
places and Countries, from whence it has been brought to Rome and other such
great Cities. But such as make no account of so many kinds, as Columella and
Pliny, have divided wheat but only into three kinds: whereof the one is
called Robus, the other Siligo. The which twain are winter corn or fruits,
and the third Setanium, which is a summer wheat or grain. Yet to say the
truth, this is as it were but one sort or kind, and the diversity consists
but only in this point, that the one kind is browner or blacker, and the
other sort is whiter and fairer, and the one is to be sown before winter, and
the other after.

The Description.
EVery kind of wheat has a round high stem, straw, or reed, most
commonly many strawes growing from one root, every one having three or four
joints, or knottes, greater and longer then barley straw, covered with two or
three narrow leaves, or grayishe blades, at the highest of the said stem or
straw, a good way from the said leaves, or blades, grows the ear, in which
the grain or corn is set, without order, very thick, and not bearded.

The Place.
The wheat grows in this Country, in the beast and fruitful feeldes.

The Time.
Men sow their winter corn in September, or October, and the summer corn in
March, but they are ripe altogether in July.

The Names.
Wheat is called in Greek (...): in Latin Triticum: in high Douche Weyssen,
and Weytzen: in nether Douchlande Terwe.

Robus, and of Pliny Triticu^: in English Red Wheat.

Triticum. Wheat.


Siligo, and that is our common wheat growing in this Country, as we have
evidently declared in Latin, in Historia Frugu^, whereas we have also declared,
that our common Rye is not Siligo, whereof Columel and Pliny have written.

Setanium, and Trimestre Triticum: in French Ble de Mars: in base Almaigne,
Zoomer Terwe: in English March, or summer Wheat.

Wheat laid to outwardly as a medicine, is hoate in the first degree, without
any manifest moisture. But the bread that is made thereof, is warmer, and has a
greater force, to ripe, draw, and digest.

The Amylum made of wheat, is cold and dry, and somewhat astringent.

The Virtues.


Sextus Pompeius, who being so used, was cured of the gowte.





















Amylum or Starche, that is made of wheat, is good against the falling down
of rheumes and humors into the eyes, if it be laid thereunto, and it cures
and fills again with flesh, wounds and holow ulcers.

Amylum dronken stops the spetting of blood, and mingled with milk, it
swageth the roughness, or soreness of the throat and breast, and causes to
spet out easyly.

Of the Corn called Spelt or Seia. Chap. ij.
The Kinds.
SPelt is of two sorts. The one has commonly two corns or seeds joined
together, whereof each grain is in his own skin, or chaffie covering. The
other is single, and has but one grain.

The Description.
SPelt, has straw, joints, and ears, much like to wheat, saving that the
corn thereof is not bare as the wheat corn is, but is enclosed in a little
skin or chaffie husk, from which it can not be easily purged, or cleansed,
except in the myll, or some other devise made for the same purpose, and when it
is so pylde and made clean from the chafe, it is very wellyke to a wheat
corn, both in proportion and Nature: in so much that at the end of three
years, the Spelt being so purged, changes it self into fair wheat, when it
is sown, as Pliny, Theophraste, and diverse other of the Auncientes have
written.

The Place.
Spelt requires a fat and fruitful ground well labored, and grows in high
and open feeldes. In times past, it was found only in Greece, but at this day,
it grows in many places of Italy, France, and Flaunders.

The Time.
It is sown in September, and October, like unto wheat, and is ripe in July.

The Names.
This grain is called in Greek (...): in Latin Zea: of the Ancient Romans
Semen, and Far, and at this day Spelta: in French Espeautre: in high Douche
Speltz, and Dinckelkorne: in base Almaigne Spelte: and amongst the kinds of
Far, it should seem to be Venniculum album.

Zea. Far. Spelt.


The Nature.
Spelt is of Nature like unto wheat, but somewhat colder, drawing near to the
complexion of barley, and somewhat drying.

The Virtues.
The meal of Spelt, with red wine, is very profitable against ye stinginges of
Scorpions, and for such as spet blood.







Turner lib. 2. fol. 131.

Of Amilcorne. Chap. iij.
The Description.
THIS grain is also like unto wheat in the straw, joints, and growing, but
that the ears be not bare or not like wheat, but rough with many sharp
pointed ears or beardes, like the ears of Barley: and the corns grow by
ranges, like to the corns or graynes of Barley. The seed is also enclosed in
little husks or coueringes, like to spelt, and being cleansed and purged from
his chaffie husk, it is much like to wheat.

The Place.
This Corn grows in many places of Almaigne.

The Time.
Men do also sow it before winter, and it is cut down in July.

The Names.
This Corn is called in high Douch Ammelkorne, That is to say, in base
Almaigne Amelcorne, and in Latin Amyleum frume^tum: and is a kind of Zea, and
Far: and it should seem to be Halicastrum. It may be englished, Amelcorne, or
bearded Wheat.

The Nature, and Virtue.


Amyleum frumentum.




Of Typhewheate / called in Latin Triticum Romanorum. Chap. iiij.
The Description.




The Place.




Triticum Romanoru^, aut Triticum Barbatum. Roman Wheat.


Triticum Typhinum. Typhwheate.


The Names.
Meteil: in high Douch Welsche Weyssen, that is to say in Latin, Triticum
Romanu^: in base Almaigne, Romsche terwe: of some it is called in Greek (...):
in Latin Typha, and also Typha cerealis, as a token of knowledge from another
Typha, which is called Typha palustris: we may call it Typhe wheat or Bearded
wheat, and Roman wheat.

Typha, if the seed were enclosed in little chaffie skins like unto Spelt,
but seeing it is naked like wheat, therefore it cannot be Typha, although in
other respects it is very much like Typha, of Theophrastus and Galen,
therefore it may be well called Triticum Tiphinum.

The Nature.
This Corn is of temperature, somewhat like to the other, but not so good.

Of Spelt corn / Spelt wheat. Chap. v.
The Description.
ZEopyron is a strange grain, very much like Spelt, in the straw, knottes,
and ears: yet the seed or grain is better like wheat, for it is not closed
up in the husk like Spelt, but it comes forth easyly in thresshing like
wheat: and it has a brown yellowish color like wheat.

The Place.
This kind of grain, does also grow in some places of Almaigne.

The Time.
Men sow, and cut it down like other corn.

The Names.
This corn as Galen writes in his first book, Dealimentis, has been called
in the Country of Bithynia in Greece (...), Zeopyron. The which is a
compounde name, of Zea (that is to say, Spelt) and Pyros, that is to say,
Wheat, the which name is very agreeable unto this Corn, because it is like to
them both, or as a mean betwixt them both. The Almaignes call it Kern,
Drinkelkern, and Kernsamen, that is to say in base Almaigne Keerensaet.

The Nature, and operation.
Zeopyron is of temperature, not much differing from Spelt.

Zeopyron is better then the bread made of Briza, and is as it were a mean or
middle cast bread, betwixt wheaten bread, and the bread made of Briza, as
winesseth Galien.

Zeopyron.


Of single Spelt. Chap. vi.
The Description.
BRiza is also something like to Spelt, saving that it has the ears, motes,
and strawes, lesser, smaller, and shorter, the ears be bearded, and the
beardes are sharp, like the beardes of Barley. The seed is covered with a
husk like to Spelt. The whole plant with his straw, ears, and grain is of
a brown read color, and it makes brown bread, of a very strange and
unpleasant taste.

The Place.
This corn loves rough and rude places, and has not to do with the champion
ground. It has been found in times past of Galen, in Macedonia, and Thracia:
but now it is grown in some places of Douchlande, being brought first thither
out of Thracia, as it is easy to conjecture. The which Country the Turks do
now call Roman, the chiefest city whereof is Constantinoble.

The Time.
Men sow it in September, and cut it in Summer, as other fruits of the like
kinds.

The Names.
This grain is now called in Douche Blicken, Sant Peter's Corn, and Einkorne:
in Nether Douchlande Eencoren. It should seem to be a kind of Zea
Monococcos, and Briza.
Zea simplex, of Dioscorides, and the Zea of Mnesitheus, the which Galen in his
book, De aliment. facult. thinks to be that grain, which in his time was
called in Thracia and Macedonia, (...), Briza. It should also seem to be the
kind of Far which Columella names Far Venniculum rutilum.

The Nature, and operation:


Of Rye. Chap. vij.
The Kinds.
AS the wheat described in the first Chapter, is diverse, according to the
times or seasons of sowing, even in like manner is the Rye: for the one kind
is sown before winter, and the other after winter.

The Description.




The Place.
Rye grows in all the low Country of Flaunders, and in many other Regions,
it loves the barren soil, that is dry and sandy, where as none other corn or
grain may grow, as in the Country of Brabant, the which is called Kempene,
and other like dry soyles. Yet for all that, the best Rye grows in good and
fertile soyles.

The Time.
The first kind is sown in September, and the other in March, and are both
ripe in July.

Secale.


The Names.
This grain is called of Pliny in Latin Secale: in English Rye: in French
Seigle: in high Almaigne Rocken: in base Alemaigne Rogghe: in Italian Segala:
of some Asia, of others Farrago: although this is not the true Farrago, for
Farrago is none other thing, but Barley, Otes, and such like graynes mingled
together and sown for forage or prouender for Cattle: the which men do mow
and cut before it is ripe, to feed their Oxen, Kyen, Horses, and other like
cattle.

And that this grain is not Siligo, it is sufficiently declared in our fourth
book of the History af Plants Chapt. j.

The Nature.
Rye laid outwardly to the body, is hoate and dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.








Of Barley. Chap. viij.
The Kinds.
BArley is of two sorts, great and small, to the which they have now put two
other kinds, that is to say, a kind without husk: and another kind called
Douche Barley or Rice.

1. Hordeum Polystichu^ Winter Barley. Bear Barley.
3. Hordeum Nudum. Naked orbare Barley. Wheat Barley.


2. Hordeum Dystichum. Summer Barley. Common Barley.
4. Oriza. Rice.


The Description.








The Place.






The Time.
Men do sow the great Barley in September, and they mow or cut it in July,
and sometime in June.

The lesser or common Barley is sown in the spring time, and is ripe in August.

The Names.
Barley is called in Greek (...): in Latin Hordeum: in French Orge: in
Douche Gerst.

Hordeum Cantherinum: in high Douche Grosz Gerst: in base Almaigne Groote
Gerste. I take this for Bear Barley,

Galatinum Hordeum: in high Douch Fuder Gerst: in base Almaigne Voeder Gerste.

Hordeum mundum, and may be well called in Greek (...), Gymnocrithon, that is
to say in Latin Hordeum nudum, as Galen sets forth in his book Dealiment
faculta.

Oriza Germanica. It should seem to the eye, to be a kind of Far, especially
that Far Clusinum, which resembles much Santalum Plinij. It should seem
also to be (...), Olyra, of Dioscorides, which is called in Latin not Siligo,
but Arinca: in English Rise.

The Nature.
Barley is cold and dry in the first degree.

The Virtues.


Strumae.











Of Mill / or Millet. Chap. ix.
Milium.


Lachryma Job.


The Description.
MIllet has a hearie stalk, with seven or eight knottes or joints. The
leaves be long and like the leaves or blades of Polereede: at the highest of
the stemmes come forth the bushie ears, very much severed and parted, like
the plume or feather of the Cane or Polereede, almost like a brushe or besome
to sweep withal, in which grows the seed, very round and plain almost
like to lineseede, but that it is not so black.

For one kind of Milium is likewise taken of some, that which is named
Lachrima Job, and it has many knottie stalks, about a foot and a half high,
and thereon broad reed leaves, between the which comes forth round
fruit upon thin stalks, about the bigness of a pease, thereof come forth
small ears. The roots have strong threddie stringes.

The Place.
Mill loves a moist and claye ground, it grows abundantly in Italy and
Spain.

Lachryma Job is in this Country strange, and is found only in the gardens of
some diligent Herboristes.

The Time.
They sow it in the spring time, and it is ripe in somer, it may be kept along
time, even a hundred years, so it be kept from the wind.

The Names.
This plant is called in Greek (...): in Latin of the Apothecaries Miliu^: in
English Mill, Millet, and Hirse: in French Mil, or Millet: in high Douche
Hirsen: in nether Douchlande Hirs, or Milie. What other name Lachryma Job
has, is unknown unto us.

The Nature.
Millet is cold in the first degree, and dry almost in the third degree, and
of subtle parts.

The Virtues.




Of Turkey Corn / or Indian Wheat. Chap. x.
The Kinds.
TUrkish wheat is of one, and of many sorts. A man shall not find in this
Country (in fashion and growing) more then one kind, but in color the seed
or grain does much differ: for one bears a brown grain or Corn, the
other a red, the third a yellowe, and the fourth a white Corn or grain. The
which color does likewise remain both in the ears and flowers.

The Description.
THis Corn is a marvelous strange plant, nothing resembling any other kind
of grain: for it brings forth his seed clean contrary from the place
where as the flowers grow, which is against the nature and kinds of all other
plants, which bring forth their fruit there, where as they have borne their
flower. This corn bears a high helm or stemine, and very long, round,
thick, firm, and below toward the root of a brownishe color, with
sundry knottes and joints, from the which depends long, and large leaves,
like the leaves of spiere or Polereede: at the highest of the stalks, grow
idle and barren ears, which bring forth nothing but the flowers or
blossoms, which are sometimes brown, sometimes read, sometimes yellow, and
sometimes white, agreeable with the color of the fruit which comes forth
afterward. The fruitful ears do grow upon the sides of the stemmes
amongst the leaves, the which ears be great and thick and covered with many
leaves, so that one cannot see the said ears, upon the uppermost part of ye
said ears there grow many long hearie threddes, which issue forth at the
ends or points of the leaves covering the ear, and do show them selves,
about the time that the fruit or ear waxes ripe. The grain or seed which
grows in the ears, is about the quantity or bigness of a pease of color
in the outside sometimes brown, sometime red, and sometime white, and in the
inside it is in color white, and in taste sweet, growing orderly about the
ears, in niene or ten ranges or rewes.

The Place.
This grain grows in Turkey whereas it is used in the time of dearth.

The Time.
It is sown in April, and ripe in August.

The Names.
They do now call this grain Frumentum Turcicum, and Frume^tum Asiaticum: in
French Ble de Turquie, or Ble Sarrazin: in high Douche Turkey Korn: in base
Almaigne Torckschcoren: in English Turkish Corn, or Indian wheat.

Frumentum Turcicum. Turkish or Indian wheat.


The Nature and Virtues.




Of petie Panick / Phalaris grise / grass corn. Chap. xi.
The Description.
PHalaris has a round straw or helm, with three or four joints, the
leaves be narrow and grassie, like the blades of Spelt or wheat but smaller
and shorter, upon the said straw grows a short thick ear, and clustered
or gathered together. it brings forth a seed like unto Mill, and in fashion
like to Line seed.

The Place.
This seed grows in Spain, and in the Isles of Canarie. And is only sown
in this Country of the Herboristes.

The Time.
It is ripe in this Country in July and August.

The Names.
This seed is called in Greek (...): and likewise in Latin Phalaris: of some
Douchme^ Spaensch saet, and Saet van Canarien, that is to say, Spanishe or
Canarie seed, some Apothecaries do sell it for Millet. Turner calls it Petie
Panicke.

The Nature.
In complexion, it is much like to Millet.

The Virtues.
Phalaris dronken with water, is good against the pain or grief of the
bladder.

And a spoenfull of the seed made into powder is good to be taken for the same
purpose.

Of Panicke. Chap. xij.
The Description.


Phalaris.


Sorghi. This strange grain has four or five high stemmes, which are thick,
knottie, and somewhat brownish, beset with long sharp leaves, not much unlike
the leaves of Spier or Poole reed, at the uppermost part of the stalks, there
grow thick brownered ears, greater and thicker then the ears of Panick, the
which at the first do bring forth a yellow flower, and afteward a round reddish
sede, of the quantity of a lentil, and somewhat sharp or pointed.

The Place.




The Time.


Panicum. Panik.


Sorghi. Melica. Indian Panick.




The Names.
Panicum: and now a days in Italian Melica: in high Douche Feuch, Fenich, and
Heydelpfenich: in base Almaigne Panickoren.

Melegua, or Melega, of some others, Saggina, and Sorgho* in Latin Melica
Sorghi, Milium Saburrum, and of some Panicum peregrinum: of the Almaignes
Sorgsamen: of the Brabanders Sorgsaet. It is very like that this is Milium
Indicum, which as Pliny writes, was first known in the time of the Emperor
Nero.

The Nature.
Panick is cold and dry of complexion.

The Virtues.






Of Otes. Chap. xiij.
The Description.






The Place.


Turner says they grow in Sussex.



The Time.
Otes are sown in the spring time, and are ripe in August.

The Names.
Auena: in high Douche Habern: in base Almaigne Hauer: in French Auoyne.



Auena sterilis: which you may see described in the xvj. Chapter of this
fourth book.

The Nature.
Otes do dry much, and are of complexion somewhat cold, as Galien says.

Auena.


The Virtues.








Of Gockwheate. Chap. xiiij.
The Description.
BOckwheate has round stalks chauellured and fluted (or forowed and crested)
of a reddishe color, about the height of two foot or more: The leaves are
broad and sharp at the ends, not much unlike the leaves of Iuie or common
Wythiwinde. It puts forth short stemmes, as well on the sides as on the top
of the stalks, upon the said short stemmes there grow many white flowers in
tuftes or clusters, after the said flowers comes the sede, which is triangled
and gray, enclosed in a little felme or skin, like the seed of black
bindeweede, described in the third part of the history of plants.

The Place.
They sow it in lean and dry ground, and is very common in the lands of
Brabant called Kempene.

The Time.
It is sown in the spring time, and in somer after the cutting down of Corn,
and is ripe niene or ten weeks after.

Fegopyron. Tragopyron.


The Names.
This kind of grain and plant is called in French Dragee aux cheueaux: in
high Douche Heydenkorne: in base Almaigne Bockweydt, after which name it may
be englished Bockwheat, The Author of this work calls it Tragopyro^,
certain others do call it in Greek (...), and in Latin Fagotriticum, which
is not O^ymum, described by Columel, as we have sufficiently declared in the
fourth book of our History of Plants, where as we have in like manner
declared how it was unknown of the Auncientes. I think this to be the grain
called in some places of England Bolimonge.

The Nature.
This seed without fail is endued with no heat, and is not very dry.

The Virtues.






Of Iuray or Darnell. Chap. xv.
The Description.
IVray is a vicious grain that combereth or anoyeth corn, especially wheat,
and in his knottie Straw, blades, or leaves is like unto wheat, but his ears
do differ both from wheat and Rye ears, for they are divided into many small
ears growing upon the sides at the top of the straw, in the which small
ears the seed is contained, in proportion almost like wheat corns, but
much smaller.

The Place.
Iuray for the most part grows amongst wheat, and sometimes it is also
found amongst Barley, especially in good land, where as wheat has grown
before.

The Time.
It waxes ripe with ye wheat and other corn.

Lolium.


The Names.
This plant is called in Greek (...). in Latin Lolium: of the Arabians
Zizania: in French Yuraye, or Gasse. in English it is also called Iuraye,
Darnell, and Rain.

The Nature.
Iuray is hoate even almost in the third degree, and dry in the second.

The Virtues.














Of Pour Otes Festuca and Melampyrum. Chap. xvi.
Aegilops. Pour Otes.


Festuca altera. Drauick wild Otes.


The Description.


Festuca, or as the Douchmen call it Drauick, is also a hurtful plant, having
his leaves and straw not much unlike Rye, at the top whereof grow spreading
ears, wherein is contained a small seed of grayishe color, enclosed in little
skins or small husks, much less and smaller then any other kind of corn
or grain.



The Place.
You shall find much of this gear amongst Rye, and oftentimes amongst wheat
and Barley.

The Names.
The first is called in Greek (...): in Latin Aegilops, and according to
Pliny Festuca: in English Wild Otes, or Pour Otes.

Festuca, or Festuca altera: in English Wild Otes, or Drauick.

The Nature.
Pour Otes are hoate, as Galen testifies.

The Virtues.
Aegilops) is good to heal hollow ulcers called Fistulas, especially those
which are in the corners of the Eyes, called Aegilopes.



Melampyru^ Black wheat. Cow wheat or Horse flower.


Of Blight or Brantcorne. Chap. xvij.
The Description.
VStilago is a certain disease, or infirmity, that happens unto such
fruits as ebare ears, but especially unto Otes. This kind of plant, before
it shuteth out in ear is very like unto Otes, but when it begins to put
forth his ear, in steed of a good care, there comes up a black burnt
ear, full of black dust or powder.

The Place.
It grows most commonly (as is beforesaid) amongst Otes, and sometimes
amongst wheat.

The Time.
It is found most commonly in April, when as the Son shines very hoate,
and after a rain following.

The Names.
This barren and unfruitful herb is now called Vstilago, that is to say,
Burned, or Blighted: in French Brulure: in high and base Almaigne Brant.

The Nature, and faculties.
Vstilago has no good property in Physic, and serves to no manner of good
purpose, but is rather a hurt or maladye to all Corn.

Vstilago.


Of Beans. Chap. xviij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of beans. The one sort is commonly sown, the other is
wild. The common or manured bean, is divided again into two sorts, that is:
great, and small.

Phaselus satiuus. Sown Beans.


Phaselus syluestris. Wild Beans.


The Description.




and woolly within, as it were laid with a soft Down or Cotton, but nothing so
much as the coddes of the common sown beans. The fruit is all round and
very black and no bigger then a good pease, of a strong unpleasant savor, and
when it is chewed, it fills the mouth full of stinking matter.

The Place.
The domestical, or husbandly beans, do grow in feeldes and gardens where as
they be sown or planted. The wild is to be found amongst the Herboristes:
and grows of his own kind in Languedoc.

The Time.
They are planted and sown in November, January, February and April, and are
ripe in June and July.

The Names.
Beans are called in Greek (...), of Dioscorides also Phasioli: in Latin
Faseli: now a days they be called in Shoppes, and commonly Fabae: in high and
base Almaigne Bonen.

Phaselus mayor, or Faselus satiuus mayor: in Douche, Groote Boonen: in
English, Great Beans, and garden Beans.

Faseli minores, that is to say, The smaller Bean, in Brabant Zeeusche
Boonkens, and Peerde Boonkens. That the common Bean is not that kind of pulse
called of the Auncientes Cyamos, and Faba, has been sufficiently declared, In
Historia nostra.

Faselus syluestris, and Faselus niger, that is to say, The wild Bean, and
the black Bean: in Douch, Wild Boonen, and Swerte Boonen, or Moorkens, as
some do call them. This may well be that Pulse which is called Cyamos, and Faba.

The Nature.
Green beans before they be ripe, are cold, and moist: but when they be dry
they have power to bind and restrain.

The Virtues.








Of Kidney Bean / or garden Smilax. Chap. xix.
The Description.
GArden Smilax has long and small branches, growing very high, griping, and
taking holdfast when they be succored with rises or long poles, about the
which, they wrappe and wind them selves, as the Hoppe, otherwise they lie
flat and creep on the ground, and bear no fruit at all. The leaves be broad
almost like Iuie, growing three and three together as the Trefoil or three
leaued grass. The flowers be sometimes white and sometimes red, after the
flowers there come in their places long coddes, which be sometimes crooked, and
in them lie the seeds or fruit, smaller then the common bean, and flat
fashioned like to a kidney of color sometimes red, sometimes, yellow, sometimes
white, sometimes black, and sometimes gray, and speckled with sundry colors.
This fruit is good and pleasant to eat, in so much that men gather and boil
the^ before they be ripe, and do eat them coddes and all.

The Place.
In this Country men plant this kind of Beans in gardens, and they love good
ground and places that stand well in the Son.

The Time.
They are planted in April after that the cold and frostes be past: for at
their first coming up, they can by no means at all endure cold. They are
ripe in August and September.

The Names.
This kind of Beans are called in Greek (...): in Latin Faseolus, Dolichus,
and Smilax hortensis. The coddes or fruit are called (...), that is in Latin
Siliquae, and Lobi: of Serapio Lubia: in French Phaseoles. in high Douch
Welsch Bonen: in base Almaigne Roomsche Boonen: in English of Turner it is
called Kidney bean, and Sperage, of some they are called Faselles, or Long
Peason, it may be also named Garden Smilax, or Roman Beans.

Phaseolus.


The Nature.
Kidney beans are somewhat hoate and moist of Complexion, after the opinion of
the Arabian Physicians.

The Virtues.




Of Pease or Peason. Chap. xx.
The Kinds.
THere be three kinds of Peason, the great, the mean, and the small, the which
are like one another, in stalks, leaves, flowers and coddes, but not in
fruit, as ye may perceive hereafter.

The Description.
at every knot there grow two leaves, very well closed and joined together, as
if it were but one leaf: amongst the leaves grow small stemmes, the which have
four or five gross or fat leaves set directly opposite, one against
another, having at the end four or five griping or ramping claspers, whereby
the Pease does take hold, and is stayed up, and fastened to such things as it
stands by. Adjoining hard to the stemmes of the leaves aforesaid, there
grow other naked and bare stemmes, upon the which grow pleasant flowers of
blew or purple color. After the said flowers there come up long coddes,
round, plain, and shining, hanging downewardes, in which the Peason are
couched and laid, the which being yet but green, are round and whitishe,
but when they be dry, they are gray and cornered.

Pisum. Great Peason. Branche Peason.


Ochros. Eruilia. Middle Peason.






Cicercula, (which Turner calls Cicheling.) The flowers are white, after the
which flowers there come up round coddes or husks, lesser then pease-coddes,
within them grows the fruit, which is round like unto Pease, saving it is
lesser, and in taste bitter, while it is yet green, and very hard when it is
dry.

The Place.




The Time.
Men plant them in March and April, and they be ripe in August.

Eruilia syluestris. Wild Peason.


The Names.
Pisum: in Brabant Groote Erweten, Roomsche Erweten, and of some Stock Erweten.
This kind is the right Pisum, described of Pliny and the Auncientes: in
English Great Peason, Garden Peason, and Branche Peason, because, as I think,
they must be helped or stayed up with branches.

Eruiliae: in French Pois in high Douch Erweyssen: in base Almaigne Erweten: in
Italian Rouiglione: at Veniz Pisareli: in English, Common Peason.

Hermolaus Barbarus writes, calling it Eruilia syluestris, that is to said
wild Peason.

The Nature, and Virtues.
Faba.



Of the Cicheling or flat Peason. Chap. xxi.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Cichelinges, the great and the small, or garden and
wild Cichelinges.

Lathyrus Cicercula. Cicheling or broad Peason.


Lathyrus syluestris. Wild Cicheling.


The Description.






The Place.




The Time.
These Pulses do flower in June, and are ripe in July and August.

The Names.
Lathyrus: of Columella and Paladius Cicercula. Turner calls it a Cicheling.

Aracus: in Latin Cicera They are both called in French Des Sars but they
have no Douche name that I know, yet the Author of this book in the last
Douche copy by him corrected, calls the first kind in Douche Platte Erwten,
that is to say in English, Broad or Flat Pease: not known of the Apothecaries.

The Nature, and Virtues.




Of Chiche Peason. Chap. xxij.
The Kinds.
There be three kinds of Ciche Peason (as Dioscorides writes) the domestical
or tame kind, the square or cornered kind, the which some do call Arietinum,
and the wild Ciche, and there be two sorts of that kind which is called
Arietinum, white, and black.

Cicer satiuum. Tame Ciches.


Cicer Arietinum. Sheep Ciches.


The Description.






The Place.
These Ciche Peason, are found planted in the gardens of Herboristes.

The Time.
All the Ciches are ripe in August, like to the other sorts of pulse.

The Names.
Ciche Peason are called in Greek (...): in Latin Cicer: in French Cices* or
Pois Cice.

Cicer satiuum, Columbinum Venereu^: and in Greek (...), Orobiaeon, that is to
say in Latin Cicer eruillum: unknown in Shoppes. This is not Eruum, as many
at this time do think, and for that purpose they put it into their triacles
and other such medicines.

Cicer Arietinum, that is to say, Sheep Ciche pease: in Shoppes Cicer: in
English Sheep Cichpeason, in French Pois Ciches: in high Douch Zysern
erweyssen: in base Almaigne Ciceren.

Cicer syluestre, that is to say, Wild Ciches.

The Nature.
The Ciche pease is hoate and dry in the first degree.

The Virtues.


Orobus (called in English the bitter Fiche) does assuage and heal the
blastinges or swellings of the yearde or privy members, if it be laid
thereon: also men use with great profit, to apply it to running sores, and
ulcers of the head, and the scurffe.





and swellings behind the ears.



The Danger.
The use of Ciches is not very good for them which have any vlceration, in the
kidneyes or bladder, for they be to much scouring, and do cause the urine to be
sharp.

Of Lupines. Chap. xxiij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Lupines, the white or garden Lupine, and the wild
Lupine. The wild kind again is of sundry sorts for sometimes you shall see
some of them with a yellowe flower, sometimes with a blewe flower, and
sometimes with a reddishe flower.

Lupinus Satiuus.


Lupinus syluestris. Lupines.


The Description.






The Place.
The Herboristes do plant Lupines in their gardens. The wild with the blewe,
do grow amongst the corn about Monpellier.

The Time.
In warm Countries and hoate seasons, the Lupine flowreth three times a year.
The first flower comes forth about the end of May, afterward the three first
collateral branches do spring out, the which three branches do likewise
flower about the beginning of July. The said collateral bows or branches, do
again bring forth three other branches, and they do flower in August, where
as they be well placed in the Son. The fruit of the first and second
bloweing does come to perfect ripenes in this Country, but the third blowing
does hardly come to ripeness, except it chance in a very hoate summer.

The Names.
This kind of pulse is called in Greek (...): in Latin and in Shoppes,
Lupinus: in French Lupin in English Lupines: in high Douche Feigbonen: in base
Almaigne Lupinen, and Vijchboonen.

The first kind is called Lupinus satiuus, that is to say, The manured or
garden Lupine.

The three other sorts are called Wild Lupines, in Latin Lupini syluestres:
and these be not used in medicine.

The Nature.
The garden Lupine is hoate and dry in the second degree, it has virtue to
digest, make subtle, and to cleanse.

The Virtues.












gross blood, and gross humors. For Lupins are hard to digest, and uneasy
to descend, as Galen says.



Of the bitter Veche called in Greek Orobos, and in Latin Eruum. Chap. xxiiij.
The Description.
ERuum or the bitter Fetch is now unknown, and therefore we can give none
other description, but so much as is written in Dioscorides and Galen. They say
that Orobos, or Eruilia is a small plant, bearing his fruit in coddes, round,
of a white or yellowish color, of a strange and unpleasant taste, so that they
serve not to be eaten, but of cattle, neither will cattle feed upon them,
before that with long soking or stieping in water, their unpleasant taste be
gone and lost: wherefore it is very easy to judge, that the flat Pease called
in Greek Lathyri, and described in the xxj. Chapter of this book, are not Ers
or Eruilia, as some have thought: for those flat Peason are in taste like the
common Peason, as we have before declared.

The Names.
This pulse is called in Greek (...): in Latin Eruum: and the Frenchmen
following the Latin name, do call it Ers: in Douche Eruen: in English Bitter
Vetche, or Ers.

The Nature.
Ers are hoate in the first degree, and dry in the second.

The Virtues.
Eruum often licked in with honey in manner of a Lohoch, cleanses the breast, and
cutteth and ripeth gross and tough humors, falling upon the lunges.











The Danger.
Ers or Orobos being used often, and in to great a quantity causes headache,
and heavy dullness, it brings forth blood, both by the urine, and
excrementes of the belly.

Of the Vetche. Chap. xxv.
THe Vetche has stalks of a sufficient thickness, and square about the heigh
of three foot, with leaves displayed and spread abroad, compassed about with
many small leaves, set opposite one direetly against another: at the end of
which leaves, ye have tendrelles or claspers whereby it takes hold and is
stayed up. The flowers are purple and fashioned like the Beaneflowers,
afterward there come up long flat coddes, wherein are Vetches, which are flat
and of a blackish color.

The Place.
They sow Vetches in this Country, in the feeldes, for fourrage or prouender
for Horses.

The Time.
They be ripe in July and August.

The Names.
This pulse is called in Greek (...), and of some (...): in Latin Vicia: of
some Osmu^di: in English a Vetche, or Vetches: in French Vesse: in high Douche
Wicken: in base Almaigne Vitsen. And that this is not Eruum, it appears
evidently by that which is described in the former Chapter. This should seem
to be Theophrastus Aphace or Taare.

The cause of the Name.
The Vetche, as Varro says, is called in Latin Vicia, because it binds it
self about other plants, and ouercometh them, and is derived from this Latin
word (Vincire) which signifies to bind sure, to overcome and to restrain
from liberty.

Vicia.


The Nature and Virtues.
The Vetche is not used in medicine, neither used to be eaten of men, but to be
given to Horses and other cattle, and this Galen does also witness.

Of Arachus or wild Fitche. Chap. xxvi.
The Description.
ARachus is much like to the common Vetche, in stalks, leaves, and coddes,
but in all these much less. The stalks be tender, weak and sle^der with
cornered trayles or square crested edges. The leaves are spread abroad like
the other Vetche, but cloven and parted above at the ends, into two or three
clasping tendrelles. The flowers be small, of a light purple, or incarnate
color, and do grow upon the stalk self, as the flowers of beans or common
Vetches do, without any foot stalks. The coddes be small, long, and narrow,
wherein is couched six or seven seeds, of a blackishe color, hard, and
smaller than Vetches.

Arachus.




The Place.
These two kinds of Vetches do grow in the feeldes, amongst Rye and Otes, and
other like graynes.

The Time.
They are both ripe in June.

The Names.
This plant is called of Galen, Lib. 1. de alimentorum facultatibus, (...),
Arachus, the which name is written by chin the last syllabe, as a difference
from the other (...) Aracus, written with ac, whereof we have already treated.
They call it in French Vesseron: in Brabant, Crock: in English, Wild Vetche.

The Nature, and Virtues.
Arachus or the wild Vetche, is not fit for man, but serves only for prouender
or fourrage, for Bieues and horses, unto whom the whole herb is given.

Of small wild Fetchelinges. Chap. xxvij.
Galega altera. Vetcheling or small wild Fitches.


Onobrichis forte, Medica Ruellij. Saint Foin. Medick Vetcheling.


Arachus, described in the former Chapt. in stalks leaves and clasping
tendrelles, but that his flowers grow not in the like order, but do grow in
tuffed clusters about long stemmes, almost like to spiked ears, of color
purple in blew, the which past and gone, there come up little flat husks,
wherein lies the seed, like to the seed of Arachus.



The Place.




The Time.
The wild Vetche flowreth most commonly in June, and soon after it delivers
his coddes and grain.

The other flowreth in July, and for the most part delivers his seed
forthwith.

The Names.
Galega altera, and a kind of little Vetches, and may also be well called
Arachus, and taken for a kind of Arachus: in French Vesce sauuage: in Douch
Wilder Wicken: in nether Douchlande, Wild Vitsen: in English Small wild
Vetches or Vitchelinges.

Onobrychis, of Ruelius for Medica, they name it in French Saint Foin: we may
call it, Yellow Fitcheling, and Medick fitche.

The Nature and Virtues.
Arachus, and therefore it serves only but for pasture, and feeding for
cattle, as other like herbs do.

Onobrychis, you shall find his properties described in the Chapter of
Onobrychis.

Of Tares. Chap. xxviij.
The Description.
THe Tare has long, tender, square stalks, longer and higher then the stalks
of the lentil, growing almost as high as the wheat or corn, or the other
plants whereamongst it grows. The leaves be small and tender (triangled like
a scuchion) somewhat round, growing always two together, one against another at
the joints, betwixt the said leaves there grow up clasping tendrels, and other
small stems or shutes, whereupon grow flowers, of a yellowish color. The
flowers past there rise coddes somewhat large, and longer then the coddes or
husks of the Lentiles, in which is contained five or six black seeds,
hard, flat, and shining, lesser then the seeds of lentiles.

The Place.
The Tare grows in feeldes, and is found growing in this Country, in fertile
grounds amongst wheat and Rye.

The Time.
In this Country it flowreth in May, and in June and July the seed with the
coddes is ripe.

The Names.
This kind of Pulse is called in Greek (...): in Latin Aphaca: in English,
Tares: unknown in shoppes, this is the Aphace of Dioscorides and Galen: for it
should seem, that the Vetche is the Aphace of Theophrastus.

The Nature.
The Tare is temperate in heat, and of like nature to the Lentil: but drier.

The Virtues.






Aphaca.


Of Birds foot. Chap. xxix.
The Description.
Birds foot is like to Arachus, and to the wild Vetche, but far smaller. It
has very slender and small stalks or branches, soft and tender, the leaves be
small and round, fashioned like to a small fether. The flowers be yellowishe
and small, growing close together upon husks or stems, the which being
withered, there comes up in their places small crooked husks or coddes,
growing five or six together, ye which in their standing do show almost like
the closing foot of a small bird. Within the said little crooked coddes the
seed is enclosed, in fashion not much unlike Turnep seed.

The Place.
Birds foot grows in certain fields, and is likewise found in high
meadows, and in dry grassie ways and Countries. That which grows in
meadows, and grassie ways, is a great deal smaller, then that which grows
amongst the corn.

The Time.
Birds foot flowreth from after the month of June, until September, and
within this space it delivers his seed.

Ornithopodium.


The Names.
This wild herb is called in Brabant Voghelvoet, that is to say in English,
Birds foot, or Foul foot, because his husks or cods are like to a birds
foot, and for that cause men may well call it (...), Ornithopodion, for it has
none other Greek nor Latin name (that I know) except it be that Polygala of
Dioscorides, as it may be called, whereunto it is very like.

The Nature and Virtues.
This herb is not used in medicine, nor received any ways for man's use, but
is a very good food both for horses and cattle.

Of Zentilles. Chap. xxx.
The Description.
THe Lentil has small tender and plyant branches, about a cubite high. The
leaves be very small, the which are placed two and two upon little stems, or
small footestalkes, and do sometimes end with clasping tendrelles, whereby it
hitcheth fast and takes sure hold. The flowers be small, of a brownishe color,
intermixed with white. The husks or shelles are flat. The fruit is round and
flat, of color now black, now white, and sometimes brown.

The Place.
The Lentil is not very well known in this Country, but is found sown in the
gardens of Herboristes.

The Time.
The Lentil does both flower and wax ripe in July and August.

The Names.
This Pulse is called in Greek (...): in Latin Lens, and Lenticula, by which
name it is known in Shoppes: in English Lentilles: in French Lentille: in
high Douche Linsen.

Lens.


The Nature.
The Lentil is dry in the second degree, the residue is temperate.

The Virtues.




















The Danger ensuing the use of this pulse.
The Lentil is of hard digestion, it engenders windiness, and blastinges in
the stomach, and subuerteth the same, they cause doting madness and foolish
toys, and terrible dreams: it hurts the lunges, the sinews and the brain.
And if one eat to much thereof, it dulleth the sight, and brings the people
that use thereof, in danger of Cankers, and the Leprie.

Of Hatchet Fitche / Axsede or Axwurt. Chap. xxxi.
Hedysaron. Securidaca. Axesiche, or Axwurt.


Securidaca altera.


The Description
SEcuridaca has small slender stemmes, whereupon grow small leaves spread
abroad like to the leaves of Arachus, or the wild Vetche, but smaller and
rounder. The flowers grow thick together, after the said flowers, there come
long coddes, round and small, growing one against another, bowing inward, and
crooking or crompling like unto horns, within which crooked coddes, is
contained a flat seed with flower corners, like to a little wedge. The root is
small and tender.

Securidaca set forth by Matthiolus, in leaves is very well like to the
aforesaid, nevertheless his coddes be longer, and not so much crooked: and for
that consideration not very well approaching to the description of Securidaca,
set forth by Dioscorides.

Ferrum equinum. Horse shoe.


Securidata, but yet somewhat lesser, betwixt those leaves, and the trayling
branches it bears small yellow flowers, in fashion like to the flowers of the
Vetche or Lentill: the which afterward do change into flat husks or coddes,
the which are upon one side full of deep Chinkes, or Cliftes, and the grain
or seed waxing ripe, the said coddes do turn crooked upon one side, so that
they bear the form and fashion of a horse shoe. The sede also is crooked, and
turned round like a Croisssant or new Moon.

The Place.
Securidaca, as Galen says, grows in some places amongst Lentiles: or
according to Dioscorides, amongst Barley and wheat, unknown in this
Country, and is not known to grow but in the gardens of Herboristes.



The Time.
Securidaca flowreth in this Country, in July and August, and afterward the
seed is ripe.



The Names.
Securidaca; of some also Pelecinon: in Douch and French it has no name that I
know. Turner calls it in English Axsich, or Axeworte, because Dioscorides
says the seed is like a two edged Axe.

Fer di Caualla, that is to say in Latin, Ferrum equinum: and in English Horse
shoe: in French Fer de Cheual: in Brabant Peerts ysere. It should seem that
this is a kind of Securidaca: and therefore we have placed it in this Chapter.

The Nature.
The seed of Securidaca is hoate and dry of complexion.

The Horse shoe is in quality and virtue like to Securidaca, as you may know
by his bitterness.

The Virtues.
Securidaca, opens the stoppinges of the liver, the Spleen, and all the
inward parts, and is very good for the stomach, because of his bitterness.



Of Italian Fitche / or Goats Rue. Chap. xxxij.
The Description.
THis herb is not much unlike Arachus or the wild Vetche in stalks and
leaves: it has round hard stalks, and thereupon displayed leaves, made of
diverse.small leaves like to the leaves of Vesseron or Arachus, but much
greater and longer. The flowers be either clear blewe, or white, and do grow
clustering together spikewise, and like to the wild Vetche, after come long,
small, and round coddes, wherein is the seed. The root is meetely great, and
does not lightly die.

The Place.
Galega in some Countries (as in Italy) grows in the borders of feeldes, it
grows also in the wood called Madrill by Paris. Ye shall not lightly find it
in this Country, but sown in the gardens of Herbozistes.

The Time.
Galega flowreth in July and August, and forth with the seed is ripe.

Galega.


The Names.
This herb is called of the Herboristes of these days, in Latin Galega, Ruta
Capraria, and of some Foenograecum syluestre. And some do also count it to be
Glaux* or Polygala, but as I think it is nothing like any of them: it is
called in English* Italian Fetch, and Goats Rue.

The Nature.
Galega is of nature hoate and dry.

The Virtues.
Galega, as Baptista Sardus writes, is a singular herb against al venom and
poison, and against worms to kill and drive them forth, if the juice of it be
given to little children to drink.







Of the Pease Earthnut. Chap. xxxiij.
The Description.




The Place.
The Pease Earthnut, grows abundantly in Hollande and other places, as in
Brabant, near Barrow, by the river Zoom, amongst the Corn, and upon, or
under the hedges. It grows in Richmonde heath, and Coome park, as Turner
says.

Chamaebalanus.


The Time.
This herb flowreth in June, and afterward the seed is ripe. In some places
they draw or pluck up the roots in May, and do eat of them.

The Names.
This herb is called in high Douche Erdnusz, Erckelen, Erdfeigen, Erdamandel,
Acker Eychel, and Grund Eychel: in Braba^t Eerdtnoten, and of some Muysen met
steerten: of the writers in these days in Greek, (...). Chamaebalanos: but
this is not that Chamaebalanus, which is called (...), and (...): in Latin
Glandes terrestres, that is to say, Earthnuttes. Some of the learned do count
it to be Astragalus described by Dioscorides, and some hold it for Apios. But
that it is not Apios, it is manifest enough by the third Chapter of the third
part of this book, where as we have plainly set forth the right Apios.

The Nature.
The pease Earthnut is dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.


Astragalus, his root will provoke urine, and stop all fluxes of the belly,
being boiled in wine and drunk.



Astragalus dried and made into powder, is very good to be strowen upon old
sores, and upon fresh new wounds, to stop the blood of them.

Of Fenugrer. Chap. xxxiiij.
The Description.
FEnugreck has tender stalks, round, blackishe, hollow, and full of branches,
the leaves are divided into three parts, like the leaves of Trifoil, or the
threeleaued grass. The flowers be pale, whitish, and smaller the^ the flowers
of Lupins. After the fading of those flowers, there come up long coddes or
husks, crooked and sharp pointed, wherein is a yellowe seed, the root is
full of small hanging hears.

The Place.
The Herboristes of this Country, do sow it in their gardens.

The Time.
It flowreth in July, and the seed is ripe in August.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin and in Shoppes Foenum Graecum,
of Columella Siliqua: in French Fenugrec, or Fenegrec: in high Douche
Bockshorn, or Kuhorne: in base Alemaigne Fenigriek: in English Fenegreck.

The Nature.
The seed of Fenugreck, is hoate in the second degree, and dry in the first,
and has virtue to soften and dissolve.

The Virtues.


Foenum Graecum.
and diseases of the breast, so that the patient be not vexed with a fever or
the head ache: for such asyrupe is hurtful to the head, and to them that have
agues.

















Of Cameline. Chap. xxxv.
The Description.
MYagru^ or Cameline, has straight round stalks, of ye height of two foot
or more, dividing it self into many branches or boughs. The leaves be long and
narrow, almost like to the leaves of Madder, at the highest of ye stalks,
alo^gest by the^ grow small flowers; and afterward small cups, or sede vessels,
almost like the knoppes of Lineseede, but flatter, within the which is enclosed
a small yellowish seed, of the which an oil is made, by pounding, and
pressing forth of the same.

The Place.
This herb grows in many places amongst wheat, and flax, and the most part
of me^ do deem it as an unprofitable herb: yet for all that it is sown in
many places, because of the oil which the sede yields, as in this Country,
Zeelande, and the Country of Liege, or Luke beyond Brabant.

The Time.
It is sown in March and April, and ripe about August.

Myagrum.


The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...), of some also (...): in Latin Myagrum,
Linum triticeum, and Melampyrum: in French and base Almaigne, Cameline* and of
some Camemine. in high Douche Flaschdotter, and Leindotter: in English Myagru^,
or Cameline: It should seem that this herb is Erysimon, whereof Theophrast and
Galen, Lib. 1. de alimentorum facultatibus, have written.

The Nature.
Myagrum is of a hoate complexion.

The Virtues.
Myagrum straked, or anointed upon the body, does clear and polish the skin
from all roughness.



Of meadow Trifoyl / or three leaued grass. Chap. xxxvi.
The Kinds.
THere be diverse sorts of Trefoyles, the which for the more part of them
shall be set forth in diverse Chapters. But that kind whereof we shall now
entreat, is the common Trefoyl, growing in meadows. The which is of two
sorts, the one with read flowers, the other with white, but for the rest
there is no great difference in these two herbs.

The Description.




The Place.
These two kinds of Trefoyles, do grow in all places of this Country, in
meadows, especially such as stand somewhat high.

Trifolium pratense.


The Time.
The three leaued grass flowreth in May and June, and sometimes all the Summer.

The Names.
This kind of Trefoyl is called in Greek (...): in Latin Trifolium pratense:
in French Treffle de pres, or Triolet: in high Douche Wisen klee; and
Fleyschblum: in base Almaigne Claueren, and Ghemeyn Claueren: in English, Meadow
Trefoyle, or Common Trefoyle.

The Nature.
The Trefoyl is cold and dry, as one may easily know by the taste thereof.

The Virtues.






Of sweet Trefoyl. Chap. xxxvij.
The Description
SVeete Trefoyl has a round holow stalk, of two or three foot long or more,
full of bows and branches. The leaves do always grow three and three
together, even as the common meadow Trefoyl, but somewhat longer, and iagged
round about like a Saw. At the top of the branches grow flowers, clustering
together in knoppes, like the flowers of the medowe or common Trefoyl, saving
that the tuftes or knappes, are not so great as the knappes of the other: after
the fading of those flowers there come little husks, or sharp poynted heads,
wherein the seed lies. All the herb, especially when it is in flower, is of a
very good smell or savor, the which as some say, loses his sent or smell
seven times a day, and recoucreth it again as long as it is growing, but being
withered and dried, it keeps still his savor, the which is stronger in a
moist and cloudy dark season, then when the wether is fair and clear.

The Place.
In this Country men sow the sweet Trefoyl in gardens, and where as it has
been once sown, it grows lightly every year of the seed which falls, In
Master Riches garden.

Lotus satiua, or Vrbana.


The Time.
This herb flowreth in July and August, during which time, the sede is ripe.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Lotus vrbana, and Lotus sa^ ^
Trifolium, and now a days Trifolium odoratum: in French Trefle odoriferant: in
high Douch Siben gezeyt: and in base Almaigne, Seven getijde cruyt, because
that seuentymes a day it loses his sweet sent and smell, and recouereth it
again. Turner calls Lotus vrbana in English, Garden or Sallet Clauer: we may
call it sweet Trefoyl, or three leaued grass.

The Nature.
Sweet Trefoyl, is temperate in heat and cold, and taking part of some little
dryness.

The Virtues.


Argema.



Of wild Zotus. Chap. xxxviij.
The Kinds.
THere is commonly found in this country, two sorts of wild Lotus or
Trefoyl, with yellow flowers, one having Coddes, and the other none.

Lotus syluestris. Wild Trefoyl. Yellow stone Clauer.


Lotus syluestris minor. Petie Clauer or stone Trefoyl.


The Description.
Lotus is a little low herb, creeping along the ground. The leaves be
somewhat like to the leaves of the common three leaued grass, or meadow
Trefoyl, almost of an aishe color. The flowers be fair and yellow, fashioned
like to the flowers of peason, but much smaller: the which decayed and fallen
away, there come up three or four round coddes, standing together one by
another, wherein is contained a round sede. The root is long and reddish.



The Place.
These two kinds of wild Lotus, or Trefoyl do grow in this Country in dry
places, along the feeldes and high ways.

The Time.
These Trefoyles are in flower, from after the month of June, all the rest of
the Summer, and in the mean season they yield their seed.

The Names.
These Trefoyles, are now called Loti syluestres, yet they be not the Lotus
syluestris of Dioscorides, the which grows very high, and has seed like to
Fenugreck.

Trefle sauuage taulne: in Brabant Steenclaueren, and Geelsteenclaueren, Wild
Claueren, and of some Vogels Vitsen. Some take it for a kind of Melilotus, and
therefore it is called in Latin Melilotus syluestris or Melilotus Germanica:
in English, The wild yellowe Lotus, the Germans Melilot, or the wild
yellowe Trefoyl.

Petit Trefle iaulne: in high Douche Geelk^ee, Kleiuer, Steenkle, and Geel
wisen klee: in base Almaigne, Cleyn steenclaueren, and Cleyn geel clauere. This
should seem to be a kind of Medica, whereof we shall speak hereafter.

they yield their coddes and seeds.

The Names.
Melilot is called in Greek (...): in Latin Melilotus, and Sertula Campana.

The first kind of these herbs, is taken at Rome and in Italy for Melilot,
and therefore is called Melilotus Italica that is to say, Italian Melilot: in
French Melilot d'Italie: and in Douche, Italiansche, or Roomsche Melilote.

The other kind is called in Shoppes of this Country, and of Almaigne
Melilotus, and is used for the same, and hereof it comes to pass that men
call it Melilotus Germanica: in French Melilot vulgaire: in base Alemaigne,
Ghemeyne, or Douche Melilote. Some do also call it Saxifraga lutea, that is
say, Yellow Saxifrage: and in high Douche, Gross steinklee: in English, The
common and best known Melilot.

The Nature.
Melilot is hoate, and partly of an astringent nature, and has part of a

color, and for the most part they grow three and three together. The which
once past, there grow up flat husks or coddes, turned round together, like a
water snayle, wherein the seed is contained, the which is flat. The root is
lean or slender, and withers or perishes in this Country, after that it
has once borne seed.

Medica, is much like ye other in stalks and leaves. The cods only be not so
flat, but longer, and sharp pointed, wherein is a sede like to ye other.



Medica or strange Trefoyl, yt which lies not alo^gst the ground, but
standeth-vpright, a foot and a half or two foot long. It has hard round
stalks, divided into diverse branches, upon the which grow meetly large leaves,
gray and thick, three upon one stem, almost like the leaves of Trefoyl or
Fenugreck, but much less. The flowers be white mixed with Crymsen or Carnation
color. All the herb, as well the stalks as leaves, is whitish, and covered with
a soft and gentle cotton, or woolly roughness.

The Place.
These kinds of Trefoyl grow in Spain. They grow not of their own kind in
this Country, but are sown in the gardens of Herboristes.

The Time.

The Virtues.
Medica is good against al hoate diseases, and impostumes that require cooling
and drying.



Of the right Trefoyle / or Treacle Clauer. Chap. xli.
The Description.
AMongst all the sorts of Trefoyles, ye same here is the largest in leaves that
we have yet seen, it has great round stalks of a foot and a half or two
foot long, full of branches, upon the which there grow always three leaves
together, upon one footestalke or stem, of a blackish color, and much
greater then the leaves of the common Trefoyl. The flowers grow from the sides
of the stalks upon long stemmes, thick tufting and clustering together,
almost like the flowers of Scabiouse, of a deep blew or sky color. The seed
is broad and rough, or a little hearie, and sharp at the end. The root is
small and slender.

The Place.

Of Hares foot / or rough Clauer. Chap.xlij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Hares foot, the great and the small, but in leaves and
figure one is like to the other.

The Description.
HAres foot has a round stalk, and rough: the leaves are very like the

Of wood Sorrel / or Sorrel de boys. Chap. xliij.
The Description.




The Place.
This herb grows in this Country in shadowie wooddes, upon the roots of
great old trees, sometimes also upon the brinkes and borders of ditches.

The Time.
This herb flowreth in April, and at the beginning of May.

Oxys.


The Names.
Oxys: in Shoppes Alleluya, of some Trifolium acetosum, and Panis Cuculi
Alimonia: in French Pain de Cocu: in high Douche Saurerklee, Buchklee,
Buchamffers, Buchbrot, Gauchklee, and Gauchgauchklee: in base Almaigne
Coeckoecks broot: in English Woodsorel, Sorel du bois, Alleluya, Cockowes

The Virtues.
Sorel du bois is good for them that have sick and feeble stomachs, for it
dries and strengthens the stomach, and stirs up appetite.



Of Grass. Chap. xliiij.
The Kinds.
A Man shall find many sorts of grass, one like another in stem, and
leaves, but not in the knoppes or ears: for one has an ear like Barley, the
other like Millet, another like Panick, another like Iuray, and such
unprofitable weeds that grow amongst corn. Some have rough prickley ears,
and some are soft and gentle, others are rough and mossie like fine down or
cotton, so that there are many sorts and kinds of grass: whereof we will
make no larger discourse, but of such kinds only, as have been used of the
Ancient Physicians, and are particularly named Agrostis and Gramen.

The Description.
THE grass whereof we shall now speak, has long rough leaves almost like
the Cane, or Pole reed, but a great deal lesser, yet much greater and brother
then the leaves of that grass which grows commonly in meadows. The helm or
stemmes are small, a foot or two long, with five or six joints, at the
uppermost of ye stalks there grow soft and gentle ears, almost like ye bushy
ears of ye Cane or Pole reed, but smaller and slenderer. The root is long
and white, full of joints, creeping hither and thither, and platted or wrapped
one with another, and putting forth new springs in sundry places, and by the
means hereof it does multiply and increase exceedinly in leaves and stalks.

The Place.
This grass grows not in meadows and low places, like the other, but in the
corn feldes, and the borders thereof, and is a noughty and hurtful weed to
corn, the which the husbandmen would not willingly have in their land, or
feeldes: and therefore they take much pain to weed, and pluck up the same.

The Names.
This grass is called in Greek (...), Agrostis, because it grows in the

Of Typha palustris. Chap. liij.
The Description.
THis herb has long, rough, thick, and almost threesquare leaves, within
filled with soft marow. Amongst the leaves sometimes grows up a long smoth
naked stalk, without knottes or joints, not hollow within, having at the top
a gray, or russet long knap or care which is soft, thick, and smooth, and
seems to be nothing else but a throm of gray wool or flocks, thick set and
thronge together. The which at length when as the said ear or knap waxes
ripe, is turned into a down, and carried away with the wind. This down or
cotton is so fine, that in some Countries they fill quishions and beds with
it, as Leonardus Fuchsius writes. The roots be hard, thick, and white, with
many hanging threddes overthwart one another, and when these roots are dry,
then they burn very well.

Typha palustris. Reed Mace, Cattes tail, or Water torche.

This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin Typha, and of the writers in
these days Typha palustris, as a difference from the other Typha, called Typha
cerealis, which is a kind of grain or corn, the which has been already
described in the fourth Chap. of this book, of some it is also called Typha
aquatica, and Cestrum morionis. in French Marteau, Masses: in high Douche
Narrenkowen, and Lies; knospen: in base Almaigne, Lisch Dodden, and Dousen.
Turner calls it in English, Reed Mace, and Cattes tail: to the which we
may join others, as Water Torche, March Betill, or Pestill, and Dunche down,
because the down of this herb will cause one to be deaf, if it happen to
fall into the ears, as Matthiolus writes. The leaves are called, Matte reed,
because they make mattes therewith, to the which they only serve when it
brings forth neither stalks nor cattes tail. like as this plant yields
his cattes tails, so likewise be the leaves not necessary to make any thing
thereof.

The Nature.
This herb is cold and dry of complexion.

The Virtues.

Arundo saccharata, or Arundo sacchari, that is to say in English, Sugar
Reed, or Sugar Cane: in French Can de succre: in Douche Suycker Riet.

Calamus odoratus, Calamus Aromaticus, Arundo odorata, altogether unknown in
shoppes, for that which they use to sell for Calamus Aromaticus, is no reed
nor root of a reed, but is the root of a certain herb like unto the Yellow
Flagge or bastard Acorus, the which root is now taken for the right Acorus.

The Nature.
The Cane Reed is hoate and dry, as Galensayth.



The Virtues.






Calamus being dronken, provoke urine, and boiled with Parsley seed, is good
against the strangnrie, the pain of the raynes, the bladder and dropsy.

of ditches and rivers.

The Time.
It brings forth his boullettes, or prickley knoppes in August.

The Names.
This herb is called in base Almaigne Rietgras, and therefore some take it for
a kind of grass which Dioscorides calls in Greek (...), Calamagrostis: in
Latin Gramen Arundinaceum: in English, Reed grass. With the which it has
no likeness, and therefore it serves better to be named Platanaria, and
likewise it is not like unto Spargamum, but it is more like that Butomon of
Theophrastus, that likewise in Greek is called (...).

Platanaria.


The Nature.
It is of a cold and dry complexion.

The Virtues.


Of Rattel grass. Chap. lvi.

English, Read Rattel.

Crista gallinacea, and Crista galli, because that in proportion of flowers and
pouches, it is like to Red Rattel: in high Douch Geel Rodel: in base Almaigne,
Geel and wit Ratele^, and of some Hanekammekens, that is to say, Hens
Commes, or Coxecombes: also yellowe or white Rattel. This may well be that
herb, whereof Pliny writes in his xviii. book, the xxviii. Chapter, and
there is called Nimmulus, the which is very hurtful to meadows.

The Nature.
Both of these herbs are cold, dry, and astringent.

The Virtues.




Of the Thistel Chameleon. Chap. lvii.

The Place.




The Names.
Chamaeleo albus, of Apuleius Carduus syluaticus, of some also Erisisceptrum,
lx^^, Carduus varinus, Carduus irinus, Carduus lacteus. Matthiolus says, that

nut, set round about full of small flowers, most commonly of a Celestial or
sky color, and in this Country they have small tippes or white marks. And
hard joining under the flowers grow five or fix small prickley leaves, set in
compass round about the stalk like a star, the which with the uppermost
part of the stem are altogether of a sky color in this Country. The root
is of ten or twelve foot long, and oftentimes so long, that you cannot draw
it up whole, as big as ones finger, full of joints by spaces, and of a
pleasant taste.



The Place.




The Time.
Both these kinds do bring forth their flowers in this Country, in June and
July.

The Names.
Eryngium: Pliny calls it also Erynge: the writers of our time call it

Dipsacum satiuum. Fullers Teasel.


Dipsacum syluestre. Wild Teasel.


by joints, and at every of the said joints, grow two great long leaves, the
which at the lower ends be so closely joined and fastened together, round
about the stalk, that it holds the water, falling either by rain or dew,
so sure, as a dishe or basin. At the top of the branches grow long, rough, and
prickle heads, set full of hooks: out of the same knops or heads, grow small
white flowers placed in Celles and Cabbins, like the honey Comb, in which
Chambers or Celles (after the falling away of the flower) is found a sede like
Fenil, but bitter in taste. The knoppes or heads are holow within, and for the
most part having worms in them, the which you shall find in cleaving the
heads. The root is long, plain, and white.

The Kinds.


The Description.
THe right Artechoke has great long broad leaves, like the leaves of our
Ladies Thistel, but blacker, greater, and without prickles, amongst the which
springs up a stalk garnished or set here and there with Cynara. Artechokes.
Cynaraealiud genus. Prickley Artechokes.
the like leaves, but smaller, bearing at the top great round scaly heads,
the which at their opening bear a purple flower or blossom, and after it
yields seed, like to the seed of our Ladies Thistel, but greater. The root
is long and gross.



They are both of one kind, and not otherwise to be accounted: for oftentimes
of the seed of one springs the other, especially the Thistell Artechoke
comes of the seed of the right Arrechoke. Which thing was very well known
of Palladius, who commanded to break the point of the seed, for because it
should not bring forth the prickley kind.

The Place.
These two kinds grow not in this Country of their own accord, but are
sown and planted in gardens.

Englished, the Thistel or prickley Artichoke.

The Nature and Virtues.
De Alimentis and of hard digestion, wherefore they engender noughtie humors,
especially being eaten raw and unprepared. Therefore they must be boiled after
the order of Asparagus, in some good broth of beef or other flesh, then serve
them with a sause of butter or oil, salt and vinegar: some use them raw with
pepper and salt, and the powder of Coriander, and so they yield a natural
pleasant and kindly sweetness in taste. They are not used in medicine, as my
Aucthor in following Dioscorides and Galen writes.

The Kinds.
BRanke Vrsine called Acanthos in Greek, is of two sorts, as Dioscorides
says, to wit, the garden and wild Branke Vrsine.

The Description.
Acanthus has great large leaves, of a sad green color, thick and gross,
smooth, and deeply cut in, rent, or iagged by the sides or borders, like the
leaves of white Senuie, or Roquet. The stalk is long, of the bigness of ones
finger, covered with long, little, and sharp poynted leaves, even all along
up to the top: amongst the leaves do grow fair white flowers, and after
them broad husks, wherein is found a yellowish seed. The roots be long and
slymie.

Acanthus is like to the wild Thistell, rough and prickley, but smaller then
the aforesaid, as Dioscorides writes. It is of leaves, flowers, and seed,
growing upward, like unto the tame.

The Place.
Branke Vrsine grows in gardens, and in moist stony places, as Dioscorides
says. In this Country it is found but only in the gardens of Herboristes.

The Time.
The garden Branke Vrsine, flowreth in this Country in July and August, and
sometimes later.

Acanthus satiuus. Branke Vrsine.


The Names.
Acanthus, and Acantha, of some Paederota, Herpacantha, Melamphyllon, Topiaria,

Bearefoote, as some have taken it.

Acanthus syluestris, that is to say, the wild Acanthus.

The Nature.
The root of Acanthus is dry, and temperate in heat.

The Virtues.
Acanthus taken in drink, do provoke urine and stop the belly. They be
excellent for such as be troubled with crampes or drawing together of sinews,
and for such as be broken, and those that have the Ptysike or consumption, or
consuming fever.



Acanthus has the same virtue.

Of Douch Branck vrsine. Chap. lxvi.

red flower without stem.

Leucacantha. Carlina. White Caroline Thistel.


Spina Arabica. Carlina minor. The Arabian thistel, or the lesser Caroline.


The Description.


leaves, immediately from the root without stalke', almost lying hard by the
ground. The root is reddish, and of a strong smell.

The Place.




The Time.
These two kinds of Carline do flower in July and August.

The Names.
Acantha leuce, as Dioscorides writes) of some it is called Polygonatum,
Phyllon, and Ischias, of the Ancient Romans Spina alba: now they call it
Carlina, or Carolina, because of Charlemaigne Emperor of the Romans, unto
whom an Angel first showed this Thistel, as they say when his army was stricken
with the pestilence: some call it also Cardopatium: in French, Carline: in
high Douche, Eberwurtz, Grosz Eberwurtz, and Waisz Eberwurtz: in base Almaigne,
Euerwortele, Wit Euerwortele, and Carlina.

Petite Carline: in high Douch, Klein Eberwurtz: and in base Almaigne according
to the same it is called Euerwortele, and Cleyne Carlina. Some learned Friars
of Rome do think it to be that Thistel, which is called in Greek (...): in
Latin Spina Arabica, of some Acanthis, and of the Arabian Physicians Suchaha.

The Nature.
The root of Carline is hoate in the first degree, and dry in the third.

Rheumes and Catarrhes upon the lunges and inward parts, so that it be eaten.
Cooper says that Leucacantha is a kind of Thistel with white prickle leaves,
called in English, Saint Marie Thistel. Wherein he has followed Matthiolus, if
theirallegations be true, this place is to be amended. Seek for Matthiolus
Carlina in the Chapter Chameleon, where as here cites the tale of the Emperor
Charlemaigne. The figures here expressed, Matthiolus uses to Chameleon, and to
Leucacantha, he has given the figure of Saint Marie, or our Ladies Thistel,
whereof we have before written. Chapt. 63.

Of Wild Caroline. Chap. lxviij.
The Description.
THis Thistel has long narrow leaves, deeply cut upon both edges or sides, and
prickley, much like to the leaves of Carlina: from the midst of which leaves

leaves as are before described, at the top whereof grow three or four round
heads or more, set full of sharp prickles like the husks of the Chestnut, the
which at their opening do spread very broad in the middle, and about the
roundnesse thereof it bears little pale yellowish leaves which is the flower.
To conclude, the knoppes with their prickles, flowers, and seed, do much
resemble the heads or knoppes of Caroline, saving they be smaller and paler
turning toward yellowe. The root is small and hoate upon the tongue.

The Place.
This Thistel grows in this Country, in rude vntoyled places, about the high
ways.

The Time.
It flowreth in July and August.

Carlina syluestris.


The Names.
This Thistel is called in high Douch, Dreydistel, Frauwen Distel, and Seuw
Distel, and in base Almaigne likewise, Dryedistel. It should seem, that this

small as the Lentil leaves, whitish, and somewhat mossie or heary, set in rewes,
directly aunswering one leaf against another, all along a small twigge or
slender branche, neither greater nor less, but like the boughs and leaves of
Lentilles. The flower is also like the blowing of ye Lentil, but much smaller,
almost like the blossom or flower of Ciche peason, whitishe, and sometimes
marked with purple lines or strakes. The seed is enclosed in small husks,
almost like to the wild Lotus or Trefoyl. The whole plant on every side is set
full of sharp prickley thorns, hard white and strong. The root stretches it
self along, in length under the ground, like to the root of the common
Liquerise, yellowe within, and black without, tough and limmer, and hard to

Of Ficus Indica. Chap. lxxxi.
THis strange kind of plant comes forth of one leaf set in the ground,
and sometimes it grows high, and is named of Pliny Opuntia, now in these
days Ficus Indica.

That Euphorbium comes forth likewise of one leaf, but yet it is separated
from this kind, for the leaves of Euphorbium be long, round, and thick,
fasshioned like unto Cucumbers, set on the sides with thorns. Of that
Euphorbiu^ writes Ioannes Leo in his history of Aphrica, and is spoken of
before in the second part of this book in ye cxvj. Chap.

Of Buprestis. Chap. lxxxij.
THis Worm is called in Greek (...) and in Latin Buprestis, in some places
of the low Country he is called Veemol. And is called Buprestis, because it
is hurtful to cattle, as namely unto Oxen and kyen. And is found in certain
places of Holland, and likewise sometimes in Brabant, and Flaunders: where the
kyen sometimes are bitten of them.

This worm is of the kind of Scarabeen or Horswormes, the which are named
Cantharides, or Spanishe Flies, and has wings like unto these, and is of
form and bigness such as the figure does show. And this figure have we set
here, because that some have set forth another worm, not like unto the true
Buprestis.

The Description.


There is also another kind of Garden Orache, whose leaves, stalks, and
flowers, be of a brown red color, but in all things else like to the leaves,
stalks and flowers of the white Orache both in bigness and proportion.



Of this wild kind, there is also found another sort, the which grows not
very high, but remains low, and spread abroad into many branches. It has
little long narrow leaves nothing snipt or creuished about. The flowers,
seed, and roots are very much like unto the wild kind before described.

Orache is cold in the first degree, and moist in the second, especially
garden Orache, the which is more colder and moyster, than the wild Orache.

The Virtues.








The Danger.
The often use of Orache engenders many infirmities, ouerturneth the stomach,
and causes diverse spots, freckles, or pimples to artse in the face, and all
the rest of the body. Also it is hard of digestion, as says Diocles, and
Dionysius.

Of Blites. Chap. ij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Blites, the great and the small, and every of them is
divided again into two kinds, whereof the one is white, and the other read,
and does common in this Country.

The Description








Blitum maius. The great Blite. Blitum rubeum. The red Blite. Blitum album. The
white Blite.


The Place.
This herb grows wild, and in some gardens amongst pot herbs, and where as
it has once taken root, it comes up every year, wherefore it is counted
but a weed, or unprofitable herb.

The Time.
It is found most commonly in flower about midsomer.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Blitum: in French, Blette,
and Pouree rouge: in high and base Almaigne, Maier: in English, Blite, and

savor, we do call it in Greek (...) * in Latin Tragium, that is to say,
Goats herb. And because you shall read in Dioscorides of two other herbs
called Tragia, to make some difference betwixt them, we do name this Tragium
Germanicum: in French, Blanch putain: in base Almaigne, Bocxcruyt: some call
it Vuluaria, by which name it is known of the Herboristes of this Conntrie:
Valerius Cordus calls it Garosmos: I have named it in English, The rank

(...), Agriocastanon, whereunto it is very much like: for the root is like
Bulbus, and in taste it is much like to the Chestnut: in consyderation

top of the stalks, and are the fairest amongst all the sorts of Mallows,
almost like in making to the flowers of the other Mallows, divided also into
five leaves, the extremity and outside of the leaves are white or pale, but
the middle or inner part of the flower is of a brown red purple, with a
yellowe Dodkin or Pestil, like gold in the middle. These flowers do not open
at all until three or four hours after son rising, or an hour or two

abroad the space of an hour, or an hour and a half, they close together
again, and fade or wither away, the which being past, there come in their
steed little husks or bladders, wherein are small knoppes, or hearie
pellettes, in which is a black seed. The root is small and tender, and
perishes yearly, so that it must be new sown every year.

Alcea Veneta.


The Place.
This herb is a stranger in this Country, and is not found at all except in
the gardens of some Herboristes, where as it is sown.

The Time.
They sow it in March or April, and it flowreth in June and July.

of the third book, whereunto it resembles much.

The Nature.
The Mucculage Mallowe is hoate and moist, like to the common Hocke or great
wild Mallow, we may well presume, that in operation and virtue it is like to
the common Mallow, yet for all that we have no certain experience of the same.

THe round Rape or turnep at the beginning has great rough broad leaves,
which leaves in the end next the stem, are deeply cut and iagged upon both
sides: and toward winter, it will have a round stalk, upon the which grow
small yellow flowers, which bring forth small brown seed in little coddes or
husks like Colewurtes, to which the Rapes are much like in flowers, husks,
and seed. The root is round and thick, white both without and within,
sometimes as great as a man's head, sometimes no bigger then ones fiste, and
sometimes smaller.

There is another kind of Turnep or Rape, yet not that sort, which some men
call the red Rape or Nauew, whereof we have already spoken in ye Chapt. of
Beetes: but another kind very like to the round Rape or turnep aforesaid, in
rough leaves, stalks, flowers, coddes, and seeds: and and differs but only
in this, that his roots or Turneppes are not white but red, in all things else
like to the other, as I understand by some Herboristes, who have declared unto
me, that the noble and famous Queen Douager of Hungary and Bohem, does cause
them to be set and planted in her most rich and pleasant gardens.

Rapa.


The Place.
The Turnep loves an open place, it is sown somwhere in vineyardes, as at
Huygarden and the Country theraboutes, which do wax very great: but they are
most commonly sown in feeldes, especially when the corn is ripe, but they
become nothing so great.

The Time.
They are sown at the beginning of summer, that they may wax great: and in
July and August after the cutting down of corn: but the later sowing are
never very great, and about April when summer is at hand, they bring forth
stalks, and flowers. The seed is ripe in May and June.

The Names.
Rapes are called in Greek (...): in Latin, Rapae: in French, Naneaux: in
high Douch, Ruben: in base Almaigne, Rapen: in English, Rapes and Turnips.

body, the seed dronken is of the same virtue, the seed is also put into
medicines, that are made for the beautifying of the face, and all the body, as
Dioscorides, Galen, and other approved aucthours testify. Rapes have also a
marvelous properrie to clear the eyesight, as Auerrois the Philosopher (but
enemy unto Christ) writes.

The Kinds.
THere be two kinds of Radish, the tame, and the wild, whereof the tame or
garden Radish is of two sorts, the one with a round root, like the Nauew or
garden Rape, and is not very common in Brabant. The other has a very long
white root and is the common Radish of this Country. To this may be joined a
third kind of garden or tame Radishe, with the black root which of late
years has been brought into England, and now begins also to wax common.

The Description.


The wild Radishe has leaves like the common Radishe, but smaller and fuller
of cuttes or iagges. The stalk is of a foot and a half long, or more, upon
which grow many yellow flowers, and afterward small husks, wherein the seed,
which is very small, is enclosed. The root is as big as ones finger, in taste
very like to a young Radishe, but stronger.

The Nature.




The Virtues.
Radish is now eaten with other meats, as they used in times past,
Nevertheless it is rather medicine then meat or nourishment, as witnesses
Galen: for it gives very little or no nourishment to the body, seeing that it is
sharp and biting upon the tongue.















Plistonicus, and Praxagoras writes.

















Of Raifort or mountain Radish. Chap. xxxvij.
The Description.
Mountain Radish or Rayfort has great broad leanes, in fashion like to the
great Docke, called Patience, but greater and rougher. The stalks be tender,
short, and small, at the top whereof are small white flowers, and after them
very small husks, wherein is the seed. The root is long and thick of a very
sharp taste, and biting upon the tongue: and therefore it is pound or stamped
very small to be eaten with meats, and specially fish in steed of Mustarde.

The Place.
It is found for the most part planted in gardens, and where as it has been
once set, it remains a long season without perishing.

The Time.
The great Raifort springs up in April, and flowreth in June.

The Names.
This herb is called of the later writers, Raphanus magnus, and Raphanus
montanus: in French, Grand Raifort, and Raphanus: in high Douche, Meerretich,

the learned sort of the later writers do take it for (...), Raphanus, of the
Ancient Atheniens, the which as some write, is an enemy to the vine, but
this is not (...) of Theophrast, or of the other Greeks their successors: Who
take for Raphanus, Brassica Romanorum, which is our common Colewurtes. Some
others judge it to be Thlaspi, whereof Cratenas writes, but their opinion is
nothing like to the truth.

Raphanus magnus.


The Nature.
The great Rayfort is hoate and dry almost in the third degree, especially
the root, in which is the cheifest virtue.

The Virtues.

Orioselinon.

The Description.

which they name Mountain Parsely. And albeit it be now grown out of
knowledge, yet we have thought it good to describe the same, to the intent that
nothing should fail of that, which apparteyneth to the kinds of Parsely,
also we hope that this Parsely shall be the sooner found, because we do here
express it by name. This Parsely, as writes Dioscorides, has small tender
stalks of a span long, having little branches, with small spokie tops or
crownets, like to Hemlocke, but much smaller, upon the which grows a little
seed somewhat long, like to the seed of Commin, small, of a very good and

much unlike the seed of the garden Parsely, but better, and of an aromaticall
savor, and sharper taste. The root is small with many hearie stringes hanging
thereat.

The Place.
This kind which is the right Parsely, grows plentifully in Macedonia, in
rough stony and vntoyled places, and also in some places of Douchland, that be
likewise rough stony and vntoyled. The Hetboristes of this Country do sow it

kernel of an Orange) of a spicie savor and bitterishe taste. The root is
white within, and black without, which being taken forth of the ground, and
broken in pieces puts forth a thick liquer, or oily gum of a yellowishe
color, in taste very bitter and like to Myrrh.

Of water Parsley. Chap. xlvij.
The Kinds.
THere is found in this Country two kinds of this herb, one great, the
other small, the which do differ but only in figure, and that is long of the
diversity of the places where as it grows, for the one is changed into the
other, when as it is removed from one place to another. That is to say, that
which grows always in the water, becomes small being planted upon the land
or d^ie ground: and on the contrary, that which grows upon the dry land
becomes great, being planted in the water: so that to say the truth, these
two herbs are but all one, which does not only happen to this herb, but also
to diverse others, that grow in the waters or moist meadows.

The Description.

Without doubt this herb is of complexion hoate and dry, and in virtue like
to the other Sium.

Of Bastard Parsley. Chap. xlviij.

top of the stalks grow small spoky tuffets or rundels like Dyll, with yellowe
flowers, and after them a small black seed, like the seed of Colewurtes, it
is sharp and bitter in taste like Myrrh. The root is of a good length,
plain, and full of juice, of a good small and sharp taste, black without and
white within.

The Place.
Smyrnium, as says Dioscorides, grows in Cilicia upon the mount Amanus, in
stony rough and dry ground, but now some dilligent Herboristes do sow it in
their gardens.

wild Carrot, saving that his leaves be tenderer, thicker set, and cut into
smaller thrommes, or iagged frenges, and the stalks be slenderer and playner,
and the whole herb is neither rough nor hearie as the wild Carrot is, but
plain and smothe and of a bitter taste. The flowers be white and grow upon
spokie tops or tuftes like the wild Carrot: after them comes the seed,
the which being ripe, the stems with their spokie tuftes become stiff, and
wax strong and hard, like small staves or little sticks, and the spokes or
little sticks of the tuft of this herb, the Italians and Spaniardes do use

The Virtues.
Scandix eaten is good and wholesome for the stomach and belly, and in times
past has been a common herb amongst the Greeks, but of small estimation and
value, and taken but only for a wild wurt or herb. Aristophanes in times
past by occasion of this herb taunted Euripides, saying, that his mother was
not a seller of wurtes or good potherbes, but only of Scandix, as Pliny
writes.



Of Myrrhis Casshes or Caxes. Chap. liij.

three foot long: at the top of the stalks grow rundels, or spokie tuftes
with white flowers, and after them comes a long seed. The root is long and
round, not much differing in taste and savor from Carrot. The whole herb,
but especially the first leaves are beset with a soft down or fine hear, and
are in smell and savor much like to Cheruil, and therefore it is called in base
Almaigne wild Keruel, that is to say, Wild Cheruel.

The Place.

Cicutaire, or Persil d'asne: in high Douche, Wilder Korffel: in base Almaigne,
Wild Keruel: in English, as Turner says, Casshes, or Caxes, because

Caxes, to wind yarne upon, it may be called also wild Cheruell, or mock
Cheruill.

The Nature.
Myrrhis, especially the root is hoate in the second degree, and of subtle

soft hears, wherewithal the garden Asparagus is covered, this has nothing else
but thorns, very small, hard, short, and prickley, wherwithal the branches are
furnished.

The Place.
Asparagus grows in Burgundy and some other Countries as in Almaigne, in
stony places, where as is good earth, and fat ground: in this Country it is
planted in the gardens of Herboristes.

The Place.
Charlocke grows in all places along the ways, about old walls and
ruynous places and oftentimes in the feeldes, especially there, where as
Turneppes and Nauewes have been sown, so that it should seem to be a corrupt

in steed of Mustarde: whereby it is evident that the seed of this herb does
not much differ from Senuie in virtue and operation, and that it may be taken
in steed thereof, although it be not al thing so good, and therefore it was
reckoned of Theophrast and Galen amongst those seeds, wherewithal men used
commonly to prepare and dress their meats.

common Hysope, but much longer, and somewhat larger. The stalks be round of
two foot high, parted into many branches, upon which grow many small knoppes
or little buttons, the which at their opening show many small flowers, as
yellowe as gold intermingled with black. They being past comes the seed.
The root is long and small, very threddy creeping along the ground hither
and thither, and puts forth yearly here and there new stalks and
springes. Ruellius in his second book Chap. xcvj. says, that this herb
comes of Lineseede put into a Radish root, or within the scale of the sea
Onyon, called Scylla in Latin, and so set into the ground and planted, and
therefore he says, it has part of both their natures, for it draws partly
toward vinegar, and partly toward salt, as may be judged by the taste.

The Place.
Tarragon is planted in gardens, but yet it is not very common.

The Time.
Tarragon abides green, from the month of March, almost to winter, but it
flowreth in July.

The Names.
This herb has not been written of by any learned man before Ruellius time,
neither is it yet well known, but in some places of England, France, and
certain Towns of this Country, as Anwarpe, Bruxelles, Malines, etc. where as
it was first brought out of France. And therefore it has none other name, but
that which was given first by the Frenchemen, who called it Targon, and
Dragon: and according to the same it is called in Latin, Draco: and of some
Dracunculus hortensis: that is the little Dragon of the garden: it is also
called in English, Tarragon, which should seem to be borrowed from the
French, nevertheless it was allowed a Denizon in England long before the time
of Ruelius writing.

Draco.


The Nature.
All this herb is hoate and burning in the mouth and upon the tongue, whereby
it is certain that it is hoate and dry in the third degree, and in
temperature much like to Rockat.

The Virtues.


Of Cresses. Chap. lix.
The Description.
GArden Cresses have small narrow iagged leaves, of a sharp burning taste:
the stalks be round of a foot long, and bring forth many small white
flowers, and after them little round flat husks, within which the seed is
contained of abrowne reddish color.

The Place.
Cresses are commonly sown in all gardens of this Country.

The Time.
Cresses that are timely sown, bring forth their seed bytime, but that
which is later sown, brings forth flowers and seeede more lately.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Nasturtium of some later
writers Cressio: in French, Cresson alnoys, or Nasitort: in high Douche, Kresz
and Garten Kresz: in base Almaigne, Kersse: in English, Cresses, Town Kars, or
Town Cresses.

The Nature.
Cresses are hoate and dry almost in the fourth degree, especially the seed,
and the herb when it is dry: for being but yet green they do not heat nor
dry so vehemently, but that they may be eaten with bread, as Galen says.

The Virtues.










Nasturtium.






Of water Cresses. Chap. lx.
The Kinds.
Water Cresses are of two sorts, great and small.

The Description.




The Place.

Sisymbrium alterum cardamine. Small watercresse.
overwhelmed and drenched with water in the winter season, also in standing
waters and diches.

The Time.




The Names.
Nasturtium aquaticum: and seems very well to be that Sium of the which
Cratenas makes mention, in English, Water Kars, and Water Cresse.

Sisymbrium alterum cardamine: of some also Sium: in French, Passerage
sauuage, or Petit Cresson aquatique: in high Douch, Gauchblum, wilder Kresz,
and Wisen Kresz: in base Almaigne, Coeckoecxbloemen, and Cleyn Waterkersse: of
the Herboristes, Flos cuculi, of some Nasturtium aquaticum: in English, the
lesser Watercresse, and Coccow flowers. This is no Iberis as some have deemed
it.

The Nature.
These two herbs are hoate and dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.








Of winter Cresses. Chap. lxi.
The Description.
THIS herb has green gross leaves, broad, smooth, and somewhat round, not
much unlike the leaves of Smallage, or garden Rape, but greater and larger
the^ Smallage leaves. The stalks be round and full of branches above bringing
forth many little yellow flowers, and after them long round coddes, wherein is
enclosed a little seed. The root is thick and long.

The Place.
This herb grows in the feeldeg, and sometime also in gardens of potherbes,
and places not toyled or husbanded.

The Time.
This herb is green most commonly all the winter, but it flowreth and seedeth
in May and June.

The Names.
This herb is called in Douche S. Barbarakraut: and according to the same in
Latin, Sanctae Barbar herba: we have named it Barbaraea: the Frenchmen, Herb
de S. Barbe: in some places of Brabant they call it Steencruyt, because it is
good against the stone and grauel: in Holland and other places Winterkersse,
because they do use to eat of it in the winter time in salades, in steed of
Cresses, and therefore it is called Nasturtium, or Cardamum hybernum. This
seems to be (...), Pseudobunium of Dioscorides: for surely this is not
Sideritis latifolia, or Scopa regia, as some do take it: Herb Sainbarbe

Pseudobunium. Barbaraea.


The Nature.
This herb is hoate and dry in the second degree.

The Virtues.




Pseudobunium.

Kersse: it may be also called in English, Thlaspi.

Scordothlaspi: that is to say, Garlikethlaspi.

Thlaspi minus. Besom grass.


Nasturtium rusticum, and Sinapi rusticum: in high Douche, Baurn seuff, or
Baurn Kresz, and the nether Douchmen in following the same call it, Boeren
mostaert, or Boeren kersse, that is to say, Seneui, or Carles Cresse: or
Churles Cresse: Turner calls Thlaspi, treacle mustarde, Bowers mustarde, or
dishe mustarde: but I think it best next to Thlaspi, which is the Greek name
to call it Churles mustarde, both because of the strong and violent nature of
this noughtie plant, as also in respect of the Boures, who began to be more
mischievous to the state of their Country, then this herb is to man's nature.

Thlaspi angustifolium, and Thlaspi minus: in high Douche, Bysemkraut: in base
Almaigne Bessemcruyt: that is to say, Bessem weed, or ye herb serving for
Bysoms. Turner calls this Iberis Dioscoridis.

Thlaspi, but it has no other particular name.

The Nature.
Thlaspi, especially the seed thereof, is hoate and dry almost in the fourth
degree.

The Virtues.
The seed of the first Thlaspi eaten, purges choler, both upward and
downewarde, it provoke women's flowers, and breaks inward impostumes.



The Danger.

July.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Irio: of some (...):
Chamaeplion. This is the Erysimum of Dioscorides, and not of Theophrastus, for
the Erysimum of Theophrastus, is not all one with that of Dioscorides, as we
have sufficiently declared elsewhere. Cooper Englisheth Irio: by the name of
winter Cresses.

The Nature.
Erysimon is hoate and dry like Cresses.

The Virtues.






Of Iberis. Chap. lxv.

much unlike the Baye tree leaf, but a great deal larger and longer, and a
little natched or toothed about like a saw. The stalks and branches be round,
uneasy or hard to be broken, and about two foot high: at the top whereof
grow a number of small white flowers, and after them a small seed. The root
is long and single creeping under the earth, and puts forth yearly in
diverse places new springes and leaves.

The Place.
Dittany is sown in some gardens of this Country, and where as it has been
once set, it abides or continues well, so that afterward it cannot be easily
destroyed.

The Time.
Dittany flowreth and is in Seed in June and July.

The Names.
This herb is called of the later writers in these days, in Latin,
Piperitis, of some also Syl^estris Raphanus: in French, Passerage: in high
Almaigne, Pfefferkraut: in base Almaigne, Pepercruyt: This should seem to be
(...), Lepidium, of Paulus Aegineta, and of Pliny: yet for all that, this is
not Lepidium of Dioscorides, neither yet Plinies Piperitis, although it be of
some men, sometimes so called: it is fondly and unlearnedly named in English,
Dittany. It were better in following the Douchemen to call it Pepperwurt.

Piperitis.


The Nature.
This herb is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Virtues.
Piperitis.

THere be three sorts of this Pepper, the one with husks of a mean length
and greatness, the others husks be long and narrow, and the third has short
broad husks in all things else not much unlike one another, in figure and manner
of growing.

Capsiacum. Indian Pepper.


Capsiacum oblongius. Long Indian Pepper.


The Description.
THe Indian Pepper has square stalks somewhat brown of a foot high, upon
which grow brownish leaves, smooth and tender, almost like to the leaves of
common Morrel or Nightshade, but narrower and sharper poynted. Amongst the
leaves grow flowers, upon short stemmes, with five or six small leaves, of
color white, with a green star in the middle. After the flowers come smooth

diligence.

The Time.
The seed of this Pepper is ripe in this Country in September and before
winter.

Capsicum latum. Large Pepper of Indie.


The Names.
This strange herb is called of Actuarius in Greek (...): in Latin,
Capsicum: of Auicen, Zingiber caninu^: of Pliny after the opinion of some men,
Siliquastrum, and Piperitis: of such as write in these days, Piper Indianum
Piper Calecuthium, and Piper Hispanum: in high Douche, Indianischer Pfeffer,
Calecutischer Pfeffer: in French, Poyure d'Inde, or d' Espaigne: in base
Almaigne, Peper van Indien, and Bresilie Peper: in English, Indian Pepper, or
Calecute Pepper.

The Nature.
The Indian Pepper is hoate and dry in third degree.

The Virtues.




The Danger.
It is dangerous to be often used or in to great a quantity: for this Pepper
has in it a certain hidden evil quality, whereby it kills Dogs, if it
be given them to eat.

Of Pepper. Chap. lxx.
The Kinds.
THe old and ancient Physicians do describe and set forth there kinds of
Pepper, that is to say, the long, the white, and the klacke Pepper, ye which a
man shall even in these days find to be sold in the shops of the Apothecaries
and Grossers.

The Description.
AS touching the proportion and figure of the tree or plant that bears
Pepper, we have nothing else to write, saving that we have found described of
the Auncientes, and such as have trauayled into India, and the Countries about
Calecute: and because this is a strange kind of of fruit, not growing amongst
us, we will write no more thereof, but as we have gathered from the writings
of the Ancientes, and others, which lately have trauayled into those Countries,
who notwithstanding be not yet all of one mind or opinion: for Pliny writes
that the tree which bears Pepper is like to our Juniper: Philostratus says,
the Pepper tree with his fruit, is like to Agnus castus. Dioscorides with
certain others do write, ye Pepper grows in India upon a little or small tree.
And that the long Pepper (the which is like to the knoppes or agglettes that
hang in the Birche or Hasell trees before the coming forth of the leaves) is
as it were the first fruit which comes forth immediately after the flowers,
the which also in process of time do wax long, great and white bringing
forth many berries hanging together, upon one and the self same stem. The
which berries being yet unripe, are the white Pepper. and being ripe and black
is our common black Pepper. Such as travel to the Indians, Calecute, and the
Countries there aboutes do say, that Pepper grows not upon trees, but upon a
plant like Iuie or Bindweede, the which does twist and wrap it self about
trees and hedges, bringing forth long weak stemmes, where upon hang the
Pepper corns or berries, even like the Ribes, or beyondsea Gooseberries, as ye
may see in this Country: for Pepper is brought from the Indians to Anwarpe
preserved in comsiture with the stems, and foot stalks hanging in it. The
green and unripe berries, remain white, and it is that we call white Pepper,
but when they be through ripe they wax black, and full of shriueled
wrinckles, and that is our common black Pepper. The same aucthours or later
trauaylers do affirm, that long Pepper is not the fruit of this plant, but
that it grows upon other trees, like the things that you see hanging like
Cattes tails, or Agglettes, upon the Nut trees and Birche trees in the winter,
the which fruit they call long Pepper, because in taste and working it is like
Pepper.

The Place.
Pepper grows in the Isles of the Indian seas, as Taprobane Sumatra, and
certain other Islands adjoining, from which Islands it is brought to Calecute,
the which is the most famous and cheifest city, as also the greatest mart
town of the Indians: and there it is sold not by weight, but by measures as
they sell corn in this Country.

The Names.
Pepper is called in Greek (...): Latin, Piper in high Douche, Pfeffer: in
base Almaigne, Peper: and in English, Pepper.

Piper longum: in Shoppes, Macropiper.

Piper album: in Shoppes, Leucopiper.

Piper nigrum: in Shoppes, Melanopiper.

The Nature.
Pepper is hoate and dry in the third degree, especially the white and the
black, for the long Pepper is not so dry, because it is partaker of a
certain moisture.

The Virtues.






The same licked in with honey, is good against the cough coming of a cold
cause, and against all the cold infirmities of the breast and lunges.









Of Garlike. Chap. lxxi.

Garlike, and Ramsons.

Allium satiuum. Garden Garlike.


Allium syluestre. Crow Garlike.


Allium vrsinum. Ramsons.


The Description.


Bulbus fashion, without cloves or kernelles growing in it, yet sometimes it
has joined thereunto new heads or or roots, from which spring new plants.

Of this sort is found another kind which is smaller, in all things else
like the other, as well in leaves, or blades, stemmes, and seed, as also in
roots, the which do grow most commonly in meadows.

Allium vrsinum. Ramsons.


Liricumphancy, or May Lyllies: betwixt which comes up a stem or twain,
bearing many small white flowers. The root is like to a young Garlyke head, of
a very rank savor and taste.

The Place.






The Time.




The Names.
Garlyke is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Allium: in high Douche,
Knobloch, or Knoblouch: in base Almaigne. Loock.

Allium satiuum: in English, Garden Garlyke, and poor men's treacle: in
French, Ail de iardin: in Douche, Tam Loock, or Loock.

Allium anguinum, and Allium syluestre: in French, Ail sauuage in high Douche,
Wilder Knobloch, or feld Knobloch: in base Almaigne, Wilt Loock: in English,
Crow Garlike, and wild Garlike.

Allium vrsinum: in French, Ail d'ours: in high Douch, Waldt knoblauch: in
base Almaigne, Das Loock: in English, Ramsons, Buckrammes, and Bears Garlike.
This should seem to be that Garlyke, which Dioscorides calls
Scorodoprassum, or as some others think Ampeloprasum.

The Nature.
Garlyke is hoate and dry almost in the fourth degree.

The Virtues.
































The Danger.
Garlyke is hurtful and naught for cholerique people, and such as be of a
hoate complexion, it hurts the eyes and sight, the head and kidneyes. It is
also naught for women with child and such as give suck to children.

Of Sauwce alone or Jack by the hedge. Chap. lxxij.
The Description.
THis herb at his first springing up, has roundish leaves, almost like to
March violettes, but much greater and larger, and of a paler color. Amongst
those leaves comes up the stalk of two foot high, with longer and narrower
leaves then the first were, and creuised or iagged about, not much unlike the
Nettle leaves, but greater. The which being bruised between the fingers, have
the savor and smell of Garlyke. About the highest of the stalk grow many
small white flowers, and after them long coddes or husks wherein is black
seed. The root is long and slender, and of woody substance.

The Place.
This herb delights to grow in low vntoyled places, as about the borders
of meadows, and moist pasture grounds, and sometimes in hedges, and upon walls.

The Time.
This herb flowreth most commonly in May and June, and afterward comes the
seed.

Alliaria.


The Names.
This herb is called of the later writers in the Latin tongue, Alliaria, of
some also Scordotis: but this is not the true Scordotis, the which is also
called Scordium, and is described in the first book of this history:
Pandectarius calls it Pes Asininus: it is named in French, Alliaire: in high
Douch, Knoblochkraut, Leuchel, or Saszkraut: in base Almaigne, Loock sonder
loock: in English, Sauce alone, and Jack by the hedge.

The Nature.
This herb is hoate and dry almost in (the third degree) fourth degree.

The Virtues.


Scordium, not without error, as it is manifest to all such as are learned in
ye knowledge of Simples.

Of Onyons. Chap. lxxiij.
The Kinds.
THere be diverse sorts of Onyons, some white, some red, some long, some
round, some great, and some small: but al of one savor and property, saving
that the one is a little stronger then the other. Yet they differ not in leaves,
flowers, and seed.

The Description.
THe Onyon has leaves or blades almost like garlike, holow within. The stemmes
be round, upon which grow round bawles or heads, covered with little fine or
tender white skins, out of which break many white flowers like stars,
which turn into small pellettes or buttons, in which are contained two or
three black cornered seeds. The root is round or long, made of many foldes,
pylles, or coueringes, growing one upon another, whereof the vpmost pills or
scales are thinnest. In the nether part of the root is a bearde of hearie
roots, or stringes like a tassel.

The Place.
They are sown in every garden of this Country, but they love a soft and
gentle ground.

The Time.
They are commonly sown in February and March, and are full grown in August,
and are then plucked out of the ground to be kept. And if they be planted again
in December, January, or February, then they will blow in June, and bring forth
in July and August.

The Names.
The Onyon is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Cepa, and Cepe: in high Douche,
Zwibel: in base Almaigne, seed Ayeuyn.

The Nature.
The Onyon is almost hoate in the fourth degree, and rather of gross, then
subtle parts.

Crommion, Cepa. Onyons.


The Virtues.






















The Danger.
The often use of Onyons, causes headache, and ouermuche sleep, and is
hurtful to the eyes.

Of Leekes. Chap. lxxiiij.
The Description.
THE Leeke has long broad blades, folden together with a keele or crest in the
backside, in taste and savor not much unlike the Onyon, betwixt which leaves
in the second year grows a round stem, which brings forth a round
head or bawle, with his flowers like the Onyon, and after the flowers it
bears seed, in fashion like to Onyon seed, but that it is of a grayishe
color. The root is white and lesser then a mean Onyon, with a bearde or
tassell of hearie stringes.

The Place.
The Leeke is planted almost in every garden of this Country, and is but
seldom suffered to seed: but the blades are cut almost every day hard by the
ground, to be daily used in pottages, and other meats, and therefore it can
vnethe or scarsely grow up.

The Time.
The Leeke flowreth in May and June, a year after the sowing, if it has not
been cut, for if it be continually cut, it bears very seldom flowers or
seed, and therefore some do write that the Leeke brings forth neither
flowers nor seed, which is untrue, for the Leeke which has not been cut
brings forth both flowers and seed.

Porrum.


The Names.
The Leeke is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Porrum: in French, Poureau.
in high Douche, Lauch: in base Almaigne, Paraye: in English, a Leeke, or
Leekes.

The uncut Leeke is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Porrum capitatum: that
to say in English, the headded or knopped Leeke.

The cut Leeke is called of Columella and of Palladius in Latin, Porrum
sectiuum: in English, French Leeke, unset Leeke, Maiden Leeke.

The Nature.
The Leeke is hoate and dry in the third degree, of Nature like the Onyon, but
not so strong.

The Virtues.
dreams, especially to be eaten raw: but boiled in water twice or thrice, it
will be the better and more convenient to be eaten.















The Danger.
Leekes engender evil humors, and windiness: they cause heavy and terrible
dreams, they darken the eye sight, and are very hurtful for them that have any
exulcerations or going of, of the skin, of the bladder, or raynes.

Of Cyues / or Rushe Onions Leekes. Chap. lxxv.
The Description.
CYues or Rushe Onyons, in the steed of leaves have little, small, holowe, and
slender piped blades, like to small Rushes, growing thick together, in taste
not much unlike the taste of Leekes. Amongst the Rushlyke leaves grow small
round stemmes, with small bowls, or round knopped heads, like the bawle in
the top of the seed Onyon, but much smaller, and full of small purple flowers.
The roots be like to small Onio^s, but a great deal smaller, growing close
and thick together, full of long hearie threads or stringes, like the beard of
the Onyons, or leekes,

The Place.
It is set in gardens amongst pot herbs, or wurtes.

The Time.
It flowreth in May and June a year after ye sowing, new planting or setting.

Schoenoprasum.


The Names.
This kind of Leekes is called in English, Cyues, and of Turner in Latin,
Cepa pallacana, and in greek Gethyu^, which he Englisheth by all these names a
Cyue, a Ciuet, a Chyue, or Sweth, and gives to the same a very strange figure:
but this kind is called in French, des Oignoncettes, or Porrettes: in high
Douche, Schnitlauch, Bryszlauch: in base Almaigne, Biesloock, that is to say,
Rushe Garlike, because in steed of leaves it brings forth small rushes like
Crow Garlike. It has neither Greek nor Latin name that I know. Therefore in
following the Douche, we do call it in Greek (...): and in Latin,
Scoenoprasum: which may be Englished, Rushe Leekes: and if any man had called
it in Greek (...), I without any presumption might have called it Rushe
Onyons. Some take it to be Porrum sectiuum: but it appears well by that
which Columella and Palladius have written, how shamefully they err, and by
the same authority of Columella and Palladius we have sufficiently proved in
the former Chapter, that the cut Leeke, and the headed Leeke, which is our
common Leeke are al one, and do come both of one seed, and do differ but only
in this: that the one is suffered to grow and bear seed, and the other is
oftentimes cut.

The Nature.
Cyues are hoate and dry in the third degree, and of complexion or
temperament like unto Leekes.

The Virtues.


Of wild Bulbus / or wild Onyon. Chap. lxxvi.
The Description.
THis herb has long leaves or blades like Garlyke, but very seldom bringing
forth more the^ two blades, betwixt which springs up a round holow stem
of a spanne long at the top thereof grow many yellowe sterrelyke flowers, the
which do change into a three square or tria^gled husk or husks: in which
the seed is contained. The root is round as an Onyon.

The Place.
This Onyon grows in diverse places of Almaigne, in sandy Countries in dales
and vallyes about brooks and little streams, and sometimes also under hedges.

The Time.
This kind of Bulbus flowreth in March, and is in seed in April, and in short
space after it vanishes away, so yt in May following a man shall find neither
stalks neither leaves.

The Names.
How this kind of Bulbus has been called of the Auncientes or old writers,
is not certainly known, some think it to be Bulbina: some others would have it
(...), that is to say, Bulbus esculentus, but as some learned men and I do
think, this Bulbus is Bulbus syluestris.
neither the one nor the other. And therefore we call it Bulbus syluestris: the
high Douchemen do call it feldswibel, Ackerzwibel: and there after it is called
in base Almaigne, Velt Ayeuyn: in French, Oignon sauuage: that is to say,
Wild Onyon. Turner calls it Bulbyne, wild Leeke, and Corn Leeke, li. 1.
fo. 97. and in the first unpression. fol. 5.

The Nature.
This wild Onyon is hoate and dry in the second degree, the which is to be
perceived by his bitter taste and rough astriction, or binding quality.

The Virtues.
Bulbus in proof, do affirm that it softeneth and drives away hard
swellings being laid thereunto.



Of the white field Onyon. Chap. lxxvij.
Ornithogalum minus. Bulbus Leucanthemus.


Ornithogalum maius.


The Description.
Bulbus at the first springing up has long small narrow grassie leaves or
blades of a span long: from amongst which springs up a round green stem,
of a span long or theraboutes, bringing forth four or five small flowers,
green without and white within, not much differing in proportion from the
fashion of the Lylie flower, especially before they be fully spread abroad and
opened, but they be much lesser. The root is round like an Onyon or Bulbe,
white both within and without, and very slymie like Comfrey, when it is bruised
or broken in pieces: in taste somewhat sharp. This agrees not with
Ornithogalum of Dioscorides, for his Ornithogalum is described to have a
certain aglet, or a thing called Cachryos, growing up in the middle of the
flower: Neither is it like to be Matthiolus Ornithogalum: for that which he
sets betwixt Ornithogalum and Trasi, has a root black without and white
within.

Ornithogalum maius, is like the other, but much greater. The leaves of this be
long and small, but bigger then the first. The stalk grows a foot and a
half high, and is very even. There grow upon the top of the stalk fair
pleasant flowers, of color white, like unto small Lylies, in the middle is a
head like the seed that is named Cachrys. The root is a Bulbus* the which
lightly multiplyeth into many other.

The Place.
This herb grows in sandy places that lie open to the air, and be manured
or toyled, and is found in many places of Brabant, especially about Malines or
Mechelen almost in every feelde.

The Time.
The leaves of this Bulbus do spring up first in March and April, and the
flowers in May, and about June they do so vanish, that they be not any longer
to be seen or found.

The Names.
Ornithogalum: unknown in shoppes: in base Almaigne it is called, Wit velt
Ayueyn, that is to say, the wild white feelde Onyon: in some places of France,
it is called Churles. It may likewise be very well called, Bulbus Leucanthemus.

Bulbus, is likewise an Ornithogalum, and is called of some now in these
days, Lilium Alexandrinum, that is to say, Lylies Alexandria, because it is
thought that it is first brought into knowledge in this Country from
Alexandria.

The Nature.
This Bulbus is temperate in heat and dryness.

The Virtues.




Of the Sea Union called Squilla. Chap. lxxviij.
The Kinds.
AT this day there be found two kinds of Squilla, or Sea Union: the one bearing
straight or narrow blades, the which is the right Squilla: the other has broad
blades, and is commonly used for Squilla.

The Description.




The Place.
Squilla grows not of his own accord in this Country, but is brought from
Spain hither to serve for medicine, whereof some is planted in gardens.

The Names.
The first kind of this strange Union, is called in Greek (...): and in
Latin, Scilla: in Shoppes, Squilla: in French, Stiboule, Squille, Oignon de
mer: in high douch Meerzwibel: in base Almaigne, Zee Ayeuyn: of Serapio, Cepe
muris, that is to say, Mowce Onyon: in English, Squilla, and Sea Onyon.

Pancratiu^, which is of nature like to Squilla, and therefore without any
error it may be used in steed of Squilla. And this kind of the learned Peter
Belon is counted to be Bulbus littoralis of Theophrastus, whereunto it is very
much like: for Dioscorides Pancratium, and Theophrastus Bulbus littoralis do
seem to be all one.

The Nature.
Squilla is hoate in the second degree, and dry in the third degree, and of
very subtle parts, also of a cutting and scouring nature.

Scilla c\o^munis Pancrati\u^ Squilla.


The Virtues.














heels, and hanginge wartes, especially when it is first roasted under the
imbers.











The Danger.
Squilla is a very sharp medicine, both subtle and wasting, hurtful and
forsing the nature of man, when it is taken or used raw: and therefore Galen
says, it ought not to be used or taken into the body without it be first
sodde^ or roasted.

Of Affodyll. Chap. lxxix.
The Kinds.
THere be three kinds of Affodill, that is to say, the male, and female, and a
third sort with yellowe flowers.

Asphodelus mas. The male Affodyll.


Asphodelus foemina. The female Affodyl.


The Description.


Asphodelitertia species. Yellow Affodyll.


Bulbus, but somewhat bigger. To conclude, this Affodyll is not much unlike
the first kind but only in the root, wherein is all the difference betwixt
these two herbs: for they vary not much one from another in leaves, stalks,
flowers, and seeds, saving that the leaves of this kind are shorter, the
flowers stand further a sunder, and not so thick set, or throng together.



The Place.
Affodyl is not found growing of his own kind in this Country, but in the
gardens of Herboristes, where as they do both sow and playnt it.

The Time.




The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Albucus, and Hastula regia: in
shops Affodilus: in French, Hache royale, or Asphodel: of the common
Herboristes of Brabant, Affodilen. The flower with his stem is called in
Greek (...), Anthericos: and in Latin, as Pliny says, Albucum: in English
also Affodyl, and Daffodyll.

Asphodelus mas, and Hastula regia mas, and is that same which Dioscorides
describes.

Asphodelus foemina, and Hastula regia foemina, and is that which Galen
describes, in lib. de alimentorum facultatibus.

The Virtues.






















Of the Vine. Chap. lxxx.
The Kinds.
THere are diverse sorts of vines, but above all the rest there are two most
notable: that is to say, the garden or husbanded vine, and the wild vine, as
writes Dioscorides, and the Ancientes. The manured or husbanded vine is also
of diverse sorts, both in fashion and color, so that it is not easy to number
or describe all the kinds: whereof it shall be sufficient for us to divide the
garden or husbanded vine into three kinds: whereof the first is very red, and
yields a dark red liquer, the which is called of some Tinctura. The second
is blewe, and yields a clear white liquer, the which yet notwithstanding
wareth read, when it is suffered to setle in the vessel. The third vine is
white and yields a white wine or liquer, the which continues white. And all
these sorts of the manured or garden vines are like one another in leaves,
branches, wood, and timber.

The Description.
THE vine has many weak and slender branches, of a woody substance,
ouercouered with a cloue^ bark, or chinking rind (from which branches)
grows forth new increase of knottie shutes or springes, bringing forth at
every knotte or joint, broad iagged leaves, divided into five cuttes or
parts, also it puts forth at the aforesaid joints with the leaves
certain tendrelles, or clasping caprioles, and tying tagglets, wherewith al it
takes hold upon trees, poles, and perches, and all things else that it may
attain unto. The same new springes and branches, do also bring forth, for
the most part, at the second, third, and fourth knotte or joint, first of all
little bushie tuftes, with white blossoms or flowers, and after them pleasant
clusters of many berries or grapes, thick set and trussed together, with in
which berries or grapes are found small graynes or kernelles, which be the
seed of the vine.

Vitis. The manured vine.


The Place.
The vine delights to grow upon mountains, that stand open to the South,
in hoate Countries and Regions, as in Canarie, and the Islands adjoining in
Barbaria, Spain, Greece, Candie, Sicile, Italy, and diverse other hoate
Regions. It grows also in France, and Almaigne, by the river Rheyne, and in
some places of Netherland, as Brabant, Haynau, and Liege: but that which
grows in these lower Countries do bring forth very small or thin wines, for
none other cause but only because ye Son is not so vehement, and the nights
be shorter. For (as Constantine Caesar writes.) The Son must give to the
wine strength and virtue, and the night his sweetness, and the Moon shine
his rypenesse. And therefore are the vines of Cananarie, of Candie, and other
the like hoate Countries, both sweet and strong: for the Son shines
vehemently in those Countries, and the nights be longer then in this Country.
And for this consyderation the wine of Rheyne, and of other the Septentrional
or North Regions are weaker, and not so sweet and pleasant, because ye nights
in those Countries be shorter, and the Son has not so much strength. And
for the same cause also it grows not in Norweigh, Swedlande, Denmark,
Westphale, Prusse, and other cold Countries: for the nights be there in
summer short, and the power of the Son is but small.

The Time.
The vine flowreth in high and base Germany or Almaigne, about the beginning
of June, and the grapes be through ripe in September. A month after, that is
to say in Octoker, they press forth the wine, and put it into hoggesheades,
and vessels, fit for that purpose, and therefore they call the month of
October in Douche, Wijnmaent.

The Names.
The manured vine is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Vitis vinifera: in high
Douche, Weinreb: in base Almaigne, Wijngaert: in English, the garden or
manured Vine or Grape.

The Nature.
The leaves, branches, and tendrelles of the vine, are cold, dry, and
astringent, and so be the green berries or unripe grapes: but the ripe grapes
are hoate and moist in the first degree, and the Raysen or dried grape is hoate
and dry, as witnesses Galen.

The Virtues.




















Of the wild Vine or Grape. Chap. lxxxi.
The Kinds.
THe wild vine is of two sorts, as Dioscorides says, the one sort has
flowers, and grapes which never come to ripeness: and the other brings
forth small grapes or berries which come to ripeness.

The Description.




The Names.
The wild vine is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Vitis syluestris, and
Labrusca: in English, the wild grape or vine.

Oenanthe.

The juice which they press out of the grapes of this vine, and of all other
sorts of green and unripe grapes, as well of the garden as of the wild kind of
vines, is called in Greek (...): and in Latin, Omphacium: in shops, Agresta:
in French, Verius, and of some Aigras: in base Almaigne, Veryus: in English,
Verius.

Passulae de Corintho: in French, Raisins de Corinthe: in base Almaigne,
Coruithen: in English, Currantes, and small Raysens of Corynthe,

The Nature.
The leaves, branches, and clasping capreoles of the wild vine, have like
power and virtue, as the leaves, branches, and clasping tendrelles of the
manured or garden vine, and so has the Verius of the same. The Raysens or
Currantes are hoate and moist of nature and complexion, not much unlike the
common frail Raysens in operation.

Of the Rose. Chap. i.
The Kinds.
THere be diverse kinds of Roses, whereof some are of the garden, sweet
smelling, and are set, planted, and favored, the others are wild, growing of
their own kind without setting about hedges, and the borders of feeldes.

The Description.


Rosa. The Rose.


and springes be like them of the red Rose, saving that they grow up higher,
and yet for all that they grow not so high as the white Rose, so that this Rose
should seem to be a middle sort or mean kind betwixt the red and the white
Roses, which thing the very color of the flowers declare to be true, for they
be neither read nor white, but of a mixed color betwixt red and white, almost
carnation color, in all things else like to the others.















The Place.
The tame Roses, and the Eglentine are planted in gardens. The wild grows in
many places of Brabant and other Countries, along by hedges and ditches, and
other wild places amongst briars and thorns. The other wild kind grows in
certain places upon rampers and banks cast up by man's hands, and upon the
Sea coast of Flaunders.

The Time.
The five first kinds of garden Roses do flower in May and June, and so do the
wild Roses and the Eglentine: but the Musk Roses do flower in May, and again
in September, or there aboutes.

The Names.
The Rose is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Rosa: in high Douche, Rose: in
Neatherdouchelande, Roose: The leaves and flowers be called in Latin, Folia
Rosarum, that is to say, Rose leaves.

The nails, that is to say, the white ends of the leaves whereby they are
fastened to the knappes (the which are cut of when they make Conserve or
syrup of Roses) is called in Latin, Vngues Rosarum, and in Greek, (...).

The yellow hear which grows in the middle of the Rose, is called in Greek
(...): in Latin, Flos Rosae: in shops and of the Arabian Physicians Anthera,
that is to say, the blowing of the Rose.

The bud of the Rose before the opening is called Calix.

The five little leaves which stand round about the bud, or the beginning of
Roses, are called in Latin, Cortices Rosarum, that is to say, the shelles or
pills of Roses: some do also call them, the five brothers of the Roses, whereof,
as is beforesayd, two have beardes, and two have none, and the fifth has but
half a one.

The round heads or little knoppes, upon which the flowers do grow, and are
fastened, and in which lies the seed, are called in Latin, Capita Rosarum:
and in Greek (...).

Rosa Damascena, in this Country, Rosa alba: in French, Rose blanch: in high
Douche, Weisz Rosen: in base Almaigne, Wit Roosen: in English, White Roses.
And this kind seems to be that, which Pliny calls in Latin; Campana Rosa.

Rosa purpurea, and Rosa rubra: in English Red Roses, and of the common
people, Double Roses: in French, Rose rouge and Roses francois: in high
Douche, Roter Rosen: in base Almaigne, Roode Roosen. And under this kind are
comprehended the Roses which Pliny calls Trachinias, amongst which Rosae
Milesiae are the deepest red.

Rosee de Provinces: in base Almaigne, Prouinsche Roosen: in high Douch,
Liebfarbige Rosen: the which paraduenture are they which Pliny calls
Alabandicas Rosas: we call them in English, Roses of Province, and Damask Roses.

Rose de Prouins: in base Almaigne, Prouinsch Roose, and Bruyn Prouinsche
Roose: as a name of difference from the other, and these should seem to be
Rosae Milesiae of Pliny.

Rosa Praenestina of Pliny: some call it in English, the Cyuet Rose, or
Bastard Musk Rose.

Rosa coroncola, of the writers at this day Rosa sera, and Rosa autumnalis: in
French, Rose Musquee, and Roses de Damas: in base Almaigne, Musket Rooskens:
in English also, Musk Roses, because of their pleasant sent.

Rosa canina, and Rosa syluestris: in French, Rose sauuage: in high Douche,
Wilder Roosen, and Heckrosen: in base Almaigne, Wild Rosen: in English, the
Bryer bushe, the wild Rose, and Heptree. The spongious bawle or that round
rough excrescence which is found oftentimes growing both upon the wild Rose
and Eglentine bushes, is called of some Apothecaries Bedegar: but wrongfully,
for Bedegar, is not that thistell which is commonly called Carlina. Examine
Bedegar, lib. 4. fol. 361.

Canirubus, and Rubus canis, and of Pliny, Rosa spinosa.

Roses iaulnes.

Lychnis: in Latin, Rosa Grca: in French, and base Almaigne, Eglantier: in
English, Eglantine.

The cause of the Name and history thereof.
The Rose is called in Greek Rhodon, because it is of an excellent smell and
pleasant savor, as Plutarche writes.

Ye shall also find this written of Roses, that at the first they were all
white, and that they became red afterward with the blood of the Goddess
Venus, which was done in this sort.

Venus loved the younker Adonis better then the warrier Mars, (who loved Venus
with all his force and might) but when Mars perceived that Venus loved Adonis
better then him, he slew Adonis, thinking by this means, to cause Venus not
only to forgo, but also to forget her friend Adonis, and so to love Mars
only: of the which thing when Venus had warning how and where it should be
accomplished, she was suddenly moved and ran hastily to have rescued Adonis,
but taking no care of the way at a sudden ere she was ware, she threw her
self upon a bed or thicket of white Roses, where as with sharp and cruel
thorns, her tender feet were so pricked and wounded, that the blood sprange
out abundantly, wherwithal when the Roses were bedewed, and sprincled, they
became al red, the which color they do yet keep (more or less) according to
the quantity of blood that fell upon them) in remembrance of the clear and
pleasant Venus. Some others write that for very anger which she had conceived
against Mars, for the killing of her friend the fair Adonis, she gave her
tender body willingly to be spoiled and mangled: and in despite of Mars, she
threw her self into a bed or herbour of prickley Roses.

Some also say that Roses became red, with the casting down of that heavenly
drink Nectar, which was shed by Cupide that wanton boy, who playing with the
Gods sitting at the table at a Banquet, with his wings overthrew the pot
wherein the Nectar was. And therefore as Philostratus says, the Rose is the
flower of Cupide, or Cupides flower.

The Nature.
Rose leaves, that is to say of the flowers, be hoate of complexio^, and
somewhat moist, taking part of a binding quality. The flower that is to say,
the little yellowe hears that grow in the middle of the Rose, is manifestly
dry and astringent: of the same nature are the buddes, knoppes, and fruit,
with the rough round hearie bawle or excrescence that is found growing upon
the wild Rose.

The Virtues.


heart, for it drives forth, and dispatcheth all corrupt and evil humors, in
and about the veins of the heart.















Of Iasmine. Chap. ij.
The Description.
IAsmine grows in manner of a hedge or quickeset, and must be led along and
carried as the Rose or vine, it brings forth many small branches full of
joints or knottes, the shutes and twigges whereof are filled full of a spongie
pith, like the pith of Elder. The leaves be of a dark green color, parted
into five or seven other little leaves, (growing upon a stem or foot stalk,
like to the Ash leaf) whereof each little leaf by it self is smothe and
somewhat long, nothing at all natched, or toothed about the edges. The flowers
be white and long of a sweet and pleasant savor, and do grow four or five
together at the top of the branches.

The Place.
Iasmyne grows in some Countries of his own kind, as in Spain and some
places of England, in this Country it is planted in gardens.

Iasminum.


The Time.
Iasmyne flowreth in July and August, but the fruit in this Country comes
not to perfection.

The Names.
This plant is called of the Arabians Zambach and Iesemin, and accordingly it
is called amongst the Herboristes of England, France, and Germany Iasminum,
and Ieseminum, and of some also Iosme, and Iosmenum. The later writers do call
it also in Latin, Apiaria: because that Bees delight greatly to be about the
flowers thereof: some call it also Leucanthemum.

The Nature.
Serapio writes, that Iasmin is hoate almost in the second degree, which a
man may also very well perceive by his bitter taste.

The Virtues.






Of Cistus. Chap. iij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Cistus of Dioscorides, and the Auncientes.

The one is a kind of plant whereof we do here give you the figure.

The other plant is of woody substance, upon which is found that humor or
fat liquor, which they call Ladanum.

Ladanum, is also of two sorts, that is to say, the male and female.



The Description.
Ladanum, has round rough or hearishe stalks, and stemmes with knobbed
joints, and full of branches. The leaves be coundishe and covered with a
cotton or soft hear, not much unlike the leaves of Sage, but shorter and
rounder. The flowers grow at the top of the stalks, of the fashion of a single
Rose, whereof the male kind is of color red, and the femall white, at the
last they change into knoppes or husks in which the seed is contained.

Whereas Cistus grows naturally of his own kind, there is found a certain
excrescence or outgrowing about ye root of this plant, which is of color
sometimes yellow, sometimes white, and sometimes green: out of the which is a
certain juice taken out by art, yt which they use in shops, and is called
Hypocistis.



Upon this plant is found a certain fatness, whereof they make Ladanum the
which about midsomer, and in the hoatest days, is found growing upon the new
leaves of this Cistus, the which new leaves (after that the seed with the
old leaves are fallen of) do first bud forth and spring in summer. The said
fat or grease is not only taken from the beardes and feet of Goats, or Goat
buckes which feed upon the leaves and branches of this plant (as Cistus non
ladanifera.
Cistus cum Hypocistide.
Dioscorides and the Auncientes do write) but also it is gathered and taken
with things fit for that purpose, devised by the industry and diligence of
man, as some of the learned writers of our time do report, especially ye
learned Peter Belon the which has much haunted and trauayled the Island of
Crete or Candie.

The Place.
The first kind of Cistus, whose figure we set forth here for your better
understanding, grows in sundry places of Italy, Sicile, Candie, Ciprus,
Languedoc, and many other hoate Countries, in rough, stony and vntoyled places.

The second kind is often found in Crete, Ciprus, and also in Languedoc.

The Time.


Ladanum.

The Names.
Cistus, and Cistus non Ladanifera: of Scribonius Largus, Rosa syluatica.

That which grows about the root of Cistus, is called in Greek (...): of
some Erythanon and Cytinus, out of this they draw forth a sap or liquor the
which they call Hypocistis, and in shoppes Hypoquistidos.

Cistus is called in Greek (...): in Latin Ledum, Ladum, and of the later
writers, Cistus Ladanifera.

The fat dew or liquor, which is gathered from the leaves, is called in
Greek (...): in Latin Ladanum: and in Shoppes Lapadanum.

The Nature.




Ladanum is full hoate in the first degree, and reaches near unto the second,
and is somewhat dry and astringent.

The Virtues.




Hypocistis stops all laskes and fluxes of the belly, and is of a stronger
operation then the flowers or leaves of Cistus: wherefore it cures the bloody
flixe and all other fluxes, especially the superfluous flowing of women's
flowers.

Ladanum dronken with old wine, stops the laske, and provoke urine.





Ladanum dropped into the ears with honyed water or oil of Roses, heals the
pain of the same.





Of the Gramble or Glackebery bushe. Chap. iiij.
The Kinds.
The Bramble is of two sorts, as Ruelius writes, the great and the small.

The Description.


The branches or shutes of this Bramble be also set with prickley thorns, but
the thorns or prickles be not so sharp: the fruit is also like to a small
Mulberie, but lesser then the fruit of the other. The roots of both kinds do
put forth many slender shutes and branches, the which do creep and trayle
along the ground.

The Place.
Brambles do grow much in the feelds and pastures of this Country, and in the
wooddes and Copses, and such other covert places.

The Time.
The Bramble bush flowreth from May to July, and the fruit is ripe in August.

The Names.
Rubus, and Sentis: in high Douche, Bremen: in base Almaigne, Breeme^ and
Braemen: in English, the Bramble or black berie bushe: in French, Rouc^.

Morum rubi, and Vacinia: in shops, Mora bati, and of some ignorant people,
Mora bassi: in French, Meure de Rouce, or Meurons: in high Douch, Brombeer: in
base Almaigne, Brae^besien, and Haghebesien: in English, Bramble beries, and
black beries.

Rubus. The Bramble.


Chambatus, that is to say in Latin, Humirubus: and the fruit is called in
French, Catherine: in English, a hear Bremble, or heath Bramble, a Cocolas
panter, and of some a bryer. The fruit is called a Dewberie, or blackberie.

The Nature.
The tender springes and new leaves of the Bramble, are cold and dry almost
in the third degree, and astringent or binding, and so is the unripe fruit.

The ripe fruit is somewhat warm and astringent, but not so much as the
unripe fruit.

The Virtues.
















Of Framboys / Raspis / or Hyndberie. Chap. v.
The Description.


The Place.
The Framboye is found in some places of Douchland in dark woods: and in this
Country they plant it in gardens, and it loves shadowye places, where as the
Son shineht not often.

The Time.
The Framboye flowreth in May and June, the fruit is ripe in July.

Rubus Idaeus.


The Names.
This Bramble is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Rubus Idaeus, of the
mountain Ida, in Asia minor, or the lesser Asia, not far from Troy, where
as grows abundance of this Bramble, and there it was first found: it is
called in French, Framboisier: in Douch, Hinnebraemen: in English, Framboys,
Raspis, and Hindberrie. Ioh. Agricola calls it in Latin, Crispina.

The fruit of this Bramble is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Morum rubi
Idaei: in French, Framboises: in high Douch, Hymbeeren, and Horbeeren: in base
Almaigne, Hinnebesien, and Frambesien: in English, Raspis, and Framboys berries.

The Nature.
The Framboye of complexion is somewhat like the black berrie, but it is not
of so astringent nor drying quality.

The Virtues.
unlike in virtue and working, to the leaves, shutes, fruit, and roots of the
other Bramble, as Dioscorides writes.





Of Browme. Chap. vi.
The Kinds.
THE common Broom is of two sorts, the one high and tawle, the other low and
small, under which grows Broom Rape or Orabanche.

Genista. Broom.


Rapum genistae. Broom Rape, or Orobanche.


The Description.








The Place.






The Time.




The Names.
Genesta, Genista, and Genestra: in English, Broom: in French, Genest, and
Dugenet, or Geneste in high Douche, Ginst, and Pfrimmen: in base Almaigne,
Brem, and without doubt it is a kind of Spartium.

Rapum Genistae, and Rapa Genestrae, that is to say, Broom Rape, and is
without doubt a kind of Orobanche, and Limodorum.

Orobanche, (...), Limodoru^, of some other as of Photion also, (...), that is,
Leguminu^ Leo. It has no French nor Douche name that I know: Turner lib. 2.
fol. 72. calls it Orobanche, Choke fitche, Stra^gle tare, Strangleweede,
Orobstrangler, and Choke weed.

The Nature.
Broom is full hoate in the second degree, and reaches almost to the third
degree, it is scouring and of subtle parts.

The Virtues.
good for them that have the dropsy, and for all them that have any stopping
of the liver, the spleen or melt, the kidneyes or bladder: for partly it
purges and drives out of the belly, and partly it purges by urine, all
waterie, tough, and superfluous humors. The seed is of the same virtue to be
taken the quaniitie of a dram, or a dram and a half.

















Of Spanish Groom. Chap. vij.
The Description.




The Place.
This Broom grows in dry places of Spain, and Languedoc, and is not found
in this Country, but in the gardens of Herboristes.

high nor so straight, but lies along almost upon the ground, with many small
branches, proceeding from a woody stem, and set with little long small leaves,
and at ye top with many fair yellow flowers not much unlike the flowers of the
common Broom, but smaller: after them come narrow husks or coddes, wherein is

This kind of Broom grows in vntoyled places that stand low, and sometimes
also in moist Clay grounds. It is found about Anwarpe.

The Time.
It flowreth in July and August, and sometimes after, and shortly after the
seed is ripe.

Genista humilis.


The Names.
This plant is doubtless a kind of Broom, and therefore it may be well
called in Latin, Genista humilis: in Italian Cerretta: that is, low and base
Broom: in base Almaigne, Ackerbrem: the high Germaynes do make of it Flos
tinctorius, that is to say, ye flower to stain, or dye withal, and do term it
in their language, Ferbblumen, Geel Ferbblumen, and Heyden smucke, because the
Dyers do use of it to die their clothes yellow: in English, Woodwaxen, and base

a kind of thornie Broom, the which is rough and very full of prickles, and
brings forth straight springes or shutes, of a wooddish substance, and
without leaves, set thick and full of long sharp pinnes or prickles, very
rough, boysteous, hard and pricking, amongst which grow small yellowe
flowers, and afterward coddes, like to the Broom flowers or coddes. The
roots be long growing ouerthwartly in the ground, and almost as plyant and
limmer as the root of Rest harrow or Cammocke.

Genistilla. Thorn Broom.


Genista spinosa. Furze.


The Place.




The Time.
Thorn Broom flowreth in May and June.

At the same time flowreth the common Furze.

The Names.
Genistella, and Genestalla, that is to say, the small Broom: in high Douche,
Erdtfrymmen, of some, Klein Streichblumen, and Stechende Pfrymmen: in base
Almaigne, Stekende Brem: in English, Thornebroome.

therefore seem to be a prickley and wild kind of Broom, wherefore it may be
called in Latin, Genista spinosa, and Genista fyluestris: they call it in
French, Du ionc marin in base Almaigne, Gaspeldoren: in English, the common
Whyn, or great Furze. This is not Tragacantha, that is to say, Hirci spina, or
Paliurus, as some do think: nor yet Nepa or Scorpius.

The Nature.
Furze (but especially the leaves) are of nature dry and astringent.

The Virtues.




Of Cammocke / Rest Harrow / or Pety Whyn. Chap. x.
The Description.
CAmmocke or ground Furze has many small, lythey, or weak branches, set full
of swarte green and roundish leaves, and sharp, stiff prickley thorns:
amongst which are sweet smelling flowers like Pease flowers or blowinges,
most commonly of a purple or carnatio^ color, sometimes all white, and
sometimes yellowe like Broom flowers, but that it is very seldom seen or
found: after the flowers come small coddes or husks, full of broad flat seed.
The root is long and very limmer, spreading his branches both large and long
under the earth, and does oftentimes let, hinder, and stay, both the plough
and Oxen in toyling the ground, for they be so tough and limmer, that the share
and colter of the plough cannot easily divide, and cut them asunder.

The Place.
Cammocke or ground Furze is found in some places of Brabant and England, about
the borders of fertile feeldes, and good pastures.

The Time.
It flowreth most commonly in June.

Of Whortes and Whortelberies. Chap. xi.
The Kinds.
There be two sorts of Whortes, and Whortel beries, whereof the common sort are
black, and the other are red.

ripe, howbeit they are but seldom seen.





Vacinia palustria. Marrish Whortes.


The Place.




The Time.
Whortes do blow in May, and their berries be ripe in June. Fen or Marrishe
Whortes are ripe in July and August.

The Names.
des Cusins, or des Morets. in high Douche, Heydelbeeren, Drumperbeeren, and
Bruchbeeren, in Braba^t, Crakebesien, Postelbesien, and Hauerbesien. It may
very well be called in Latin Vacinia, because they be little berries, in
Latin, Baccae: for as some learned men write, the word Vacinium, comes of
Baccinium, and was derived of Bacca: and without doubt this name agrees better
with them, then the name of Myrtilli, the which some do call them by: yet
these berries be not the right Vacinia, whereof Virgil writes saying, Alba
ligustra cadunt, Vacinia nigra leguntur. Their true English name is Whortes,
and of some Whortel beries.

Vacinia palustria, that is to say, Marrish Whorts, and Fenberies: for there is
none other name known unto us, except it be Samolus of Pliny, or Oxoycocron
of Valerius Cordus.

The Nature.
Whortes, but especially those that be black, do cool in the second degree,
and somewhat they dry and are astringent. Of the like temperament are Marrish
whortes.

tuftes, full of many small flowers, and after them store of square or cornered
seeds clustering together. This seed is of a strong savor and bitter taste,
and full of fat and Oily sap. The root is hard as the root of Whortes or
Whortell plants.



The Place.




The Time.




The Names.
Myrtus, and the seed thereof Myrtilli: notwithstanding, it is not Myrtus.
Wherefore it is called of some of the later writers, Pseudomyrsine, and Myrtus
Brabantica, and in some places of Almaigne they call it Altsein, and Borst, some
take it to be (...), Oleagnus, of Theophrastus, whereunto it is not very much
like, but it seems to be that kind of wild Rhus, which Pliny speaks of
in the xxiiij. Chapter of the xj. book of his excellent work, called the
History of Nature.

Gratia Dei, howbeit it is nothing like, Gratia Dei, or Gratiola, which is a
kind of the less Centaurie, set forth in the third part of this History

fruit in August, but in this Country it bears no fruit.

The Names.
This herb is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Ruscum, Ruscus, and Myrtus
syluestris, and Scopa Regia, as Marcellus an Ancient writer says. In Shoppes
it is called Ruscus: in English, Kneeholme, Kneehul, Butchers broom, and
Petigree. also we may call it ye wild Myrtel: it is called in French Myrte
sauuage, of some Buys poignant, and Housson: in high Douche, Meuszdorn, and
Keerbesien: in base Almaigne, Stekende palm, that is to say, Prickley Box,
because it is somewhat like Box, the which they do commonly call Palmboom:

Heath.

The Description.
HEath is a wooddish plant full of branches, not much unlike the lesser
Tamarisk, but much smaller, tenderer, and lower, it has very small iagged
leaves, not much unlike the leaves of garden Cypres (which is our Lauender
Cotton) but browner and harder. The flowers be like small knoppes or buttons
parted in four, of a fair carnation color, and sometimes (but very seldom)
white, growing along the branches from the middle upward even to the top.
The roots be long and wooddishe, and of a dark red color.

The second kind of Heath, is also a little base plant, with many little twigges,
or small slender shutes coming from the root, of a reddishe brown color,
Erica. Heath.
Erica altera. Small Heath.
with very small leaves, in fashion not unlike the leaves of common Thyme, but
much smaller and tenderer, the flowers grow at the top of the strigges, or
twigges, five or six in a company together, hanging downewardes, of color
Carnation and red, of making long and round, hollow within, and open at the
end like a little tonnell, smaller then a Cornell which is the fruit of a
Cornell tree. The root is tender, and creeping along, and puts forth in
diverse places many new twigges or strigges.

The Virtues.




The learned Matthiolus in his Commentaries upon Dioscorides lib. j. doubts
not of this plant but that it is Erica of Dioscorides, whereunto he has set
two other figures of strange Heath, sent unto him by one Gabriel Falloppius a
learned Physician. Moreover he commends much the decoction of our common
Heath made with fair water, to be dronke^ warm both morning and evening, in
the quantity of five ounces, three hours before meat, against the stone in ye
bladder, so that it be used by the space of thirty days: but at the last the
patient must enter into a bath made of the decoction of Heath, and whiles he is
in the said bath, he must sit upon some of the Heath that made the foresaid
bath, the which bath must be oftentimes repeted and used. for by the use of the
said bath and diet or decoction he has known many to be helped, so that the
stone has come from them in very small pieces. Also Turner says, that for the
diseases of the milte, it were better to use the barks of Heath (in steed of
Tamarisk) then the bark of Quickbeme. Tur. li. 1. fol. 210. li. 2. fol 59.

Of Cotton or Bombace. Chap. xvij.
The Description.
THis plant is but a shrub or low tree that grows not very high: the leaves
be broad with deep cuttes or slittes, smaller then vine leaves, but else
somewhat like. The flowers be yellowe, and somewhat purple in the mids, iagged
about the edges. The fruit is almost like to Fylbeardes, broad and flat, and
full of fair white cotton, or the down that we call Bombace, in which the
seed lies hydden.

THE Caper is a prickley plant or bush almost like the Bramble, with many
shutes or branches spread abroad and stretched along the ground, upon
which do grow hard sharp and crooked prickles with blackishe round leaves,
standing one against another, not much unlike the leaves of Asarabacca, or
folefoote, or the leaves of a Quince tree, as Dioscorides says, but much
rounder. Amongst the leaves spring up small knops or buds, the which do open
into fair starrelyke flowers, of a pleasant smell or savor: afterward
comes the fruit which is long and round, smaller then an Olyue, and has in
it small corns or kernelles (like to them in the Pomgranate, as Turner says.)
The root is long and wooddishe, covered with a white thick bark or rind,
whereof they use in Physic.

Capparis.


The Place.
Capers grow in rough vntoyled places, in stony sandy ground, and in hedges:
and it grows plentifully in Spain, Italy, Arabia, and other such hoate
Countries: it grows not in this Country, but the fruit and flowers are
known unto us, because they be brought to us from Spain preserved in bryne or
salt.

The Names.
Capers are called in Greek (...): and in Latin, Capparis, of some also
(...), Cynosbatos, that is to say in Latin, Rubus Canis, and Sentis Canis: in

The Nature.
The Capers that grow in Africa, Arabia, Lybia, and other hoate Countries, are
very hoate even almost in the third degree, causing wheales, pustulles, and
ulcers in the mouth, consuming and eating the flesh even to the bones, but they
which grow in Italy and Spain, be not so strong (and, as Simeon Sethy
writes, they be hoate and dry in the second degree) and therefore are fitter
to be eaten, because they be moderately hoate, dry, and astringent, especial
the bark of the root which is most desired in Physic: for the flowers and
young leaves be not of so strong operation, and therefore do serve better to
be eaten with meats.

The Virtues.
















Of Gooseberies. Chap. xix.

hedges. It is also much planted in gardens, especially in the gardens of
Herboristes.

The Time.
The Barberie bushe puts forth new leaves in April, as the most part of
other trees does: it flowreth in May, and the fruit is ripe in September.

The Names.
This plant is called in shops Berberis, especially the fruit thereof, ye which

Crespinus: in English, Barberies, and the Barberie bushe or tree: in French,
Espine vinette: in high Douche, Paisselbeer, Saurich, Erbsel, Versich: in base
Almaigne Sauseboom. This is a kind of Amyrberis, that is to say, Oxyacantha,
in Auicen and Serapio^, the which do set out two kinds of Amyrberis: The one
having a red fruit, the which Dioscorides calls Oxyacantha, and is
described hereafter in the xxxi. Chap. the other with a long blackishe fruit,
and is counted for the best Amyrberis, and is that which the later writers do

set full of prickles.



Acatia Aegyptia. Acatia of Egypt.


Acatia altera. Acatia of Pontus.


The Place.




The Names.
Acatia, of Theophrastus (...), in Latin, Spina. The gum coming out of this
tree is called in Shoppes Gummi Arabicum, and is well known, howbeit the liquor
or juice of Acatia, which is also called Acatia, is unknown: for in steed of
Acatia, they use in shoppes the juice of Sloos, or Snagges, which is the
fruit of black thorns (called in base Almaigne, Sleen) and wrongly Acatia.

Acatia, is taken of some learned men for (...), Aspalathus, and not for
Acatia. Matthiolus sets it forth for the second kind of Acatia, called
Acatia Pontica, and Acatia altera.

The Nature.
Acatia, especially the juice therefore (which the Ancientes used) is dry in the
third degree, and cold in the first, as Galen says.

THere is now two sorts of Myrtell, the one called the great or common
Myrtell, the other the fine or noble Myrtel.

The Description.




Periuinca, in all things else like to the others.

Myrtus. Myrtel tree.


The Place.
The Myrtell tree or bush, grows plentifully in Spain and Italy about
Naples. It grows not in this Counitre, but in the gardens of certain
Herboristes, the which do set it in paniers or baskettes, and with great heed
and diligence they preserve it from the cold of winter: for it cannot endure
the cold of this Country. The small Myrtell is more common in this Country,
than the greater.

The Time.
The Myrtell tree flowreth but seldom in this Country, except sometimes in a
very hoate summer: then it flowreth in June, without bearing either fruit or
seed.

The Names.
The Myrtell is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Myrtus: by the which name
it is known in the shopppes of this Country.

The fruit of the Myrtel is called in shops Myrtilli.

The cause of the Name
The Myrtel is called in Greek (...), because of a young Maiden of Athenes
named Myrsine: who in beauty excelled all the Maidens of that City, and in
strength and actiuitie all the lusty laddes, or brave young men of Athenes,
wherefore she was tenderly beloved of the Goddess Pallas or Mincrua. Who
willed her to be always present at tourney, and tilte, running, vauting, and
other such plays of actiuitie or exercise: to the intent she should afterward
as a judge give the garlande or Crown of honor to such as wan the price, and
best deserved the same: but some of them who were vanquished, were so much
displeased with her judgment, that they slew her. The which thing as soon as
the Goddess Minerue perceived, she caused the sweet Myrtell to spring up, and
called it Myrsine, after the name of the Damsel Myrsine, to the honor and
perpetual memory of her, which tree or plant she loves as much as ever she
loved the young Damosel Myrsine.

The Nature.
Myrtell is dry in the third degree, and cold in the first.

The Kinds.
There are two sorts of Bay trees, the one with green boughs and branches,
and hard thick leaves, the other has reddishe branches, especially when it
is young, and softer leaves, and more gentle then the first.

The Description




Laurus. Laurel or Bay tree.


The Place.
Bay grows plentifully in Spain and the like hoate Countries. in this low
Country they plant it in gardens and defend it in the winter time from cold
with great diligence, saving Zealande, and by the Sea side in saltishe
grounds: for there it grows well of his own accord, and dies not in the
winter season, as it does in sweet grounds.

The Time.
The Bay tree loses not his leaves, but abides green both winter and
summer. And about March or April it puts forth new leaves and springes,
it brings forth no fruit in the lower Germany, but in England it bears
plenty.

The Names.
Laurus: in high Douche, Lorbeerbaum: in base Almaigne, Laurus boom: in
English, Bay or Laurel tree.

Lauri bacc: in English, Bay beries: in French, Bays, or Grains de Laurier:
in high Douche, Lorbeeren: in base Almaigne, Bakeleers.

The cause of the Name.
The Bay tree is called in Greek (...), by the name of a young Nymphe, called
Daphne the daughter of Ladon, and the earth, whom the God Apollo loved, and was
much enamoured of her, so that he followed her every where so long, that at the
last he took hold of her and held her fast. But she not otherwise able to
avoid the importunate sewte of Apollo, sodaynely called for succor of her
mother the earth, who presently opened, and swallowed in her daughter Daphne,
and in steed of her brought forth a fair Bay tree. When Apollo saw this
change, he was much astonished, and named the tree Daphne, after the name of his
beloved Daphne, and took a branch thereof, and twisted a garlande or cap, and
set it on his head. Whereby from that time hitherto, the Bay has still
continued as a token of prophecy, and is dedicated to Apollo, that is to say,
the Son. Therefore the Heathen say, that the Bay tree withstandeth all evil
sprites and enchantmentes: so that in the house where as is but one branch of
Bay, they affirm that neither enchantements, lightninges, nor the falling
evil may hurt any body that is within. They say also, that the Bay or Laurel
brings health. And for these causes (in times past) there was given a branche
of Bay to the Romayne Senators every New years day. And for these causes also
the Poets were crowned with Garlandes of Bay, because that Poetry, or the
works of Poets, is a kind of prophecy or foothsaying, the which Apollo
governs and rules.

The Nature.
The leaves and fruit of the Bay tree, are hoate and dry in the second
degree, especially the fruit, the which is hoater then the leaves. The bark
of the root is hoate and dry in the third degree.

grows along the high ways and paths: in Latin of Matthiolus, Spina
infectoria, and of some others, Rhamnus solutiuus, the which name I do
subscribe unto, because I know none other Latin name, albeit it is nothing
like to Rhamnus of Dioscorides, or of Theophrastus, and therefore not the right
Rhamnus. The Italians do call it Spino Merlo, some call it Spino ceruino, Spin
guerzo, and of Valerius Cordus, Cerui spina: we may well call it in English,
Bucke Thorn.

The fruit of the same thorn is called in Brabant, Rhijnbesien, that is to

Of Holme / Holly / or Huluer. Chap. xxxiiij.
The Description.
HOlme grows sometimes after the manner af a hedge plant, amongst other
thorns and bushes, and sometimes also it grows upright and straight, and
becomes a tall high and great tree, with a big stem or body, and limbs and
branches according to the same. The timber of this tree is hard and heavy,
and sinketh to the bottom of the water like Guaiacum, or Lignum sanctum,
whereunto our Holly in figure is not much unlike. The leaves of Holly are
thick and hard, of the quantity of a Bay leaf, but full of sharp points
or prickley corners. The which leaves remain green both winter and summer,
as the leaves of Box and Bay, and do not lightly vade or wither. The beries
or fruit of Holme is round, of the quantity of a Pease, of color red, and
of an evil unpleasant taste.

The Place.
Holme grows much in this Country in rough, stony, barraine and vntoyled
places, along the ways and in wooddes.

syluestris: in high Douch, Walddistel oder Stehpalmen: in base Almaigne, Hulst:
in Italian, Agrifolium, as Matthiolus writes. And in sight it appears to be
much like Plinies Aquifoliu^, which is called of Theophrastus in Greek (...),
and (...), as witnesses Pliny lib. 27. Cap. 7. Neither can it be Paliurus, as
some do esteem it: but it seems to be somewhat like (...). Oxycanthus of
Theophrastus, the which is always green: in English it is called Holme,
Holly, and Husuer.

The Nature.
The beries of Holme or Holly, are hoate.

The Virtues.
Some boasting of their experience upon Holme, do affirm that five beries
thereof taken inwardly, are good against the cholique, and provoke to go to the
stool.

Agrifolium.






Of the Apple tree. Chap. xxxv.
The Kinds.
THere be diverse sorts of Apples, not only differing in figure and proportion
of making, but also in taste, quantity, and color, so that it is not
possible, neither yet necessary, to recite or number all the kinds,
consydering that all Apple trees are almost like one another: and all sorts of
Apples may be comprehended in a few kinds, for the playner declaration of
their natures, faculties, or powers: as into sweet, sower, rough, astringent,
waterish apples, and apples of a mixed temperature, as betwixt sweet and sower,
etc.

The Description.
THE Apple trees in continuance of time, do for the most part become high and
great trees, with many arms and branches spread abroad. The leaves be green
and roundishe, more round then the Peare-tree leaves, and do fall of a little
before winter, and do spring and renew again in May. The flowers for the most
part are white, and upon some apple trees chaungeable, betwixt white and read.
The fruit is round and of many fashions, in color and taste as is abouesayde.
In the middle of the apples are enclosed black kernels covered over with hard
pills or skins.

The Place.
Apple trees are planted in gardens and Orchardes, and they delight in good
fertile ground.

The Time.
Apple trees do most commonly blow, at the end of April and beginning of May.
The fruit is ripe, of some in July, of some in August, and of the last sort in
September.

The Names.
The Apple tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Malus, and Pomus: in high
Douche, Apffelbaum: in base Almaigne, Appelboom: in French, Pommier. The
fruit is called in Greek, (...): in Latin, Pomum, and Malum: in English, an
Apple: in French, Pomme: in high Douch, Apffel: in base Almaigne, Appel.

Malus.


The Nature.
All sorts of Apples be cold and moist, yet some more the^ the rest: those
that be sower or sharp, do dry more then the rest, especially if they be
astringent or binding. Sweet Apples are not so cold, but rather of a mean
temperature. The waterishe apples are moystiest, especially those that are
neither sower nor sweet but taking part of both tastes.

The Virtues.








Of Orenges / Citrons / and Limons. Chap. xxxvi.
The Kinds.
There be at this present, three sorts of Apples or rather fruits, which of
the Auncientes in times past were comprehended under the name of Citrium,
whereof the first is called an Orange, the second a Citron, the third a Limon.

The Description.
THe trees yt bring forth Orenges, Citrons, and Limons, grow as high as other
trees do, with many green branches, in some places set with stiff prickles,
or sharp thorns. The leaves be always green and thick, not much unlike the
Bay leaves. The fruit has a very thick pyl or rind, within the rind is a
clear through shining pulpe or moist substance, full of juice and liquor,
amongst the which is the seed or kernels.







Aurantia Mala. Medica Mala. Limonia Mala. Orange. Citrons. Limons.


The Place.
These fruits do now grow in Italy, Spain, and some places of France. In
this Country the Herboristes do set and plant the Orange trees in their
gardens, but they bear no fruit without they be well kept and defended from
cold, and yet for all that they bear very seldom.

The Names.
The tree that bears these fruits, is called in Greek (...): in Latin,
Malus medica, and Malus citria. And albeit the Citron and each of the other are
several trees one from another, as it is plainly to be seen in Matthiolus
Commentaries upon Diosc. li. j. where also it is to be noted in the Citron
tree, that his leaf is finely snipt about ye edges or toothed like a saw, but
the Limo^ and Orange trees, whose leaves be ever green like the Bay tree, are
not indented, but smothe about the edges, so that at the first sight Citron,
Orange and Limon trees, do show like Bay trees, but the pleasant savor and
smell of the leaves, be far unlike the smell of the Bay leaves: these three
trees, I say, be of the Auncientes, all contained under the Citron tree.

The fruits also be all called of the Auncientes by one Greek name (...): in
Latin, Mala citria.

Aureu^ malum, and Malum Hespericum, of some also Nerantzium, of the later
writers Anarantium, and Arantium: in English, an Orange: in French, Pomme
d'Orenge* in high Douche, Pomerantsen: in base Almaigne, Arangie appelen: in
Spanish, Naranzas, the which name seems to be taken from the word,
Narantzium, by the which the Apples were once called, as witnesses, Nica^der.

Cedromelon, and in this Country Citrones, and Mala citria: in French,
Citrons: in English, Citrons: in high Douche, Citrinaten: in base Almaigne,
Citroenen. This kind is called of the Italians, as Musa writes, Limones.

Limones, and Malum Limonium: in English, Limons, in Douche, Limoenen: in
French, Limons: Antonie Musa writes, that the Italians do call this fruit
Citrium malum.

The Nature.
The pill, especially the outward part thereof is hoate and dry.

The pulpe with the juice is cold and dry in the third degree.

The seed is hoate and dry in the second degree, and the leaves be almost of
the same nature.

The Virtues.












Of Musa or Mose tree. Chap. xxxviij.
The Description.
THE Mose tree leaves be so great and large, that one may easyly wrap a child
of twelve months old in them, so that as I think in seeking over the whole
world a man shall not again find a tree having so large a leaf. The fruit
is like a Cucumber most sauerie and pleasant in taste above all other fruits
of ye Country of Leuant.

The Place.
This tree was found by a certain Friar named Andro Thenet, in the Country of
Syria, by the great town Aleph, so called of the first letter of the Hebrew
Alphabet, where as is great resort and traffic of merchants, as well of
Indians, Persians, and Venitians, as of diverse other strange nations.

The Names.
This tree with his fruit is called of Auicen Chap. 495. Musa, and at this
present in Syria Mose: And the Greeks and Christians of ye Country, as also ye
Jews, do say that this was the fruit whereof Adam did eat. This may be the
tree which Pliny describes lib. 12. Cap. 6. called Pala, whose fruit is
called Ariene.

The Nature.
The fruit of Mose tree is hoate and moist.

The Virtues.




Of the Pome Granate. Chap. xxxviij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Pomegranates, the tame and the wild: the fruit of the
tame is three manner of ways, ye one having a sour juice or liquor, the other
is sweet, and the third has the taste of wine.

The Description.
THE tame Pomegranate is not very great, it has many pliant bows or branches,
set with cruel thorns. The leaves be very green and straight or narrow,
like unto willow leaves, but shorter and thicker, with small little red veins
going through them, and hanging by a little red foot stalk. The flowers be
holow like a wine cup or goblet, cut about the brimmes after the fashion of a
star, of the color Scarlet or Vermilion, after them comes the fruit
which is round, and within it is full of graynes of a Crimsin red color, the
which graynes have corners or edges, like the stones called Granati, and
within them lies small stones. The which graynes and beries (by the wonderful
and marvelous work of nature) are with certain thin and yellowish fine
velmes and skins, going betwixt, set and couched in very good order: from
those graynes comes the juice, the which is sower or sweet, or having the
taste of wine. The shell or pyll of the Pomegranate is thin and tender before
it is dry, but being dried, it waxes hard, and of a woodish substance, yellow
within, but without colored like a Chestnut.

there follows no fruit after. The flowers that bring forth fruit are
single, and therefore they are named the tame.

The rind or pill of the Pomegranate, is called in Greek (...): in Latin,
Malicorium, and Sidium.

The Nature.
Pomegranates be cold and somewhat astringent, but not al of a like sort. The
sower are more drying and astringent. The sweet are not so much astringent,
but more moist then the others. Those that be in taste like wine, are
indifferent.

The Virtues.
Pomegranates (because they engender a little heat and breed wind) are not
very meet to be used in agues.

Iohans Pfersich, which may be Englished, S. John's Peaches, Hasty Peaches, and
Midsomer Peaches.

The tree Persea with his fruit, is not to be reckoned amongst these kinds
(as some think) for Persea is a great tree, like a Pear tree, always green
and lode^ with fruit, as Theophrastus in his fourth book the second Chapter
writes.

The Nature.
The Peache is cold and moist in the second degree. The leaves of the tree
and the kernels of the fruit are hoate and dry, almost in the third degree,
and of a scowring power by means of their bitterness.

The Virtues.














Peache kernelles pownde or beaten very small, and boiled in vinegar until they
dissolve or melte, and become like pappe, is good to be used against the

Of the Pear tree. Chap. xlij.
The Kinds.
THere be diverse sorts of Pears, as well as there be kinds of Apples, whereof
some be rathe ripe, some have a later riping, and some be winter Pears, some
perish quickly, some last a longer time and may be well kept: some be sweet and
full of sap or juice, some fat and gross, and some hard and dry, etc. so
that it is not possible to recite all the kinds of Pears: wherefore we do
advise the Readers to consider the taste more then the proportion, or the time
of the riping of Pears: for the taste does best declare and give notice of the
qualitities and temperature of Pears.

The Description.
THE Pearetree is as great or greater the^ the Apple tree, and higher, with a
great body or stem, and many great branches, the which for the most part
do shute or mount upright, and not one over another, as the branches of the
Apple tree. The leaves be roundish, smoth, and very green above: but
underneath most commonly they be whitish. The fruit for the most part is long,
broad beneath, and narrow, and sharp upward toward the stem, very diverse
or contrary, in color, quantity, proportion, and taste, as is abouesayde. In
the middle of the fruit there is a coare with kernels or peppins, like as in
the midst of the Apples.

The Place.
The Pear tree is planted in gardens and Orchardes: also it grows sometimes
in woods and wild vntoyled places, but they be none otherwise esteemed, but as
wildings or wild hedge Pears.

All kinds of Pears are of a cold temperature, and the most part of them be
dry and binding, but not all alyke: for the wild Pears, and others that be
rough, binding, and chokely, do dry and stop a great deal more then the
others. The sweet and grouse Pears, are moystier and very little astringent or
nothing at all. The middle sort of Pears which are betwixt sweet and sower,
are of complexion or temperature nearest to them unto whom their taste draws
nearest.

The Pearetree leaves are cold of complexion, dry and astringent, as Galen
says.

barks of them which be also bitter in taste.

The Place.
The Mulberie tree rejoices in the garden soil, and other hoate and fat
manured places.

The Time.
The Mulberie tree brings forth his new leaves in May, a long time after
other trees. And therefore it is called in the fayning of Poets, the wisest of

THe Sycomore is a great tree like the Mulberie tree, with a great stem or
tronke, and many great limbs and branches. The leaves be much like to the
leaves of ye Mulberie. The fruit is like to a wild fig, but it is without any
small seeds in it, and it grows not upon the young branches as the fruit of
other trees grows, but upon the stock or stem, and the greatest arms of
the tree: also it never waxes ripe unless it be scraped with an iron tool.

Also there is a certain gum or liquor gathered from out of the barks of
the young Sycomore trees, the which is gotten by pearsing the rind or barks
of the young trees, before they have borne any fruit.

The Place.

there comes forth a sap or juice like milk, but being through ripe, the
juice is like to honey.

The Place.
The fig trees are plentiful in Spain and Italy, and are found also
sometimes in this Country, but very rare and seldom, they must be planted in
warm places, that stand well in the Son, and are defended from the North and
Northeast winds.

AMongst the kinds of Plummes (those which are called in Shoppes Sebestens)
may be accounted, the which do also grow upon trees, whereof the body or
stem is covered with a white bark, and the branches with a green pil or
rind. The leaves be roundish. The fruit is not much unlike the least kind of
Damsons or Plummes, but smaller, of a blewishe color and sweet taste, white
within, and of a viscus or clammie substance, in the middle whereof are small
stones with kernelles in them, like to Plumme stones.

The Place.
This fruit grows in Italy, and other hoate regions, from whence it is
brought already dried unto us.

Of Cherries. Chap. l.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Cherries, great and small: the small Cherries do grow
upon high trees, and the greater Cherries upon mean trees. And of every kind
there be two fortes, some red, some black. Bysides these kinds there are
Cherries that grow, three, four, and five upon a stem, and also that hang in
clusters like grapes, whereof of the learned Matthiolus has given us the
figures.

The Description.




Cerasia. Sweet Cherries. Cerasa Racemosa. Cluster Cherries. Cerasa austera.
Sower Cherries.




Out of al these Cherrie trees, there issues gum like that of the Plumme
trees, or Peache trees, especially when the rind or bark is any ways hurt or
bruised.

The Place.
The tree that bears the sweet Guyan Cherries, or the great French Cherries
is planted in gardens and Orchardes. But that which bears the Mazars, or ye
small Cherries grows in some places very plentifully in feeldes and wooddes.

Matthiolus writes that about Trent a City in Italy, about the City of Prage
in the Country of Bohem, and about Vienna in the Country of Austrige, there
grow naturally wild Cherries upon low bushes or shrubbes, of little more
then half a fa foot high, and their fruit is in all respects aunswerable to
the other small Cherries.

The Time.
The great French Cherries, and the common Cherries do commonly flower in
April. The red Cherries are ripe in June, and continue until July: but the
black wax ripe in July, and they may be kept fresh and whole unto the end of
August.

The Names.
The Cherrie tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Cerasus: in high Douch,
Kirschenbaum: in base Almaigne, Kerseboo^: in French, Cerisier: and Guisnier.

The fruit likewise is called (...), Cerasa: in English, Cherries, in French,
Guinnes in high Douche, Kirschen: in base Almaigne, Kersen.

And for the better declaration both of the names and kinds of Cherries, I
have thought good to give you to understand, what I have conceived of this
matter. I read in Matthiolus, that the common people of Italy do call the
waterishe Cherries Acquaiuola. The famous learned man Robertus Stephanus in his
French Dictionarie, does turn this French word Guisnes into Latin, as
follows (Aquitanica cerasa) which sounds in English, Guyan Cherries, now
whether the people of Italy do call Guyan Aquitan, I refer that to them that
be expert in that language. But the French word seems to have his first
original of the Country Guyan, for they expound Cerasia, Guisnes doulces,
Sweet Cherries.

Grosses guisnes, Duracina cerasa, Hard Cherries.

Guisnes noires, Cerasia Actiana, Small Cherries like Eldren beries.

Guisnes fort rondes, Cerasia Caeciliana, Round Cherries.

Guisnes fort rouges, Cerasia Aproniana, Grape or cluster Cherries: so that
Guisnes is their proper word for all sorts of Cherries, except sower
Cherries, which they call Griotes: in Latin, Cerasia acida.



Chamaecerasus: yet it is not that Chamaecerasus whereof Asclepiades Myrleanus
writes, the fruit whereof makes men dronken like wine. The Brabanders name
this tree Spaensche Kerselaer, and the fruit Spaensche Kersen, that is to say,
Spanish Cherries, or Cherrie tree: in French, Guinnier, and Guinnes: in
English, French Cherries, and Spanish Cherries: they be also called in
French, Cueurs: and they that be half white Bigarreans.

Cerasus, and therefore the fruit is likewise called Cerasa, of some Merendae,
or Marenae: Platina writes of one Moretum ex Merendis, Cordus writes of one
compounde named Diamarenatum, and both these are made of Cherries.

The Nature.
All Cherries and Mazars, are cold and moist of temperature, but above all the
rest the sower Cherries do cool most, and specially those that be black,
which are also astringent, especially being dried.

The Virtues.










The water distilled of fresh and new gathered Cherries, is good to be powered
into the mouths of such as have the falling evil, as often as the course or
fit troubles them, for it is good against the rigor and violence of the same.

Of the Hasel or Fylberde tree. Chap. lviij.
The Kinds.
There be two sorts of Hasel, or wood Nut trees: the one kind is set and
planted in gardens, the other grows wild.

Corylus hortensis. The Fylberde.


Corylus syluestris. The Hasel Nut.


The Description.
THe Hasel and Fiberde trees, are but small growing like to a hedge plant, and
put forth from the root (which is much displayed and spread abroad) many
straight rods, shutes or springes, of which oftentimes some wax thick and
long and full of branches, and some wax long and flender, and are very fit to
make rods or poles to fish with, because they be firm and plyant, and will
not lightlybreake. The leaves be broad and wrinckled somewhat hact or snipt
round about, the which leaves spring forth after the Catkins, agglettes, or
blowinges, which hang upon the Hasell tree be fallen of: betwixt the leaves
comes the fruit, growing three or four together in a cluster, somewhat, but
not altogether covered with a husk or pil. Their shales be hard and
wooddishe, in which the round kernel or Nut is enclosed, and is ouercouered
with a smooth tender husk or skin, like to other Nuttes, the which is red in
the Filberdes, and white or pale in Hasel Nuttes.

The Place.
The Fylberdes are planted in gardens.

But the wild grows in wooddes and moist places that be dark and shadowie.

The Time.
The Aglets or Catkens of Hasel, break forth in winter, and in the spring
time they open into small rags or scales, shortly after the leaves appear.
The Nuttes be ripe in August.

The Names.
This tree or shrub is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Nux auellana, and of
Virgil, Corylus: in French, Couldre, and Noisetier: in high Douch,
Haselstrauch, and Haselnuszbaum: in base Almaigne, Haselaer: in English, Hasel
or Filberd tree.

The Nut is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Nux Pontica, Nuxauellana, Nux
praenestina, and Heracleotica: in French the great and round kind is called
Auelines, and the small and long kind, is called Noisilles, and Noisettes: in
English, the great and long kind is called Filberdes, and the round kind
with the hard thick shale, is called the Wood nut, or Hasel nut.

The red Filberdes are called in French, Auelines rouges: in high Douch,
Rhurnusz, and Rotnusz: in base Almaigne, Roode Haselnoten. They be the right
Nuces Ponticae described of the Auncientes.

The Nature.
The Hasell nuttes and Fylberdes are in complexion not much unlike the
Walnuttes, but dryer although they be yet new and green: but when the be old
and dry, they be colder then Walnuttes.

The Virtues.








Of Fistick Nuttes. Chap. lix.
The Description.
THE tree that brings forth Fistick Nuts, has long great leaves spread
abroad, and made of five, seven, or more leaves, growing one against another all
along a reddish ribbe or sinewe, whereof the last which is alone at the top
of the leaf is the greatest or largest, the fruit of this tree is much like
to small Hasel Nuttes, and like the kernels of ye Pine Apple, in which lies ye
kernel or nut.

The Place.
This tree is a stranger in this Country, and is not found but only in ye
gardens of diligent Herboristes, but it comes of plants in Syria, and other
hoate Regions.

Arbor Pistaciorum.


The Names.

Of the Bladder Nut. Chap. lx.
The Description.
THis kind of Nut is a wild fruit, whereof men make none account, growing upon
trees, which grow most commonly like shrubbes, or hedge busshes, as many other
wild sorts of trees do. This tree his leaves are made of five blades or more,
not much unlike the Elder leaf, but smaller and grener. The flowers be white
round and double, growing five or six together, after them come the round
holow bladders, divided into two or three parts, in which be found most
commonly two little Nuttes, whereof the kernel is meetely sweet.

The Place.
This plant is no where found, but growing wild, there is plenty of it found
wild in Almaigne, and sometimes also in the hedges of this Country.

The Time.
The small flowers do blow in May: and the Nuttes are ripe in September.

Staphilodendron Plinij. Nux vesicaria.


The Names.
This wild tree is called of Pliny in Greek (...): and in Latin,
Staphilodendron: of them that write now Nux Vesicaria, and of some Pistacium
Germanicum, although it is very little like the Fistick Nuttes.

The fruit is called of the high Douchemen, Pimpernusz: of the base Almaignes,
S. Antuenis Nootkens: yt is to say in English, S. Antonies Nuts.

The Nature and Virtues.
As touching the natural virtues and operations of this kind of Nuttes, we
can say nothing, because they serve to no purpose at al.

Of Cytisus / or tree Trifoly. Chap. lxi.
The Description.
CYtisus is a shrubbe or bush with leaves, not much unlike Fenugreke, or Seen,
the flowers be fair and yellow, almost like to Broom flowers: yt which past

It flowreth in May, and the sede is ripe in August.

The Names.
This bushy shrubbe is named of Theophrastus in Greek (...): of Theodor Gaza,
Coloutea or Colutea: in English of some Cytisus bush, and tree Trifoly, but of
the ignorant sort, it is falsely called Seen: in French, Baguenaudier, and des
Bagenaudes: in high Douch, Welsch Linsen: in base Almaigne, Lombaertsche
Linsen, and of the ignorant people improperly Seneboom.

Colutea Theophrasti. Cytisus Latinorum.


The Nature.
The leaves and seed of the Cytish bush are temperate of heat and moisture.

The Virtues.
The fruit, that is to say the seed, and also ye leaves of Colutea, or
Cytisus, as Theophrastus writes, does fat Sheep very quickly, and causes
them yield abundance of milk.

Of the Date tree. Chap. lxij.
The Description.
THE Date trees be great, with a straight thick stem or tru^cke, covered
with a scaly bark. At the top thereof grow many long branches, with great
plenty and store of long straight narrow leaves, or twigges like Reeds, so
that the said branches seem to be none other thing, but a bundel or sort of
Reed leaves, growing thick together upon one branch: amongst those branches
grows Palma.
the fruit clustering together at the first, and lapped in a certain long and
broad forrell or covering like to a pyllowe, the which afterward does cleeue
abroad and open it self, showing forth his fruit, standing along by
certain Sions or small springes, growing al out of a flat and yellow branche
like to the timber or wood of a Harp: the same fruit is round and long, with
a certain long and very hard stone in the same. And it is to be noted that
the male Palm tree brings forth nothing else but the flower or blossom
which vanishes away, but the female bears the fruit, which afterward
comes to ripeness.

The Place.
The Date tree grows in Africa, Arabia, India, and Syria, Judea, and other
Countries of the East or Orient.

The Time.

The Virtues.










Of Anagyris, Laburnum, and Arbor Judah. Chap. lxvi.
Anagyris.


Laburnum.


The Description.
Agnus castus. The flowers be yellowe almost like to Broom flowers, which
being past, there come up long husks or coddes, in which is a flat fruit or
seed that is hard and firm, almost like the kidney beans, but somewhat
smaller. The whole plant is of a strong ill-favored stinking savor, as it were
the smell of Gla. din or Spurgewort.

Arbor Judah.




Aristolochia clematitis, or Asarum, but stronger. The flowers be purple and
read, like to the flowers of garden or branche Peason, and the said flowers
do not grow upon the small branches, and betwixt the leaves like the blossoms,
and flowers of other trees, but they grow about the lowest part of the great
branches, the which afterward do change into long flat coddes of color
somewhat blew or wanne, having a certain flat seed within, which is hard and
like to a Lentill.

The Place.
These plants do grow wild in diverse places of Italy and Province, in
wooddes and upon the mountains.

The Time.
Anagyris flowreth in April and May: the other in May, and June: but Arbor
Judah in March. The fruit is ripe in September.

The Names.
Anagyris: in Italian, Eghelo: we may call it Bean trifoly, because the leaves
grow three together, and the seed is much like to a bean: the French name
may be Bois puant.

Laburnum Plinij: This is not Anagyris, neither yet Lotus, as some do
wrongfully judge it.

Arbor Judah, and Arbor Iudae: this should seem to be a kind of Laburnu^, or as
some men think (...), Colytea of Theophrastus, This is not that Cercis of
Theophrastus, for Cercis is a kind of Populer, the which Pliny calls
Populus Lybica.

The Nature.
The leaves and seed of Anagyris are hoate and dry of complexion.

The Virtues.






Of Withy or Willow. Chap. lxvij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Withy very diverse. The one rises up very high and
grows to the bigness and thickness of other trees: the other remains
always low, bears Ozier rods and twigges. The bark of the first sort is
sometimes reddish, sometimes white and sometimes yellowe.

The Description.




The Place.
All kinds of Withy delight to grow in moist places, along by diches and
waters, but especially the Oziers.

Salix.


The Time
Withy flowreth at the beginning of the spring time: his flower or blossom is
like a fine throm or thick set velvet heaped up together about a little
stem, the which when it opens is soft in handling, and like down or
Cotton, and therefore the whole flower is called a Chatton, Kitekin or Catteken.

The Names.
Withy is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Salix: in French, Saulx: in high
Douche, Weydenbaum: in base Almaigne, Wilghe boom: Theophrastus does surname it
(...), Olesicarpos, that is to say in Latin, Frugiperda, because his Cattekins
or blossoms do fall away before that his seed be scarce ripe.

Salix perticalis.

Salix nigra, Salix purpurea, and Salix Gallica: in English, Red Withy, and the
better sort thereof is called Red sperte: in French, L'ozier: in high Douche,
Rotweiden: in base Almaigne, Roode wilghen, of some also, Salix viminalis:
because the twigges be tough and plyant, and will be wrought and writhed more
easily then any of the other kinds of Withy, insomuch that this kind of black
or rather red Withy, is without doubt, of the self same kind as the Frank
Ozier is of: for if you plant it in low waterishe places, and cut it hard by
the ground, it will turn to Ozier Withy.

Salix candida, and of some Salix Graeca: in English, Dunne Withy, and Goore
Withy.

Salix vitellina: and after the mind of some, Salix amerina: these two kinds
are called in high Douche, Weisz weiden: in base Almaigne, Wit wilghen, that
is to say, White Withy: it is called about Parris, Du Bursauli: in English,
Cane Withy.

Salix pumila, and Salix viminalis: of Columella, Sabina salix, and Amerina
salix: in French, Franc Ozier: in high Douch, Klein weiden: in base Almaigne,
Wijmen: in English, the small Withy, the Osyar Withy, the Sperte or twigge Withy.

The Nature.
The leaves, flowers, seed, and barks of Withy, are cold and dry in the
second degree, and astringent.

The Virtues.








Of the Oak tree. Chap. lxviij.
The Description.
THe Oak is a great, broad, and thick tree, most commonly spreading his great
branches abroad, and also growing up into height and length. The bark is gray
and smooth whiles it is young, but thick rough uneven chapt and cracte when it
is old. The leaves be deeply cut and natched round about, upon the which
there is sometime found growing in this Country little small Apples, called
Oak Apples, like as in other Countries galls be found growing upon the Oken
leaves, whereof these little Apples be one kind. The fruit of the Oaks are
certain Mast or kernelles hanging forth of rough husks, which be round and
hollow like unto cups or dishes. His root spreads abroad very long and
large.

Besides these kinds of galls and Apples that are upon the Oken leaves, there
grow upon the Oak diverse other things, as Theophrastus writes, more at
large, in his History of plants the iij. book, and viij. Chapter.

The Place.
The Oak loves sandy grounds, lean, and dry, as upon palynes and heathes.

The Time.
The Oak renueth his leaves in May. The Acornels or mast is ripe in August: the
Oak apples do grow in summer, and do begin to fall in September.

The Names.
The Oak is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Quercus: in high Douche,
Eichbaum: in base Almaigne, Eyckenboom.

The fruit is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Glans: in English, an Akernel,
or mast: in French, Gland: in high Douch, Eichel: in base Almaigne, Eeckel.

The round berie or apple which grows upon the leaves, is called in Greek
(...): in Latin, Galla: in French, Noix galle: in high Douch, Eichopffel, and
Galopffel: in base Almaigne, Eycken apple, and Galnoten.

The shales or cups in which one part of the kernel is enclosed or couched,
is called in Latin, Calices glandium: in shops, Cupul glandiu^.

Quercus.


The Nature.
The leaves and bark of the Oak, as also the cups or shelles of the Acornes,
are dry in the third degree, and astringent. The Acornes be almost of the same
temperature, sauinge that they be warmer, and not so much astringent.

The Gale is cold and dry in the third degree, and very astringent.

The Virtues.












blood, and laskes to be taken in whatsoever manner, whether they be ministered
within the body, or mixed with oils, oyntmentes and emplaisters to be laid
outwardly.









The Oak Apples or greater Galls, being broken in sonder, about the time of
withering do forshewe the sequel of the year, as the expert husbandmen of
Kent have observed by the living things that are found within them: as if
they find an Ante, they judge plenty of grain: if a white worm like a
Gentill, morreyne of beast: if a Spider, they presage pestilence, or some other
like sickness to follow amongst men. Which thing also the learned have noted.
For Matthiolus upon Dioscorides says, that before they be holed or pearsed
they conteyne either a Fly, a Spider, or a Worm: if a Fly be found, it is a
pronostication of war to follow: if a creeping worm, the scarcity of
victual: if a running Spider the Pestilente sickness.

Of Missel or Misselto. Chap. lxix.
The Description.
THIS plant has many flender branches, the which are spread overthwart, and
are wrapped or enterlaced one with another, covered with a bark of a light
green or Popingay color. The leaves be thick and of a dark or brown green
color, greater and longer then the leaves of Box, but otherwise not much
unlike. The flowers be small and yellow, the which being past there appear
small round and white beries, full of clammy moisture of which each berie has
a black kernel, which is the seed.

The Place.
Misselto grows not upon the ground, but upon trees: and is oftentimes found
growing upon Apple trees, Pear trees, Mythies, and sometimes also upon the
Linden, Birche, and other trees; but the best and of greatest estimation, is
that which grows upon the Oak.

Viscum.


The Time.
Misselto flowreth at the end of May, and the fruit is ripe at the end of
September, the which remains all the winter.

The Names.
This plant is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Viscum: in shoppes, Viscus
quercinus: in English, Missell and Misselto: in French, Guy: in high Douch
Missel, and Eichen Missel: in base Almaigne, Marentacken.

The Nature.
The leaves and fruit of Misselto are hoate and dry, and of merely subtle
parts.

The Virtues.










Of the Ash tree. Chap. lxx.
The Kinds.
AFter the mind of Theophrastus, there be two kinds of Ash: the one called
the Ash tree, without any other addition. The other is called the wild Ash,
or white Ash.

Fraxinus. The Ash tree.


Fraxinus bubula, Ornus. Wild Ash.


The Description.




The Place.
The Ash delights in moist places, as about the brinkes and borders of
rivers, and running streams.

The wild Ash grows upon high mountains, and also in shadowy wooddes.

The Time.
The Ash seed is ripe at the end of September.

The wild Ash flowreth in May, the fruit thereof is ripe in September.

The Names.
Fraxinus: in English, Ash: in French, Fresne: in high Douche, Eschernbaum,
Eschernholtz, and Steyneschern: in base Almaigne, Esschen, and Esschenboom.

The husks or fruit thereof are called in shoppes Lingua auis, and Lingua
passerina: in English, Kytekayes.

Fraximus bubula: Pliny, and Columella calls it Ornus, and Fraxinus
syluestris: some of the later writers, calls it Fraxinea arbor: and some call
it Sorbus aucuparia: as well because it has leaves like unto the Sorbe tree, as
also because the Birders, and Fowlers do use the fruit thereof, as bait to
take Birds withal: in English, Quickebeame, feelde Ash, wild Ash, and white
Ash: in French, Fresne Champestre, or sauuage: in high Douche, Malbaum, and
grosser Malbaum, in base Almaigne, Haueresschen, and Qualster.

The Nature.
The leaves and rind of the Ash, are of a temperate heat, and subtle parts
or substance.

The seed is hoate and dry in the second degree.

The wild Ash leaves be also hoate and dry, and of subtle parts.

Of the kinds of Popler and Aspe. Chap. lxxi.
The Kinds.
THe Popler is of three sorts, as winesseth Pliny: the one is called white,
the other black, and the third is called Aspe: the which three kinds are
very common in this Country.

Populus alba. White Popler.


Populus nigra. Black Popler. Populus Lybica. Aspe.


The Description.


Populeum.



The Place.
These trees do grow in low moist places, as in meadows, and near unto
diches, standing waters, and rivers.

The Time.
Vnguentum Populeon.

The Names.
The white Popler, is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Populusalba, and of
some Farfarus: in English, White Popler, or Pepler: in French, Aubeau: in
high Douche, Pappelbaum, Weiszalberbaum, and Weisz Popelweyden: in base
Almaigne, Abeelboome^, and of some ignorant people in Latin, Abies, and that
very erroniously, for Abies is yt Pineappie tree, whereof we shall declare
hereafter.

Populus nigra: in English, Black Popler: in French, Peuplier: in high
Douche, Aspen, and Popelweiden: in base Almaigne, Populier, and Popelaere.

Populus Lybica: in French, Tremble: in base Almaigne, Rateleer: in English,
Aspe.

The Nature.
The leaves and bark of Popler are temperate in heat and cold, nevertheless
they be somewhat dry and abstersive or clensing.

The buds of the black Popler, are hoate and dry in the first degree, and of
subtle parts.

The Virtues.








Of the Elm. Chap. lxxij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Elm, as Theophrastus and Columella have written: the
one grows in feeldes; and the other on mountains.

The Description.


Vlmus.






The Place.






The Time.
The seed of the Elm grows, and afterward falls about the end of
April, when the leaves begin to spring.

The Names.
The Elm is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Vlmus: in English, an Elm tree:
in high Douche, Rustholtz, Rustbaum, Vlmenbaum, Lindbast, and Yffenholtz: in
base Almaigne, Olmboom: in French, Ormee.

Vlmus: of Pliny, Vlmus palustris: of Columella, Vlmus vernacula, and Vlmus
nostras, that is to say, the Elm of Italy, and our common Elm.

Montiulmus: of Columella, Atinia, and Vlmus Gallica: in Picardie, and Artois,
Ypreau:

The seed of the Elm is called in Latin, Samera.

The worms that engender in the bladders or blisters of the Elm leaves, with
the liquor that is contained in the same, are called in Greek (...), Cnipes: in
Latin, Culices, and Muliones.

The liquor is called of the later writers, Gummi vlmi, that is to say, The
gum of the Elm.

Colytea: this should seem to be Vlmus syluestris, whereof Pliny makes
mention: in French, Hestre, it may be called also in French, Orme sauuage: it
is called in high Douche, Hanbuchen, and Bucheschern: in base Almaigne,
Herseleer, and in some places Herenteer: I think this not to be the right
Opulus: but the very tree, which we call Witch, and Witch Hassel: in French,
Opier: and is the best kind of Elm to join vines unto, because his branches
be fair and large of a goodly length but not so thick. Read more of Opier in
the lxxx. Chapter of this book.

The Nature.
The leaves and bark of Elm, are somewhat hoate, and astringent.

The liquor that is found in the bladders that grow upon the leaves is dry, and
of a clensing and scowring nature.

The Virtues.














Of the Linden tree. Chap. lxxiij.
The Kinds.
THeophrastus describes two sorts of Linden tree, that is the male and
female. They are both to be found in this Country, but ye female is most
common and better known.

The Description.
Tilia waxes great and thick, spreading forth his branches long and large,
and yielding a great shadow when the Son shines, the bark is brownishe
without, smooth, and plain, but next to the timber it is white moist and
tough, and will easily be wrested, turned, and twisted every way: wherefore it
is the very stuff whereof they make these cords or halters of Barks. The
timber is whitish, plain, and without knottes, and very soft and gentle to
handle: and therefore the coals that be made of this wood, are good to make
go^powder. The leaves be very green and large, somewhat toothed or a little
snipt round about the edges, otherwise not much unlike to Iuie leaves. The
small flowers be whitishe and of a good savor many hanging together from out
of the middle of a little narrow white leaf. The fruit is none other but little
round beries or pellettes growing together in little clusters like to Iuie
beries, in which is contained a small round seed, which is blackish, and
falls out, when the small pellettes or buttons do open and are ripe.

Tilia foemina. The female Linden tree.


Tilia mas) grows also great and thick, and spreads abroad like the other
Linden, the bark whereof is also tough and plyant and serves to make cords
and halters: but it is rougher, thicker, and britteler, grayishe about the small
branches, but whiter then the barks of the common Linden tree, yet not so
white as the branches of Elm. The timber of this Linden is much harder, more
knottie, and yellower then the timber of the other, much like the timber or
wood of Elm, the leaves be broad, not plain, nor even, but rough and a
little cut about the edges, very like to Elmen leaves, saving that upon them
there never grow any small bladders. This tree brings forth fruit very
seldom, and therefore some judge it as barren, it brings forth for his
fruit, many things like to round flat husks clustering together, having a
certain clift or chinke at the end, much like in proportion and quantity to
the husks of the right Thlaspie described in the fifth book and lxij.
Chapter, whereof each hangs alone upon a stem by it self.

The Place.
The Linden tree loves a good convenient soil, and it grows lightly where
as it is planted. One kind of Linden grows by Colchester in Essex, in the
park of one master Bogges.

The Time.
It flowreth in May, and the fruit is ripe at the end of August.

The Names.
This tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Tilia: in English, Linden: in
French, Tillen, or Tillet in high Douche, Linden, and Lindenbaum: in base
Almaigne, Linde, and Lindeboom.

Tilia foemina, that is to say, the female Lynden.

Tilia mas, that is the male Lynden: some call it in French, Hestre: and in
base Almaigne, Ypelijne.

The Nature.
The bark and leaves of Linden are of temperate heat, and somewhat drying and
astringent, almost in complexion like to the Elm.

Of the Plane tree. Chap. lxxiiij.
Platanus. The Plane tree.


Aceris species, folio maiori. A kind of Maple with the greater leaf.


The Description.




The Place.




The Time.
The Plane tree flowreth about the end of March, and so does the other also.

The Names.
Platanus: in French, Platane.

Plane: in high Douche, Ahorne, and Waldeschern. But it is not Platanus, but a
kind of Maple, and it should seem to be that kind whith is called in Greek
(...): in Latin, Carpinus. Yet the figure which Matthiolus has given us for
Carpinus, is more like to a kind of Witch Hassel. Carpinus ab Acere distat,
quod Aceri candida atque neruata materia, Carpino autem flaua crispaque Theo.

The Virtues.








Of the Aller. Chap. lxxv.
The Description.
THE Aller is a high great tree, with many branches, the which will break
quickly, and will not lightly ploy nor bend. The rind of this tree is
brown. The timber is meetely hard, and will last a long season under water,
yea longer then any other kind of timber: And therefore they make piles and
posts for to lay fundations in fennes, and soft marrish grounds, also they are
very good to make pipes, condites, and troughes for the leading along, and
carriage of water under ground: but above ground water will soon rot and
consume it. This timber waxes red, as soon as it is spoiled of his rind, and
likewise when it is old and dry. The leaves be somewhat clammie to handle, as
though they were wet with honey, of fashion roundish, and somewhat wrinckled,
not much unlike the leaves of the Hasell nuttes. The blowinges of Alder are
long tagglets, almost like to the blowinges of Birche. The fruit is round like
to small Olive beris, and compacte or made of diverse scales, set close
together: the which being ripe and dry do open, so as the seed which is
within them falls out and is lost.

Alnus.


The Place.
The Aller delights to grow in low moist woods, and waterish places.

The Time.
The Aller begins to bud, and to bring forth new leaves in April as other
trees do. The fruit is ripe in September.

The Names.
The Aller, or Alder is called in Greek (...): and in Latin, Alnus: in high
Douche, Erlenbaum, and Ellernbaum: in base Almaigne, Elsenboom: in French,
Aulne.

The Nature.
The bark and leaves of Alder, are cold, dry, and astringent.

The Virtues.




Of the Beeche tree. Chap. lxxvi.
The Description.
THe Beeche is a great, high, thick tree, whose leaves be soft, thin,
plain, smooth, and meetely large, almost like the leaves of Popler, but
smaller. The blossoms thereof are naught else, but small yellowish Catkens,
smaller then the Catkens of Birche, but otherwise like. The fruit is triangled
or three cornered Nuttes, in which are sweet kernels. These Nuttes be covered
over with prickly husks or shales, from out of which they fall down when
they be ripe.

The Place.
The Beeche loves a plain open Country, and moisture.

The Time.
The Beeche blows and breaks forth into new leaves, at the end of April
or May. The Nuttes be ripe in September even with the Chesnuttes.

The Names.
The Beeche tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Fagus: in French,
Fouteau: in high Douche, Buchbaum, or Buche: in base Almaigne, Bueckenboe^. The
fruit is now called in Latin, Nuces Fagi: in French, Feign: in base
Almaigne, Buecken nootkens: in English, Beeche maste.

The Nature.
The leaves of Beech do cool. The kernel of the fruit is somewhat moist and
warm.

Fagus.


The Virtues.






Of Birche tree. Chap. lxxvij.
The Description.
THe Birche does often grow to a great high tree, with many branches, which
have many small rods or twigges very limber and pliant, and most commonly
hanging downewarde, and will abide to be bowed easily any way that one list.
The bark of the young twigges and branches is plain and smooth, and full of
sap, and of the color of a Chestnut: but the bark of the body and greatest
branches of the tree is hard without, white, rough, uneven, and broken or
cloven; upon the branches that be of a mean sise or quantity, the bark or
rind is somewhat speckled: under the same bark, next joining to the wood or
timber, there is found another bark that is plain and smooth as paper, so
that in times past it was used to write upon, before that Paper or Parchement
were known or invented. The leaves are meetely broad, and somewhat snipt about,
smaller the^ Beechen leaves, but otherwise not much unlike. The Birche tree
has tagglettes or Chattons for his blossom, like as the Hasell, but much
smaller, in which the seed comes.

The Place.
Birche grows in wooddes, and heathes, and dry commons, and also alongest
the borders of Corn feeldes.

The Time.
Birche puts forth his new leaves in April: in September his small Catkens
and seed is ripe.

The Names.
Birche is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Betula: in French, Bouleau. in
high Douch, Birke^baum: in base Almaigne, Berckenboom.

The Nature and Virtues.
Birche is not used in medicine, wherefore his nature and virtues are not
known: in old time they used the inner thin bark of Birche, in steed of
Paper, and the young twigges and branches thereof to make rods, and besoms,
as they do at this day.

Betula. Birche.


Of black Aller. Chap. lxxviij.
The Description.
THE black Aller grows not like a tree, neither waxes it very great, but it
brings forth many long straight rods, which do divide them selves again
in other small twigges covered with a thin black rind, under the which
there is found another yellowish rind. The timber or wood of these twigges is
whitish, with a brown red pith in the middle. The leaves be broad like the
leaves of Aller, almost like to Cherrie tree leaves, but rounder and browner.
The little flowers be whitish after which come up round beries, which are green
at the first, but afterward red, and black when they are dried, of a strange
unpleasant taste.

The Place.
This kind of wood grows in low wooddes and moist places.

The Time.
It flowreth in April, and the beries be ripe in August.

The Names.
This plant is called of the Brabanders, Sporckenhout, and of the children of
this Country, Pijlhout, that is to say, bolt timber, or arrow wood, because
they make Arrows with it, to shoot withal: in high Douch, Faulbaum, and
Leuszbaum: of some of ye later writers, in Latin, Alnus nigra, that is to say
in English, Black Aller.

The Nature.
The inner bark of this wood is yellow, and of a dry complexion.

The Virtues.






Alnus nigra quibusdam.


Of Spindel tree / or Prick timber. Chap. lxxix.
The Description.
THis plant grows neither high nor great like a tree, but remains small
and low, putting forth many branches. The stemmes of ye old branches are
covered with a whitishe bark, and the younger branches are covered with a
green rind or bark, having as it were four straight lines running alo^gst
the young shutes or branches, the which do make a quadrature, or a division of
the said young branches into four square parts or cliftes. The timber is
hard of a whitishe yellow. The leaves be long, and somewhat large, soft, and
tender. The small flowers be whitish, and ha^ging five or six together, after
them come small round husks four joining together, ye which do open when the
fruit is ripe: In every of the aforesaid husks, is found a sede or kernel
covered with a fair yellowe skin, which being soked in water or any other
liquor will stain and die yellow.

The Place.
Spindeltree grows in this Country alongest the feeldes in hedges and woods.

Euonymos Theophrasti.


The Time.
It flowreth in April, and the fruit is ripe in September.

The Names.
This plant seems to be that same, which Theophrastus calls in Greek (...),
Euonymos: some call it in Latin, Fusaria, and Fusanum: in English,
Spindeltree, and Prick timber: because the timber of this tree serves very
well to the making both of Pricks and Spindelles: in French, Fusain, Couillon
de Prestre, and Bois a fair Lardoires: in high Douch, Spindelbaum, and
Hanhoedlin: in Brabant, Papenhout. This is not (...), Zygia, or Iugalis, or a
kind of Acer, as some do think.

The Virtues.


Of Marris Elder / Ople / or Dwarffe Plane tree. Chap. lxxx.
The Description.




The Place.
This plant grows by water courses, and in low waterish places.

The Time.
It flowreth in May, and the fruit is ripe in September.

Sambucus palustris recentioribus.


The Names.
This plant is called of the later writers in Latin, Sambucus palustris, and
Sambucus aquatica, that is to say, Marrishe Elder, or Water Elder, because of
the flowers and fruit, also the timber is full of pith, like Elder. Cordus
calls it Lycostaphylos: some make it Chamaeplatanus: it is called in French,
Obiere, or Opiere: in high Douche, Schwelder, and Bacholder: in Brabant,
Swelken, and Swelkenhout. This is not Opulus, as some do think: it may be well
called in English, Dwarffe Plane tree: I take this to be a shrub that is called
in English, Whittentree, whereof are two kinds, one in all points agreeable
with Sambucus palustris, the other alters in leaf: for his leaves be like to
Elm or Witch Hassel, and this kind is very tough and flexible.

The Virtues.
Some will say, that the beries of Whittentree, taken into the body, will cause
vomit and open the belly: but it has not hitherto been found true, of any
learned and expert Doctors.

Of Frangula Matthioli.

Matthiolus has joined to his Eldrens, a certain plant, growing in Bohem,
called Frangula, ye. which I have thought good also to place in this book for
the great proffite, which my Country men may have by the knowledge of the same.

The Description.
FRangula is a tree of a mean stature, the leaves are almost like to the
Cornel, and Houndestree leaves, the bark is like to the bark or rind of
Aller, speckled on the outside with white spots: but the inner rind is so
yellow, that if it be chewed it will color, and stayne yellow like saffron and
Rubarbe. It puts forth white flowers, and small fruit or beries, of the
bigness of a pease so divided in the middle, that it seems to be two beries
by natures skill joined together. At the first the fruit is green, then red,
and at last black, having within two small stones, almost like Lupines, but
little bigger then Lentilles, in which the kernels be. The substance of the
timber is very brittle and frail, whereof it took his name in Latin,
Frangula. There is no small virtue in the bark or rind, both to loose and
bind. for it loses the belly and strengthens the principal parts, even
like Rubarbe. It purges choler and fleme, and dispatcheth the water from
such as have the dropsy. The said bark is boiled with common Eupatorie,
Pontike wormwood, Agrimonie, Epithim, Hoppes, Cinamome, Fenill, Parsley, and
both kinds of Endive with their roots, against the dropsy, and evil
disposition of the body, and the Iaunders: it is given to them that be sick of
the aforesaid diseases, in the quantity or weight of five ounces with
singular profit. But it shall be very requisite, that first the superfluity of
humors, which lie in the stomach, and the first veins of the liver be
pourged. It loses the belly without any danger, and does very well purge and
strengthen the liver, so that such as have been grieved with the hardness of
the milt and liver, have been cured only with this medicine: for it opens
all the stoppinges of the bowels and entrayles, and cleanses all the
instrumental parts from gross excrements. The uttermost bark is astringent:
and the inner bark loses. Both ought to be stripped from the tree, in the very
beginning of the spring time, and then to be dried in the shadow for if it be
occupied green, it will cause vomiting. The decoction that is made with it,
ought to stand or rest two or three days before it be ministered, until the
yellow color be changed into black, else it may peradventure cause vomiting.
The same dronken before the unloosing of the belly provoke appetite. And.
Matthioli Comm. in lib. 4. Dioscoridi.

Of Maple. Chap. lxxxi.
The Description.
MAple grows sometimes like a tree, both high and thick, with many great
branches: sometimes it grows low, like a shrub. The bark is thick and
somewhat white. The timber is hard, and garnished with long streaming waves,
or water veins. The leaves be broad, with five peakes or corners, like the
leaves of Ople bushe, or Dwarffe Plane tree, but smaller and greener very like
the leaves of Sanicle. The fruit is long, flat, and thin, almost like to a
feather of a small bird, or like the whing of a grasshopper.

The Place.
Maple grows in wooddes, where as it comes to a great tree, and along by
diches and running streams, where as it is but small.

The Time.
It blows in May, and the seed is ripe in September.

The Names.
This tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Acer, and it should be that
kind which is called in Greek (...), that is to say, Campestris, and of some,
as Theophrastus writes, (...), of Pliny, Gallica: in English, Maple: in
French, Erable. in high Douch, Maszholder: in Brabant Booghout, and Vlierhout.

The Virtues.
Serenus Sa^monicu: has written.

Aceris species, Folio minori.


Of the Juniper tree. Chap. lxxxij.
The Kinds.
THere be two fortes of Juniper, as Dioscorides writes, whereof the one kind
grows great and high. The other kind remains small and low, and is well
known in this Country.

The Description.




The Place.
Juniper is found upon high mountains, in shadowy woods, and low holow ways,
it loves a cold stony ground.

The Time.
In the month of May there arises out of Juniper a certain yellow powder or
dust, which is taken for the blowing or flower of Juniper, after that you shall
perceive the small beries to begin to grow up, the which do wax ripe in
September, a year after that they begin first to grow up. Therefore ye shall
find upon the Juniper tree, beries both ripe and unripe, great and small al
together.

The Names.
Juniper is called in Greek (...), and of some (...): in Latin, Iuniperus: in
French, Ieneure, or Geneure: in high Douch, Weckholder, and Weckholterbaum: in
Brabant, Geneuer.

The beries be called in Greek (...): in Latin, Baccae Iuniperi: in shops,
Grana Iuniperi: in English, Juniper beries: in French, Grains de Geneure: in
high Douch, Weckholterbeeren, and Kromerbeeren.

The gum which sweateth out of this tree and his bark, is called in shops,
Vernix: and in some places not without great and dangerous error, Sandaraca:
for the right Sandaraca is a gnawing, and venomous substance, which is found
in the mines of mettalles whereunto this gum is nothing like.

Iuniperus.


The Nature.
The Juniper tree with all his parts, as leaves, bark, timber, fruit, and
gum is of complexion hoate and dry.

The Virtues.












Vernix, is good for the brain, dries up the superfluous humors of the head,
and stops the falling down of reume or humors from the same.



Of Cedar tree. Chap. lxxxiij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Cedar, great and small. The small fruit also is of two
sorts: the one with sharp prickley leaves like Juniper: the other are not
prickley at all.

The Description.


Oxycedrus.






The Place.
The great Cedar grows in Africa and Syria, and as Vitruuius reports also
in Candie, upon the high mountains, and places that be cold and moist,
which are commonly covered with snow, as upon the mountains Libanus,
Amanus, and Taurus, as Belon writes.





The Time.




The Names.
Cedar is called in Greek (...): in Latin Cedrus: in English, Cedre, and
Cedar: in French, Cedre: in Douche, Cederboom.

Cedrus mayor, and Cedrus Conifera: in French, Grand Cedre.

The liquer that flows out of this tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin
also Cedria, and liquor Cedrinus: of Auicen, Serbin: of Serapio, Kitran: with
this liquor in old time they did use to enbaulme the bodies of dead men, the
which at this time is taken out of the graves or Sepulchers, and Sold in
Shops in steed of Mumia, not without great and manifest error. For that
which the Arabians do call Mumia, is called in Greek Pissasphaltos.

Acuta Cedrus, Cedrus Phoenicia, Oxycedrus, and Cedrula: in French, Petit
Cedre.

Cedrus Lycia: and in Province, as Peter Belon writes, Moruenic.

The Nature.
Cedria, which runs forth of the great Cedar tree, is almost whoate in the
fourth degree, and of subtle parts.



The Virtues.






Cedria: for it keeps the same whole, and preserves them from corruption: but
it consumes and corrupts living flesh.





Of Sauine. Chap. lxxxiiij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Sauine, one with leaves much like Tamariske, the other
like to the leaves of Cypres.

The Description.




Sabina. Sauin.


The Place.




The Time.
The fruit of the Sauin tree is ripe at the beginning of winter.

The Names.
Sabina: in Shoppes, Sauina, of some Sauimera: in English, Sauin: in French,
Sauinier: in high Douch, Seuenbaum: in base Almaigne, Sauelboom.

Sabina, and of Pliny, Cupressus cretica: it should seem to be the tree which
Theophrastus calls in Greek (...), Thuia, vel Thuium, and Pliny Bruthes, or
Bruta, as Peter Belon, has very well left in writing.

The Nature.
The leaves of Sauin which are most used in medicine, are hoate and dry in the
third degree, and of subtle parts.

The Virtues.


and eating sores: they do scour and take away all spots and speckles from
the face or body of man.





Of the Cypres tree. Chap. lxxxv.
The Description.
THE Cypres tree has a thick, straight, long stem, upon which grow many
slender branches, the which do not spread abroad, but grow up in length
toward the top, so that ye Cypres tree is not broad, but narrow, growing to
a great height. The bark of the Cypres tree is brown, the timber yellowishe,
hard, thick, and close, and when it is dry, of a pleasant smell, especially
being set near the fire. The Cypres tree has no particular leaves, but the
branches in steed of leaves bring forth short twigges green and small,
divided again into other small twigges, the which be cut and snipt in many
places, as if they were set about with many small leaves. The fruit is round
almost as big, as a prune or plumme, the which being ripe does open in diverse
places, and has in it a flat grayishe seed, the which is much desired of
Emotes, Antes, or Pismiers.

The Place.
The Cypres tree delights high mountains, and dry places. It will not
lightly grow in low moist places.

The Time.
The leaves of Cypres be always green. The fruit is ripe in September even
at the beginning of winter.

Cupressus.


The Names.
This tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Cupressus: in Shops,
Cypressus: in English, Cypres, and Cypres tree: in French, Cypres: in high
Douche, Cypressenbaum: in base Almaigne, Cypressenboom.

The fruit is called in Latin, Nuces Cupressi, Pilulae Cupressi, and of some
Galbuli: in Shoppes, Nuces Cupressi: in English, Cypres Nuttes: in French, Noiz
de Cypres.

The Nature.
The fruit and leaves of Cypres are dry in the third degree, without any
manifest heat, and astringent.

The Virtues.


















Of the Yew tree. Chap. lxxxvi.
The Description.
THE Ewe is a great high tree, remaining always green, it has a great
stem, covered with a graye bark, that is cloven and scabbed or scalye. The
leaves be of a dark green, long, and narrow like a fether, set full of small
leaves, growing al along a stem, opposite or standing right over one
against another, whereof each leaf is narrow, and longer then the leaves of
Rosemarie, otherwise not much unlike. His fruit is fair round read beries,
somewhat bigger than whortes, but else not much unlike.

The Place.
Ewe grows in Arcadia, Italy, Spain, France, and Almaigne: also in the
forest of Ardein. In time past it was planted in garde^s for Tamariske.

The Time.
The fruit of Ewe is ripe in September.

The Names.
This tree is called in Greek (...), of Theophrastus (...): and after Galen
(...), Cactos* in Latin, Taxus: of the ignorant Apothecaries of this Country
Tamariscus: in English, Ewe, or Yew: in French, If. in high Douche, Ibenbaum:
and accordingly in base Almaigne, Ibenboom.

Taxus.


The Nature.
Ewe is altogether venomous, and against man's nature.

The Danger.




stead of the bark of Tamarisk, by this we may well perceive, what wickedness
the ignorant Apothecaries do daily commit by ministering of noughty hurtful
medicines in steed of good to ye great peril and danger of the poor diseased
people.

Of the Pine tree. Chap. lxxxvij.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Pine trees, as the noble Ancient Theophraste writes,
that is to say, the garden, and wild Pine trees; there be also diverse sorts
of the wild Pine tree.

The Description.
THE Pine tree is high and great with many branches at the top, parted into
other round branches, set round about with little hard leaves and almost sharp
pointed or prickly, very straight or narrow, and of a green whitish color.
The timber is red and heavy, and within about the heart, full of sap and
liquor. His fruit is great Boulleans or Bawles of a brown Chestnut color (and
are called Pine Apples) in which grow small nuttes, wherein is a sweet white
kernel, which is sometimes used in medicine.





Pinus.








From out of these trees comes that liquor called Rosen, especially from the
wild trees: and it runs most commonly out of the bark, or from the timber,
but sometimes also it is found in the fruit or apples.

From these trees also comes pitch both liquid and hard, yt which is drawn
forth by burning of ye wood, as Theophrastus teaches. The which manner of
drawing or melting of Pitch, is yet used in Candie, as Peter Belon writes.





The Time.
The fruit or Pine apples, are ripe in September.

The Names.
The Pine is called in Latin, Pinus: in Greek not (...), as diverse of our
later writers do suppose, but (...), as it is evident by Virgils verse in his
vij. book of Aeneidos. Ipsa inter medias flagrantem feruida Pinum Sustinet.
Where as is to be understood by Flagrantem Pinum, teda pinea, as Seruius
writes.

Ouidius in epistolis Heroidum. Vt vidi, vt perij, nec notis ignibus ignibus
arsi:
Ardet vt ad magnos pinea teda deos.
Item fastorum quarto.
Illic accendit geminas pro lampade Pinus.
Hinc Cereris sacris nunc quoque teda datur.
Prudentius in hymno cerei pascalis.
Seu pinus piceam fertalimoniam.
By which verses one may know, that Teda comes of the tree called in Latin
Pinus, into the which, as Theophrastus writes, (...), Peuce is translated so
that by this one may know that Pinus, and Peuce, is but one tree.

Pinus satiua: in English, the garden Pine: in French, Pin: in high Douch,
Hartzbaum, and Kinholtz: in base Almaigne, Pijnboom.

Pinus syluestris, and Pinaster: in English, the wild Pine: in French, Pin
sauuage: in base Almaigne, Wild Pijnboom: of the kinds of wild Pine are
those trees which be called in high Douche; Kijfferholtz, Forenholtz, or
Fuerenholtz, Fichtenbaum, etc.

Aleue, and Elue (as Peter Belon writes) and it seems to be Pinus Tarentina,
whereof Pliny writes.

Mughi: and it may be called in Greek (...): in Latin, Humilis Pinus, or
Pinus terrestris.

Cembri, and Cirmoli. This seems to be that (as Peter Belon writes) which
the French men call Suiffe. This is not Sapinus, for Sapinus is the nether
part of the stem or tronke of the Fur tree, as we shall write hereafter.

Pinus Idea.

Pinus marina: in French, Pin marin.

The fruit of the Pine is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Conus, and Nux
Pinea: in English, a Cone, or Pine Apple: in French, Pomme de Pin: in high
Douche, Zijrbel: in base Almaigne, Pijnappelen.

The Nuttes which are found in the Pine apples, are called in Greek (...). and
of Hippocrates (...): in Latin, Nuces pineae: in English, Pine apple kernels
or Nuttes: in French, Pignons.

The heart or the middle of the timber which is full of liquor, and being kindled
or burned like a tortche is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Teda: And when
the whole tree, or inner substance thereof, is become so fat and full of
liquor, then Theophrastus says, that it is changed into Teda: and then it
dies because it is so full of fat or Oil, even like to a man or beast that is
stuffed or rather stifled in grease and fat: and then are the said trees best,
for the yielding or drawing forth of the Pitche. Wherefore they be much
deceived, that take Teda to be a kind of tree by it self, and do not rather
know it to be a kind of corruption or malady, insident to the Pine tree.

The Nature.
The bark of the Pine tree is dry and astringent, especially the scales of
the Cones or apples, and the leaves be almost of the same complexion.

The kernel of the Nuttes is hoate and moist, and somewhat astringent.

The Virtues.












Of the Pitch tree. Chap. lxxxviij.
The Description.
THe Pitche tree is also of an indifferent bigness and talle stature, but not
so great as the Pine tree, and is always green like the Pine and Fur trees,
his timber or wood is nothing so red as the Fur tree. It is also fat and
Roseny, yielding Rosen of diverse sorts. The branches be hard and parted into
other spraies, most commonly cross wise, upon which grow small green
leaves, not round about the branches, but by every side, one right over against
another like to little feathers. The fruit is smaller then the fruit of the Pine
tree.

Picea.
(...)

In burning of this wood there flows out Pitche, even like as out of the Pine
tree, as witnesses Dioscorides.

The Place.
This tree grows in many places of Greece, Italy, France, and Germany.

The Time.
The fruit of this tree is also ripe in September.

The Names.
This tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Picea: in high Douche, Rot
thannen, and Rot dannebaum, that is to say, the red Fur tree: and accordingly
in nether Douchlande, it is called Roode Denneboom.

That Pitys and Picea, are but one kind of tree, Scribonius Largus does
sufficiently declare who in the C Cj. Composition writes after this manner.
Resinae pituinae, id est, ex picea arbore.

The Nature and Virtues.
The leaves, bark, fruit, kernelles or nuttes of this tree, are almost of the
same nature, virtues, and operations, as the leaves, barks, fruit, and
kernels of the Pyne tree.

Of Rosen that comes out of the Pine and Pitche trees. Chap. lxxxix.
The Kinds.






The Names.
All the kinds of Rosen are called in Greek (...): in Latin, Resina: in
English, Rosen: in French: Resine: in Douche, Herst.

Resina liquida: in shops of this Country, Resina Pini: in base Almaigne,
Rijnschen, or moruwen Herst, that is to say, liquid Rosen.

Of this kind is that Rosen called of the Ancients in Greek (...): Resina
Colophonia, which was so called, because in time past they brought it from
Colophon (a City of Ionia in Greece, where was the temple of Apollo, called
Clarius, and Homer the famous Poet was borne.) But now the ignorant
Apothecaries, in ye steed thereof do use a kind of dry Pitche to the great
hurt of them that are grieved.

Of this sort is also the Rosen which the Brabanders do call Spieghelherst, the
which is molten with the Son in summer, and remains dry, and may be made
into powder: some call it Resina arida, that is to say, dry Rosen, yet this is
not Resina arida of the Ancientes.

Resina arida: but that which sweateth out of the Pine tree, is called in
Greek (...): Resina pinea: and that which comes out of the Pitche tree,
(...), Resina picea, and Resina pice of some Spagas, as witnesses Pliny.

These two kinds of Rosen, and also the dry Rosen that sweateth out of the
Fur tree, are now a days without discretion, sold in shops for great
incense, and is called of the ignorant Apothecaries Thus, of some Garipot, and
they call the right incense Olibanum, not knowing how that Olibanum, which is
called in Greek (...), and Thus, be but one thing.

Resina strobilina, this kind until this time has been unknown in shoppes.

The Nature.
All the kinds of Rosen are hoate and dry, of a clensing and scouring nature.

The Virtues.




Of Pitche and Tar. Chap. xc.
The Kinds.
THere be two sorts of Pitche: the one moist, and is called liquid Pitche: the
other is hard, and dry, they do both run out of the Pine and Pitche trees, and
of certain other trees, as the Cedar, Turpentine, and Larche trees by burning
of the wood and timber of the same trees as apparteyneth, and as it has been
before expressed.

The Names.
Pitche is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Pix: in French, Poix: in Douche,
Peck.

Pix liquida: in Brabant, Teer: in French, Poix de Bourgongne: in English,
Tar.

Pix arida: in shoppes, Pix naualis: in English, ship Pitche, or stone Pitche:

The Nature.
Pitche is hoate and dry in the second degree, and of meetely subtle parts,
but the stone Pitche is dryest, the liquid Pitche or Tar is the hoater and of
more subtle parts.

The Virtues.














Of the Fur tree. Chap. xci.
The Description.
THE Fur tree is great, high, and long, ever green, growyng much higher
then the Pine and Pitche trees. The stem is very even or straight, plain
beneath, and without joints, but with joints and knoppes above, upon which
joints grow the branches bearing leaves almost like Ewe, but smaller. The
fruit is like to the Pine apple, but smaller and narrower, not hanging down
as ye Pine apple, but growing right upward. With the timber of this tree they
make Mastes for ships, posts, and rayles for diverse other purposes.





Abies Fur.


The Place.
The Fur tree grows upon mountains: and is not only found in Greece,
Italy, Spain, and France, but in Pruse, Pomeran, Lieflande, and diverse other
places of Germany.

The Names.
This tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Abies: in English, Fur: in
French, Sapin* in high Douche, Wesz Thannen, and Weisz Dannenbaum: in base
Almaigne, Wit Denneboom, and Mastboom.

The lower part of the stem of this tree which is without knots or joints, is
called in Latin, Sapinus, and the upper part which is full of joints and
knottes, is called Fusterna, as witnesses not only Pliny, but also Vitruuius
in his second book of Architecture, or buyldinges.

Lachryma abietis, Lachryma abiegna, and of some Abiegna resina liquida, and
Abiegnum oleum: In Italian, Lagrimo in Shoppes of this Country, Terebinthina
veneta, and is sold for the right Turpentine: in English, Turpentine of
Venice: in French, Terebinthine de Venise: in base Almaigne, Veneetsche
Terebenthijn, there be some that think this Rosen to be (...), Oleaosa resina
of Dioscorides.

Resina abiegna, and is also sold in Shoppes for Thus, and Garipot, like the
dry Rosen of the Pine tree.

The Nature.
The bark, as also the dry gum or Rosen of this tree, are in nature and
virtues, like to the bark and dry Rosen of the Pine tree, saving that they be
somewhat more aygre, and clensing.

The liquid or clear Rosen, is hoate and dry in the second degree, and
because of his aygre or sharp quality, it has a digestive and clensing
nature.

The Virtues.






Of the Larche or Larix tree. Chap. xcij.
The Description.
THe Larix tree is great and thick, spreading abroad his slender boughs or
branches, which are very plya^t or limmer. The timber is reddish, thick,
weighty, and very hard, insomuch as fire cannot do it much harm, except it be
burned in ye Furnis with other wood like chalk or white stone. The bark of
this tree is smoother, then ye bark of the Fur tree. The leaves be green,
and small iagged, growing thick together in tuftes like tasselles, and do fall
of at the coming of winter. The fruit is like to Pine apples, saving that it
is much smaller, and not much greater then Cypres Nuttes.

From this tree comes forth a liquor, Rosen, or gum, which is soft,
moist, whitishe, and dark, in substance like honey of Athens, as Vitruuins
writes.

There grows in this kind of trees a kind of Mushrome or Tadstoole, that is
to say, a fungeuse excrescence, called Agaricus, or Agarick, the which is a
precious medicine and of great virtue. The best Agarick is that, which is
whitest, very light, britle, and open or spongious. That which is otherwise,
that is to say, black, thick, close, clammie, and weighty, is not meet for
medicine, but unwholesome and venomous.

Larix.


The Place.
This tree grows in Lombardie, along by the river Padus, and in Silesia
plentifully.

The Time.
This tree has new leaves at the beginning of the spring time. The fruit is
ripe in September.

The Names.
This tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Larix: in some Shops, Larga:
in high Douche, Lerchenbaum: in base Almaigne, Lorkenboom.

The Rosen of this tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Resina laricea,
and Resina larigna: in Shoppes, Terebinthina, not without error, also in
Douche it is called, Termenthijn, or Terbenthijn, that is to say, Terebinthin,
or Turpentyn, and this is the common Turpentyn that we have, which should
rather be called Larche Rosen, or Larche Turpentyne.

The spongie excressence which is found in the Larche tree, is called in
Greek (...): in Latin, Agaricum: in Shoppes, Agaricus: of some, Medicina
familiae: in English, Agarik: in French, Agaric.

The Nature.
The Larche tree, his leaves, fruit, bark, and kernel, are of temperature
almost like to the Pine and Fur trees, but not althing so virtuous, neither
yet so strong.

The Rosen of this tree is hoate and dry like the other Rosens, but it does
mundifie and cleanse better then the rest.

Agarick is hoate in the first degree, and dry in the second.

The Virtues.


lib. de medicamentis secundum genera.













weak and feeble stomach, it cures the wamblinges of the stomach, and the
sower belching out of the same, causing good digestion.

Agarick is a good medicine against old fevers, for to purge the body, and
against worms: it is also very profitably put into medicines, that are given
against poison or venom.

The Danger.
Agarick is of slow operation, and taken into great a quantity, it feebleth
the inwardes parts.

The Remedy.
Agarick is corrected, to be given either with Ginger, Sal geme, but chiefly
with Oximell.

Of Turpentyne tree. Chap. xciij.
The Description.
THE Turpentine tree in some places is but short and base: and in some places
it waxes great and high, as Theophrastus writes. It has long leaves
consisting of many other leaves like to Baye leaves, growing one against an
other along by one stem. The flowers be small and reddish growing together
like grapes, afterward there come small round beries at the first green, but
afterward reddish, and when they be ripe, they be black, clammie, or fat, and
of a pleasant savor. The roots be long and grow deep in the ground, the
timber is fair, black and thick.

Out of this tree issues the right Turpentine, the which is fair and clear,
thicker, then the liquid Rosen, which is gathered from the bark, of the Fur
tree.

The Place.
The Turpentine grows plentifully in Syria, especially about Damascus, where
as it waxes very great: it is also found in Greece, and in some places of
Italy and Languedocke.

Terebinthus.


The Time.
The Turpentine tree flowreth in the spring time, and is ripe about the end of
summer, even with the grapes.

The Names.
This tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin Terebinthus: in English,
Turpentine tree: in French, Terebinthe: in base Almaigne, Terebinthijn boom:
and of the Arabian Physicians, Albotin.

The fruit is called of Auicen, Granum viride.

The gum of Rosen is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Resina Terebinthina:
of Auicen Gluten albotin: unknown in ye shops of this country.

The Nature.
The leaves and bark of the Turpentine tree are hoate and dry in the second
degree (especially being well dried) they be also astringent.

The fruit is hoate and dry in the third degree.

The Rosen or this Turpentine, is hoate in the second degree, but not ouermuche
drying: also it is clensing.

The Virtues.












Of Lentiske / or Masticke tree. Chap. xciiij.
The Description.
THE Lentiske tree in some places is of a reasonable bigness and stature, like
to a tree of a mean sise: and in some places it puts forth diverse springs
or shutes from the root like as the Hasel: the leaves which remain always
green, are like to the leaves of the Turpentine and Ash tree, many growing
together along one stem, but smaller then Turpentine leaves, of a dark
green color and thick. The bark is tough and plyant. The fruit is round,
and grows in clusters like the fruit of Turpentine.

Out of the Lentiske tree comes forth the noble and excellent gum or Rosen
called Masticke; the which is not liquid, neither growing together as the
Lentiscus.
other Rosens: but remains asunder in diverse small graynes or parts, of the
quantity of wheat corns, whereof the best Masticke is brought from the I Will
Chio, it is fair, clear, white, britle, and of a sweet savor.

The Place.
The Lentiske tree grows abundantly in the I Will of Chios, whereas it is very
well husbanded and trimmed, for the Masticke which comes from it: it is
found also in Italy, and certain other Regions, but it yields very little or
no Masticke at all.

The Names.
This tree is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Lentiscus: in English, the
Lentiske, or Masticke tree: in French, Lentisque, and Mastix: in Douche,
Mastixboom.

The gum or Rosen is called in Greek (...): in Latin, Resina Lentiscina,
and Mastiche: in shoppes, Mastix.

The Nature.
The leaves and bark of the Lentiske tree are of a mean or temperate heat,
and are dry in the second degree, and somewhat astringent: and of the same
temperature is the Masticke or gum.

The Virtues.
