JAMES, By the grace of God, king of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
TO ALL and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deanes and their
Officals, Parsons, Vicars, Curates, and to all Spiritual persons. And also t^
all Justices of Peace, Mayors, Sheriffs, Bailiffes, Constables, Churchwardens,
and Head-boroughes, And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughes, and Towns
coporate, And to all other our Officers, Ministers, and Subjects whatsoever
they be, as well within Liberties as without, to whom these presents shall come,
greeting.
WHEREAS We are credibly given to understand, as well by the humble
Supplication and Petition of our poor distressed Subjects Amy Lynsteed Widow,
the late wife of William Lynsteed, and Ioane the wife of Robert Morse, both of
Shadwell in the Parish of Stepney, in the County of Middlesex Marrinors: As
also by a Certificate under the hands of our true and loyal Subjects, Robert
Salmon now Ma^^er of the Trinity House of Deptford Strand in our County of
Kent, and others the Wardens and Assistants of the said House, being also
subscribed by the Churchwardens and other the Inhabitants of Stepney aforesaid:
That the said William Lynsteed went Masters Mate in the good Ship called the
Prudence of London, whereof John Chester was then Master, in his unfortunate
Voyage into the Straights, wherein the said William Lynsteed aduenturing his
whole estate of the value of Four hundred pounds and upwards, was with the
said Ship and all the Company in her in January, 1621. spoiled and burnt by
those miscreant Sea robbers the Turks, whereby our said poor Subject Amy
Lynsteed did not only loose her Husbands life, but also all their means which
her said Husband had with him in the said Ship: And that the said Robert Morse
being Boatswaine of the good Ship called the Anne of North Yarmouth, whereof
Abraham Wheeler was then Master and bound on a Voyage for Lisbone, was about
the month of February, 1622. taken in the said Ship by those cruel Infidels
the Turks, whereby the said Robert Morse was not only deprived of all his
estate that he then adventured with him in that Ship, amounting to the sum of
Two hundred pounds and upwards, but also of his liberty being carried to
Argier, where he is deteyned a Captive in great slavery and misery amongst
those inhumane Creatures; from which place of Bondage the said Robert Morse
cannot be released without the payment of (...)at sum for his Ransom, which
his poor wife having a great charge of small Children is no ways able to
procute, so that the poor Captine having already endured intolerable misery
under those unmercifull Pagans, is likely there to end his woeful days and to
leave his Wife and small Child for to the wide world, and that the said poor
Widow Amy Lynsteed is utterly impouerished and disabled to relieve her self
and her charge of small Children, which her said deceased Husband left upon her
hands, so that they are all exposed to extreme want and much sorrow, unless
some charitable course be forthwith taken for their reliefs herein, whose most
lamentable and dejected e^tate is much to be pittyed. And therefore we have
thought good to commend the same to the charitable comsideration of all our
loving and well disposed Subjects, as well within our foresaid County of
Middlesex, as in certain other Counties and places hereafter mentioned, not
doubting but that all good Christians well weighing the premises, will be ready
and willing as feeling members one of another miseries, to extend their
liberal and cheerful contributions toward the relief and comfort of poor
distressed Christians in this their great necessity.

KNOW ye therefore, that of Our especial Grace and Princely compassion, We
have given and granted, and by these our Letters Patents do give and grant
unto our said poor Subjects Amy Linsteed, and Ioane Morse, and to their Deputy
and Deputies, the bearer or bearers hereof, full power, License and Authority,
to ask, gather, receive and take the Alms and charitable benevolence of all
our loving Subjects whatsoever, Inhabiting within our City of London, with the
Suburbs and Liberties thereof, and in our Counties of Middlesex, Hertford, and
Essex. And in all Towns corporate, Privileged places, Parishes, Villages, and
in all other places whatsoever within our said Counties, and not else where,
for and toward the recovery of the said Losses, the redeeming of the said
Robert Morse from the Turks, and the relief and maintenance of themselves and
Children.

WHEREFORE We will and command you and every of you, the High Constable of
every Hundred within any of our foresaid Counties, that at such time and times
as the said Amy Lynsteed, and Ioane Morse, or their Deputy or Deputies, the
bearer or bearers hereof, shall come and repair unto you or any of you, with
these our Letters Patents under our great Seal of England, that forthwith
upon sight thereof, you receive the Briefes of these our Letters Patents, and
deliver them or cause them to be delivered to the Minister or one of the
Churchwardens of every Parish within your several Hundreds, to be published by
the said Minister of every such Parish the next Sabbath day after the receipt
thereof if with conueniency if may be done, otherwise the next Sabbath day
following, without further delay, And you the said Parsons, Vicars, and Curats,
for the better stirring up or a charitable devotion, deliberately to publish
and declare the Tenor of these our Letters Patents or the Brief thereof, in
your Parish Church unto all our loving Subjects within the time before
prefixed, and that when no other Collection shall be made for any other person
at all. Exhorting and persuading them to extend their liberal contributions in
so good and charitable a deed. And you the Churchwardens of every Parish where
such Collections are to be made (as aforesaid) shall immediately after the
publishing of these our Letters Patents or the Brief thereof, carefully
Collect and gather from seat to seat the charitable benevolence of all our
loving Subjects, as well Strangers as others, And what shall be by you so
gathered, to be by the Minister and your selves endorsed on the backside of the
Brief, under your hands in words at length and not in figures, and the sum
or sums of money so gathered and endorsed together with the Briefes, you the
Churchwardens or petty Constable of every Parish within our foresaid Counties,
as well in every City and Town corporate as else where, shall returns unto the
next High Constable within one week after the collection. And you the High
Constables, to deliver all and every the said monyes and Briefes unto our said
poor Subjects Amy Lynsteed, and Ioane Morse, and to their Deputy or Deputies,
the bearer or bearer hereof, when as thereunto you shall be required. And
lastly, whereas we are enforined of the great abuse which is now crept in
amongst these poor peole, who sell their Licenses unto some other person,
whereby men's charity goes not the right way, but unto such as deferne it
least, That from henceforth our will and pleasure is, that if it may appear
unto you, or any of you that the said Amy Lynsteed, and Ioane Morse, have
contracted any bargain, or made, or shall make sale of these our Letters
Patents, whereby benefit shall pass from them to any other person, That
thereupon these our Letters Patents shall be void and of none effect. Any
Statute, Law, Ordinance, or Provision heretofore made to the contrary in any
wise notwithstanding.

In witness whereof, We have caused these our Letters to be made Patents for
the space of one whole year, next after the date hereof to endure.

Witness our self at Westminster the Fifth day or February, in the one and
Twentieth year of our Reign of England, France, And Ireland. And of Scotland
the Seven and Fiftieth. STEWARD.
