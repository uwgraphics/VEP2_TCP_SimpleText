AN UNIQUE POETICAL BROADSIDE celebrating Queen Elizabeth's visit to Rye
(Sussex) in August, 1573. We have, after exhaustive research, failed to trace
another copy of this leaflet; there is no mention of it in any work of
reference or library catalogue. This broadside is all the more interesting
since scarcely anything is known about the visit it commemorates. The latest
historian of the town writes as follows: "We wish we knew more of the details
of her visit, but tradition tells us that she drank of the water of Queenswell;
some say she and her train had an alfresco meal there and came through the
Postern Gate, where she was met by the Mayor and Jurats, who escorted her into
the town and gave her a royal welcome. The date of her arrival would seem to be
11th August, 1573." (Vidler: A New History of Rye, p. 63.)

This broadside was probably printed in London and sold in the streets of Rye
immediately before the Queen's arrival.

The first anointed Queen I am:
Within this town which ever came.
A saying of each good Subject of Rye.
O Happy town, O happy Rye:
that once in thee ye Queen dothly
Such joy before was never seen
In Rye as now to lodge the Queen.
You fissher men of Rye rejoice:
To see your Queen and hear her voice.
Now clap your hands rejoice and sing:
which never erst lodged Queen ne king.
Rejoice thou town and port of Rye:
To see thy souerains Meiestie.
What heart has he that dwelles in Rye:
That joys not now as well as I?
Oh God that give life and breath:
Preserve our Queen Elizabeth.
Viuat Nestorios Elizabetha dies.
