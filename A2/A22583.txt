A Proclamation forbidding any resort to His Majesty's Court, for cure of the
Kings-Euill, until Easter next.
HIs Majesty having in September last declared his Royal pleasure touching
the time he had designed for cure of such His Subjects as were afflicted with
the disease called the Kings-Euill, which by his Proclamation, He had
prescribed to have done at the feast of the bertho four Lord God now next
coming: And although his Majesty in His gracious disposition is as ready, and
willing, as any of his predecessors at all times to relieve the distresses,
and necessties of His Subjects: Yet now having taken into His Royal
consideration, the present general dispersion and ouerspreading of the
Smallpox throughout all parts of this Kingdom, and of the danger that may
ensue to His Majesty's person, and household, by the access, and confluence
of those people to His Court for cure; Is therefore pleased to put off that
work to a further time: And both therefore hereby straightly charge, and
command, that no person, or persons whatsoever, who has the disease of the
Kings-Euill, do presume to repair to His Majesty's Court, for help, until
the feast of Easter next, upon pain of His Majesty's high displeasure, His
Majesty's said late Proclamation, or any signification of his pleasure thereby,
to the contrary hereof notwithstanding. And to the end that all his loving
Subjects may the better take knowledge of this His royal command, His pleasure
is, that this His Proclamation be forthwith published and affixed, in fit and
open places, in every Market-Towne of this His Realm.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the fourteenth day of December, in the tenth
year of Our Reign.
