A Proclamation for the Prices of Victuals within the Verge of the Court.
WHereas We understand by the Records of Our Counting House, that Our most
Noble Progenitors and Predecessors, Kings and Queens of this Realm, have
always had an especial care to restrain the excessive Rates and Prices of
Uictuals, Horse-meate, and Lodging; And that, notwithstanding the extraordinary
care thereof, taken by Our most dear and Royal Father, King JAMES of blessed
memory, yet there were within the Uerge of the Court, always some, who out of
their greedy desire of unlawful gain, would never be kept within any bounds
of equal and reasonable Prices, but, by the access of the Court, and the
increase of the concourse of people thither, would take an occasion to enhaunce
their Rates, and exact unconscionable extreme Prices, at their own wills and
pleasures:

We, taking the same into Our Princely consideration, and being desirous that
all Our loving Subjects in general, should in all places of their travail be
well used, and especially within the Uerge of Our Court, where Our Nobility,
Servants and Train, daily attending upon Our Person, are lodged and placed by
Our Harbingers, and other Suitors have daily occasion to resort, Have given
order to the Clerk of the Market of Our Household, within the Uerge of Our
Court, forthwith to cause a Rate and Ualuation to be set by indifferent
Jurors, of all Corn, Uictuals, Lodgings, Horse-meate, and other necessaries of
that kind, according to the reasonable and equal Rates and Prices of the
Market, and to renew such Rates and Ualuations from time to time, as occasion
shall require, by Oath and Presentiments of Jurors; And have commanded, that
Schedules of the Inquisitions and Presentiments of the Iuries, to be thereupon
taken, shall, not only be certified by Our said Clerk of the Market, or his
Deputy, into Our Counting House, to remain there with the Officers of Our
Household; But shall also be fixed, and set upon the Gates of Our Court, and
other places within the Uerge, as well within Liberties as without, whereby
public notice may be taken of the same; Our will and pleasure being, and We
do by this Our Proclamation straightly charge and command, That no Baker, Brewer,
Inholder, Butcher, or other Uictualler, or any other person or persons, of what
estate or degree soever he or they be, do in any wise demand, ask, or
receive more for Corn, Uictuals, Horsemeate, Lodging, or any other thing to
be specified in the said Schedule or Inquisition, then according to the Rates
and Prices therein mentioned, upon pain of imprisonment, and such further
punishment, as by the Laws of this Realm, or by Our Prerogative Royal, may
be inflicted upon them, as opressors of the Commonwealth, and contemners of
this Our Royal Commandment.

And moreover, We do straightly charge and command, That no manner of person or
persons, now using, or which shall hereafter use, to serve any City, Borough,
Town, or other place, in, or near the place of Our residence or abode, or
elsewhere within the Uerge of Our Court, either within Liberties or without,
of, or with any kind of Corn or Uictuals, or other necessaries, either upon
the Market days, or at any other time, shall be any thing the more remiss, or
slack, for making of provision for the same, then they or any of them
heretofore have been, nor shall use any color of craft, to deceive the buyers
of, or in the said provisions, or to withdraw, conceal, hide, or lay aside
their Corn, Uictuals, Horsemeate, or other necessaries, to lessen or diminish
the Market, whereby Our Train, or attendants of Our Court, within any City,
Borough, or Town within the Uerge, or the Inhabitants of the same, or any
other Our loving Subjects thereunto resorting, shall not be as well, and as
plenteously furnished in every respect, as the Markets were before, in
defrauding of this Our Ordinance.

And furthermore, We straightly charge, and expressly command, as well all Our
Officers of Our Greenecloth, and Our Clerk of the Market, and his Deputy or
Deputies, as also all Majors, Bayliffes, Sheriffs, Constables, and all other
Our Officers and Ministers of all and every the Cities, Boroughs, Towns,
Hundreds, and other places within the Uerge of Our Court, as well within
Liberties as without, That they and every of them from time to time, when, and
as often as any complaint shall be made unto them by any party or parties,
justly grieved or wronged, contrary to the tenor of this Our Proclamation,
within their authorities respectively, forthwith to endeavor themselves to see
speedy reformation thereof and due punishment of the person or persons that
shall offend therein, according to the seuerest Justice of Our Laws in that
behalf.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the fourteenth day of May, in the first
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save the King.
