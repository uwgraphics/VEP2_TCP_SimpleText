A Proclamation directing how Prisoners shall be ordered which are taken at
Sea, by men of War.
FOrasmuch as during the Hostility between Us, and the Kings of France and
Spain, diverse of their Subjects have been taken at Sea, and brought into this
Kingdom, as Prisoners, by private men of War, and there suffered to pass up
and down freely, whereby they have opportunity to observe all passages of
those things which happen here, to confer with Our ill affected Subjects,
and to corrupt them, and to view the situation and condition of the Ports and
places of this Land, fittest for Invasion, whereby great prejudice may grow to
Us, and to Our State, if it shall not be prevented.

We therefore, by the advice of Our Privy Counsel, do hereby declare Our
Royal pleasure and command, that all such persons as tither already are, or
any time hereafter shall be brought into this Kingdom by any private man of
War, as Prisoners, shall be kept in Prison and safe custody, at the charge
of those who shall so bring them in, until they shall hence be delivered, and
sent back unto their several Countries, either by way of Exchange for Our
Subjects, which shall happen to be Prisoners there, or otherwise. And hereof
every one whom it does or may concern, are to take notice, and duly to
observe the same, as they tender Our heavy displeasure, and will answer their
neglect thereof, at their uttermost perils.

Given at Our Court at Portesmouth, the three and twentieth day of July, in the
fourth year of Our Reign, of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXVIII.
