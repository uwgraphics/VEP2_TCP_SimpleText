A Prophetic LAMPOON, Made Anno 1659.
By his Grace George Duke of Buckingham: Relating to what would happen to the
GOVERNMENT under KING CHARLES II.

To the Tune Which no body can deny.

WHen Plate was at Pawn, and the Fob at an ebb,
And the Spider might weave in our Stomachs its webb,
Our Stomachs as empty as Brain,
Then CHARLES without Acre, made a Vow to his Maker,
If e're he saw England again:
I Will have a Religion, all of mine own,
Whether Papist, or Protestant, shall not be known,
But if it prove troublesome, I will have none.
I Will have a fine Parliament, always to friend,
Shall fit me with Treasure, as fast as I spend,
And if they will not, they shall have an end.
I Will have as good Bishops as e're made with hands,
With Consciences flexible to my Commands,
And if they will not, I Will have all their Lands.
I Will have a fine Chancellor shall bear all the sway,
But if they do murmr, I Will take him away,
Yet bring him back again as soon as I may.
I Will have a Privy Council shall always sit still,
I Will have a fine Juncto shall do what they will,
I Will have two fine Secretary's piss through a Quill.
I Will have a Privy Purse without controwle,
Shall always wink when my Revenue is stole,
If any be questioned, I Will answer the whole.
I Will have a New London, instead of the Old,
With wide Streets, and uniform to my own Mold,
And if they build too fast, I Will soon make them hold.
I Will have a fine Son, in making tho marred,
Shall Reign, if not over my Kingdoms, over my Guard,
And shall Successor be, if not to me, to Gerrard.
But what'ere it cost me, I Will have a fine Whore,
As Bold as Alice Pierce, as Fine as Jane Shore,
And when I am weary of her, I Will have more.
My Pimp I Will make my Minister Primeir,
My Baud shall Ambassadors send far and near,
My Wench shall dispose of my Conge Deleir.
I Will have a fine Pond, with a pretty Decoy,
Where the Ducks and the Drakes, shall their Freedom enjoy,
And in their own Language, quack Vive le Roy.
FINIS.
