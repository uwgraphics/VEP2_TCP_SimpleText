Of the Eclipses this Year, 1674.
THere will happen five Eclipses this Year, viz. three of the (...) and two of
the Moon, but all of them invisible to us, except one.

The first, is an Eclipse of the Moon, which happens upon Monday, the 12 of
June, about 5 aclock in the morning.

Hence at Edinburgh* H. M. S. The beginning of the Eclipse is at 15 13 36 The
greatest Obscuration is 16 45 49 The end of the Eclipse is 18 18 8

This w^ll be an visible Lunar Eclipse to the inhabitants of Sya^^, Germany
France, Holand, Denmark, Great Britain and Ireland etc.

The second is an Eclipse of the Sun, the 26 of January about 9 a clock at
night. And therefore it will be invisible to us, yet it may be seen in Ame^i ^.

The third is an Eclipse of the Moon, the 7 day of July about 8 aclock at nigh,
so that the Moon rises Eclipsed* and though the beginning will not, yet the
latter end will be visible if clouds, etc. interpose not

The fourth is an Eclipse of the Sun, the 23 day of Jul, about 2 aclock in the
morning. And the fifth and last is another Eclipse of the Sun, about 5 in the
morning; But because these last Solar Eclipses are invisible to the inhabitans
of Great Britt^^^ therefore I forbear to speak any more of them.

A Brief description of the four Quarters, Seasons of this Year, 1674.
Of the Spring.
THe Spring Quarter begins at the entrance the Sun into the Equinoxial sign
Aries, whi^ is upon the 10 of March 20 min. past 4 in the morning, making the
days and nights equal in length.

Of Summer.
SUmmer Quarter takes its beginning when the Sun enters the Tropical sign
Cancer, which is upon the ^^ day of June, 4 min. past 7. in the morning when
the days are at the longest.

Of Harvest.
Autumn or Harvest Quarter, takes its beginning when the Sun enters the
Equinoctial sign Libra, which happens the 12 of September, 27. min. past 10.
at night, the day and night being equal in length.

Of Winter.
VVinter Quarter takes its beginning when the Sun enters the Tropical sign
Capricorn, which upon the 11 of December, 30. min past 10 in the morning, the
days at that time being at the shortest, and the nights at the longest.

Concerning the Lord of this Year and Quarters.
AT the desire of certain Persons I have set down here the Lord of the Year, or
of this Annual revolution, with the Lords of the Quarters, by erecting figures,
for the entrance of the Sun into the four Cardinal signs Aries Cancer Libra,
Capricorn; and to the time of the Lunatious preceding and succeeding the Sun^
entrance into the same signs, which done, I find Jupiter Lord of the Spring,
with Saturn partner. Secondly (...) Lord of the Summer, and partner Jupiter.
^ly, for Autumn, Saturn, and partner Luna, (...) or the Winter, Saturn, Lord
and partner Mars, ^nence for the Lord of the Year, I find Sun (...) ^h his two
partners Mercurius and Mars. (...) ^erve, When Saturn is Lord of the year, and
(...) dignified, the people shall during that yea^ (...) revolution, build and
erect houses, shall make many alterations in Fabrics, shall abound in all
things, the Earth shall be fruitful, and the people ^^al be in esteem, and
honored by their neighbors. And the Husbandmen shall exceedingly increase their
store and wealth, and be succesful in all their labors. But if he be watery and
afflicted, there shall be much cold, great and grievous infirmities, and men
shall sustain much sorrow losses and crosses; and great damnage by storms and
rain, and wind (but this must warrily be considered, if other significators of
weather concur, thou may assuredly ^onclude it to be so) ancients and old men,
and wo^en shall die, and these things shall chiefly happen, (...) these places,
Cities and Regions, under Saturn his ^ominion, and the dominion of the sign
which be does ^ossess. Secondly as he is accordingly placed in the 12 ^oules
(as in this revolution in the second) and if held (...) the fortunat Aspects of
the Lord of the second, (...) denots the succesful and prosperous condition of
(...) common people in their ^rads and merchandising (...) they shall thrive and
grow richt especially in such things as are signified by the sign wherein the
cu^p of the second is. If he be therein weak, imp^^^^^d, (...) unfor^unat, he
shall signify contrairy, and that the people shall be poor, have losses and
crosses, especially in such things as are singified by Saturn, and ^^e sign
wherein he is, for according to the nature (...) the sign and planet therein
must you give judge^^nt
