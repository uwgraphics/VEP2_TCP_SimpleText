Jane by the grace of God Queen of England, France and Ireland, defendor of
the faith, and of the Church of England, and also of Irelande under Christ in
earth the supreme head. To al our most loving, faithful, and obedient
subjects, and to every of them greting. Where our most dear cousin Edward the
vi. late King of England, France and Irelande, defendour of the faith, and in
earth the supreme head under Christ of the Church of England and Irelande, by
his letters patentes signed with his own hand, and sealed with his great seal
of England, bearing date the xxi. day of June, in the vii. year of his reign,
in the presence of the most part of his nobles, his counsailours* Judges, and
diverse others grave, and sage personages for the profit and surety of the
whole realm thereto assenting, and subscribing their names to the same, has by
the same his Lettres Patentes recited, that forasmuch as the Imperial croune
of this realm, by an Act made in the xxxv. year of the reign of the late
King of worthy memory King Henry the viii. our progenitour, and great uncle,
was for lack of issue of his body lawfully begotten, and for lack of issue
of the body of our said late cousin King Edward the vi. by the same act
limited, and appointed to remain to the Lady Marie, by the name of the lady
Marie his eldest Daughter, and to the Heirs of her body lawfully begotten,
and for default of such issue, the remainder thereof to the Lady Elizabeth, by
the name of the Lady Elizabeth his second Daughter, and to the heirs of her
body lawefully begotten, with such conditions, as should be limited, and
appointed by the said late King of worthy memory, King Henry theight our
progenitour, and great uncle by his letters patentes under his great Seal, or
by his last will in writing signed with his hand. And forasmuch as the said
limitation of Thimperial croune of this realm, being limited (as is
aforesaied) to the said Lady Marie, and Lady Elizabeth being illegitimate,
and not lawfully begotten, for that that the marriage had between the said
late King, King Henry theight our progenitour, and great uncle, and the Lady
Katherine mother to the said Lady Marie, and also the marriage had between the
said late king, King Henry theight our progenitor and great uncle, and the
lady Anne mother to the said lady Elizabeth, were clearly, and lawfully
undone by sentences of deuorces, according to the word of God, and the
Ecclesiastical laws: And which said several deuorcements have been
severally ratified, and confirmed by authority of parliament, and especially
in the xxviii. year of the reign of King Henry theight our said progenitor,
and great uncle, remaining in force, strength, and effect, whereby as well the
said Lady Marie, as also the said Lady Elizabeth, to all ententes, and
purposes, are, and been clearly disabled, to ask, claim, or challenge the
said Imperial croune, or any other of the honors, castelles, manours,
Lordshippes, lands, tenements, or other hereditaments, as heir, or heirs to
our said late cousin king Edward the vi. or as heir, or heirs to any other
person, or persons whosoever, as well for the cause before rehearsed, as also for
that that the said Lady Marie, and Lady Elizabeth were unto our said late
cousin but of the half blood, and therefore by the ancient laws* statutes, and
customs of this realm be not inheritable unto our said late Cousin, although
they had been borne in lawefull Matrimony, as in deed they were not, as by
the said sentences of deuorce, and the said statute of the xxviii. year of
the reign of King Henry the eight our said progenitor and great Uncle,
plainly appears.

And forasmuch also as it is to be thought, or at the least, much to be
doubted, that if the said lady Marie, or lady Elizabeth should hereafter
have, and enjoy the said Imperial croune of this realm and should then happen
to marry with any Stranger borne out of this realm, that then the same
Stranger having the gouernmente and the Imperial crown in his hands, would
adhere and practice, not only to bring this noble free realm, into the
tirannie and servitude of the Bishop of Rome, but also to have the laws and
customs of his or their own native country or countries to be practiced, and
put in ure within this realm, rather then the laws, statutes, and customs
here of long time used, whereupon the title of inheritance of all and singular
the subjects of this realm do depend, to the peril of conscience, and the
utter subversion of the common weal of this realm whereupon our said late
dear cousin weighing and considering with himself, what ways and means were
most convenient to be had for the stay of the said succession in the said
Imperial croune, if it should please God to call our said late cousin out of
this transitory life, having no issue of his body, and calling to his
remembrance that we and the Lady Katherine, and the Lady Mary our sisters,
being the daughters of the lady Fraunces our natural mother, and then and yet
wife to our natural and most loving father Henry Duke of Suffolk, and the
lady Margaret, daughter of the lady Elianour then deceassed sister to the said
lady Fraunces, and the late wife of our cousin Henry Earl of Comberland, were
very nigh of his graces blood, of the part of his fathers side our said
progenitour and great uncle, and being naturally borne here within the realm,
and for the very good opinion our said late cousin had of our, and our said
sisters and cousin Margarets good education, did therefore upon good
deliberation and advise herein had and taken, by his said Letters Patents
declare, order, assign, limit, and appoinct, that if it should fortune
himself our said late cousin king Edward the sixth to decease, having no issue
of his body lawfully begotten, that then the said Imperial croune of England
and Ireland, and the confines of the same, and his title to the croune of the
realm of France, and all and singular honors, castles, prerogatives,
privileges, preheminences, aucthorities, jurisdictions, dominions,
possessions, and hereditaments to our said late cousin King Edward the sixth, or
to the said Imperial croune belonging, or in any wise appertaining, should for
lack of such issue of his body remain, come, and be unto the eldest son of
the body of the said lady Fraunces lawfully begotten, being borne into the
world in his life time, and to the heirs males of the body of the same eldest
son lawfully begotten, and so from son to son, as he should be of
auncienty in birth, of the body of the said lady Fraunces lawfully begotten,
being borne into the world in our said late cosins life time, and to the heirs
males of the body of every such son lawfully begotten: and for default of
such son borne into the world in his life time, of the body of the said lady
Fraunces lawfully begotten, and for lack of heirs males of every such son
lawfully begotten, that then the said Imperial croune, and all and singular
other the premises should remain, come, and be to us, by the name of the lady
Jane, eldest daughter of the said lady Fraunces, and to the heirs males of our
body lawfully begotten, and for lack of such heir male of our body lawfully
begotten, that then the said Imperial croune, and all other the premises
should remain, come, and be to the said lady Katherine our said second sister,
and to the heirs males of the body of the said lady Katherine lawfully
begotten, with diverse other remainders, as by the same letters patents more
plainly and at large it may and does appear. Since the making of which
letters patents, that is to say, on Thursday, which was the vi. day of this
instant month of July, it has pleased God to call to his infinite mercy our
said most dear and entirely beloved cousin Edward the vi. whose soul God
pardon, and forasmuch as he is now deceased, having no heirs of his body
begotten, and that also there remains at this present time no heirs lawfully
begotten of the body of our said progenitor, and great uncle king Henry
theight, and forasmuch also as the said lady Fraunces our said mother, had no
issue male begotten of her body, and borne into the world, in the life time of
our cousin King Edward the sixth, so as the said Imperial croune, and other
the premises to the belonging, or in any wise appertayning, now be, and
remain to us in our actual, and royal (...), by auctority of the said
letters patents: we do therefore by these present^ signify unto all our most
loving, faithful, and obedient subjects, that like as we for our part shall,
by Gods (...) show our self a most gracious, and benign Souuereine Queen,
and Lady to all our good Subjects in all their just, and lawful suits, and
causes, and to the uttermost of our power shall (...) and maintain Gods most
holy word, christian policy, and the good laws, customs, and (...) these our
realms and dominions: So we mistrust not, but they, and every of them will
again for all their parts, at all times, and in all cases show themselves unto
us their natural liege Queen, (...), most faithful, loving, and obedient
subjects, according to their bounden duties, and (...) whereby they shall
please God, and do the thing that shall tend to their own preservation, and
sureties: Willing, and commanding all men of all estates, degrees, and
conditions, to see our peace, and accord kept, and to be obedient to our
Laws, as they tender our favor, and will answer for the contrary, at their
extreme perils. In witness whereof, we have caused these our letters to be
made patents. Witness our self at our Tower of London, the tenth day of
Iulie, in the first year of our reign.

God save the Queen.
