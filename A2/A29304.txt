Some ADDITION to a former PAPER, Entitled, A Short Declaration of the Purpose
and Decree of the Everlasting Counsel of God's Heavenly Host, etc.
OH thou Offspring of God! Who can set forth the glory of thy Conception,
Birth, and Being, and the Womb that bears thee, and brings thee forth, and the
Breast that gives thee suck, and those Paps from whence thy nourishment comes?
Thou noble Seed, and Plant, and Babe of everlasting bliss; my soul delights in
the glorious beauty of thy exceeding comeliness, in every part of thy Body;
which art joined to so glorious a Head, which gives thee thy Being in himself,
who is over all Principalities and Powers; the Triumph over Death, Hell, and
the Graves sitting on the Throne of exceeding Dominion and Authority over all.

The almighty Power, which is the beginning of the Creation of God, is the
first of thy Conception; the Father of all Mercies, from the bosom of his
eternal Love and Counsel does this Seed issue forth; which is of perfect purity
and clearness, and uniteth not with any thing of that which defiles: For, that
which defiles, rises out of that part which stands in the transgression,
and in that Nature and Being, which is not of God, but of the Devil, the Father
of lies, and all false conceptions, which stand in the time of the fall from
God, the seed of the Serpent, which was brought forth since the Creation, in
the disobedience. But thou, noble Seed of the everlasting God, who were before
Creation was, or had a being in this Earth; whose goings forth have been
manifested in time, though thou had thy Being in God before all time; who
were, and art the Fathers delight, because it was from his own loins, and
bosom of his eternal Love.

Quest. How does God manifest this noble Seed in Man?

Answ. God who is Light, does shine forth by his Son, who is the Light of
himself, in the hearts and consciences of men, which are in darkness, and
covered with the shadow of death; which death came upon all men for the
disobedience sake; and the Light is manifested, to show unto men, that they are
so in death and darkness, and separated from God, who is Light; that they lie
under his wrath, and are in anguish, woe, and misery, without any hope of
recovery, as from themselves, or any power under Heaven. And therefore this
Light is God's Witness, set in Man, to reprove, judge, and condemn, smite, and
check that which disobeys and sins against it; and brings the sorrow and
anguish upon the sinner, as a reward for his iniquity.

And herein is the free Love of God manifested unto the world, that he has
sent his only begotten Son into the World; who is the Light of the world, that
whosoever believes in him, who is Light in them, should not perish, nor abide
in darkness, but shall have the Light of Life.

Therefore the way to know this noble Seed, and how God does manifest it in
man, is to know, and believe in the Light, that shines in the dark hearts of
the sons of men; and as thou come to hearken to its reproof, and believe in
that which shows thee the secrets of thy deceitful heart: It will manifest its
self in its power, to discover unto thee, that thou art not ruled by it, but by
the power of the Devil, and the lustful deceits of thy own corrupt heart, while
thou stand in the unbelief and disobedience to the Light; and by the power
of the Light of the Son of God, thou will see and be sensible of the strength
and power of sin and corruption; and as the Light does arise in thee, thou
believing of it, wilt see unbelief, and sin to be exceeding sinful; and sin
appearing in its nature and kind. And this is the first operation of the Light,
after the mind is turned to it, and convinced by it, to let thee see thy state
and condition; that thou art without God and Christ in the world; which nothing
can discover but the Light, nor make thee sensible of, but the power of the
same; which is the measure of this noble Seed, which God has sown: And Light
is sown to the Righteous; and this will bring thee, thou following it, (which
convinces of sin and unrighteousness) to receive and love the Light; and so in
his Light to see Light, and to bring all thy deeds to the Light, and to hate
thy evil deeds, and to love the Light that does make them manifest; and so thy
heart being made manifest unto thee, and thy sins set as in order before thee,
and the Light rising up in thee in its power, judgment, and condemnation, then
thou will come to abhor thy self for all thy abominations; and this will make
thee cry out, What shall I do to be saved? And to say, O miserable man that I
am who shall deliver me from this body of sin and death? And there will be a
hope begotten in thee, to make thee, in thy self, to wait to know the Savior
and Redeemer, that comes out of Sion, and turns away ungodliness from Jacob.
And so thou waiting in the Light, which does work such an effect as is before
mentioned; then thou will feel striving in thee, Jacob and Esau, the elder and
the younger; but the elder is to serve the younger, Jacob the pure plant, and
Seed of the Promise, the everlasting Covenant of God, the Seed of the Woman,
which is to break the Serpents head. And the ruff seed Esau, the seed of the
Serpent, the seed of God's Curse; these will war one against another; but the
seed of the Covenant, and of the Promise, is pure, clean, and just, single, and
upright, and wars in righteousness; for it is of the righteous God, and
therefore wars against the subtle seed of the Serpent; the cunning hunter,
shister, deceitful, unclean, profane, wild, airy, flashy, empty, and is void of
the knowledge of God; which the pure noble Seed of the Woman, the seed of the
Covenant of Life, cannot have unity with, nor own any of its ways, or wild
workings; but discovers him, in all his strong holds of sin and iniquity, which
rebels against the righteous Law of God, who is the only Lord and Lawgiver:
And that is the cause of the righteous war of the Lord God in man; to bring
these strong holds of sin and iniquity under his righteous Seed; and that, that
will not that he shall reign, must be slain before him, by his righteous sword
with two edges: And blessed of the Lord God for ever, are all such that are
entered into this war, and that stand faithful in this battle; warring with the
armor of God; which are the several branches or weapons of the seed of Light
and Life, which are mighty through God, to the casting down of strong holds,
and brings every thought into obedience to the Light; and this is through
believing, which purifies the heart; and that is the Faith, which if it be but
as a grain of mustard seed, victory over mountains of sin will be witnessed,
and a hope will be begotten, and patience, and experience of the working of its
power; and this will be as the Anchor of the soul, sure and steadfast, against
all the storms and tempests, that may arise to drive the soul to shipwreck from
its God, which is its only strength: and so the glory of the Seed of
everlasting bliss comes to be known, to increase in its battles, and wars,
against all the fruits of the evil and cursed seed of the Serpent; and Christ's
Ensign comes to be lift up, and his Standard comes to be gathered unto, and his
valiant displaying of his Banner is known with triumph, in the victory of so
glorious a Captain of Salvation, which saves and redeems out of that vile
servitude, by which they were kept in by the Devils power, which carried them
captive at his will, unto every sin and noysom lust. Oh therefore, all, come to
the Light in each particular Conscience, which is the pure gift of God; that by
it you may see and discern the enemy of God, and of your souls deliverance out
of that captivity, by which he would still keep in bondage the soul, and the
righteous Seed of the Lord God: but in the Light wait, and watch to see him in
all his wiles and ways of working, to keep this Light in obscurity, and the
virtue of it under, that the glory of it might not be known. But, my dear
friends, believing in the Light; and owning the sufficiency of it, Oh it will
raise out of all obscurity, and it will shine, and discover all the darkness,
and all the ways and works thereof; and it will arise in strength, and whet its
glittering Sword of power, to cut down all that stands in the way of it; and he
will be known to be as a fire, to burn up all those briars and thorns, chasfe
and stubble; for the Light of Israel is as a fire, and his Holy One as a flame,
to burn and consume all that stand in the way of it, and nothing is to strong
for it; and though the sins and iniquities, be as pricking briars and thorns,
as chasfe and stubble, and all gathered as thick combustible matter, to wound,
prick, choke and smother, to darken, cloud, vail and cover this noble Seed and
Offspring of Light, by its own power it will arise out of it all, and make it
all manifest to their utter destruction, as there is a waiting in it; and so
that appearance being felt and believed in, the further manifestation of it
will arise; and so it will be known, not only to discover the darkness and
deeds thereof, and the opposition the Prince of darkness makes against the
Light, but set up his judging and condemning power, and his full strength to
cut off and destroy the Devil, and all that stands in the way of his setting up
of his Kingdom of Righteousness, and Peace in the hearts of men: And therefore
does he appear to sit as a refiner of silver, and as with fullers soap, to
purify and cleanse the hearts and consciences of all those that believe in
him, who is the Light of the world; which in the fallen state, and the
unbelieving state, are defiled by sin and rebellion against the Lord: in which
state all men are in, let their Profession be what it will, till they come to
believe in the Light, the Seed of the everlasting Covenant, freely given unto
man, for him to be guided by it alone; which whosoever comes to believe in,
they receive the power and virtue of it, and so are acquainted with its
operation, and the nobleness of its strength, life, dominion and authority;
which gives victory over the power of darkness: but this glorious victory of
the Lamb's power, who is the Covenant of Light, Truth, and Seed which serves
the Lord, none can understand nor witness, while they stand in the disobedience
to the Light, which shines in the darkness, which comprehends it not.
Therefore, if men would understand the manifestation of this noble Seed, which
is the glory of the whole Creation of God; for from that holy Womb where it
rests, and from whence it came, was the pure Creation brought forth, which was
before corruption was; and therefore all the whole Creation must be subject
unto it, and its pure power, and must believe in the least appearance of it
now, in its restoration of all things, as they were in the beginning.
Therefore there is an absolute necessity of believing in the measure of Light,
manifested from God in the heart and conscience: though they be dark and
covered with the shadow of death, this Light does shine upon them that sit in
darkness, and in the shadow of death: And it is for this end, that they upon,
and in whom it shines, may turn to the Light, that by it they may be turned
from the darkness and death, and so might not abide in death and darkness, but
might receive the light of Life, and so come to be acquainted with its power
and virtue; that in the Light and Life, they may walk, abide, and dwell; and so
no more to be of the night of thick darkness, but of the pure sunshine of the
clear day; by which they come to be known to be the children of the day,
redeemed by him who is Light; unto him all power is given both in heaven and in
earth, to redeem from the dark state, which the whole world lie in; that do
not, nor will not believe in the Light of Christ in their hearts, freely given
from the Father of Lights, which is their condemnation, which in its day and
time has shined upon them; but they still rejecting of it, this Light comes to
be put out, as to them, though never can be, as in it self, but it shines
always bright and clear; and to such in whom it is put out, it will be known,
to be a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God, who is a
consuming fire, and everlasting burnings, to all that wilfully disobey, and
reject the Light which shined in them; which is a manifestation of the glorious
Gospel of the blessed God, whose sound is gone forth over all the earth, and
his word unto the end of the world: And if this Gospel be hid, it is hid to
them that are lost; and such are they that hate the Light, and will not believe
in it: And the god of this world has blinded the minds of them that reject and
slight so great Salvation, as this is which has been so freely preached, and
declared of, and witnessed unto, by many of the dear Servants and Children of
the living God, in this our day and age in which we live. Oh that men
therefore, before this day be past, would consider and return to the measure of
Light in them, before it be put out, and believe in it; and then they shall
know that it is not natural, but spiritual, and of a spiritual nature,
property, and quality, and of the nature of God, who is Light; of which, all
that believe in it, are made partakers of his divine Nature: and it is able to
teach them all things, that pertain to Life and godliness; and to reveal the
great mystery of godliness, God manifest in flesh; and the glory of God in the
face of Jesus Christ: And that is the first Principle of the Oracle of God,
which leads unto repentance from dead works, to serve the living and true
God, that made Heaven and Earth the Sea and all things therein: and so come to
know the Word by which al things were made, by which we live, move, and have
our being, even by him who is Light, which is the beginning of the Creation of
God, both old and new: And so his power comes to be witnessed, and magnified
over all, and his glory does arise over all the works of his hands; the noble
and royal Seed, and offspring of the infinite God, being witnessed to be
raised up by his power, and that glorifies him from whence it comes; and so
coming to know this measure of Light, which is the free gift of God in man, and
minding of it, it will bring to wait in the silence, to know his voice, which
calls to be cool, calm, quiet and still: for it stills the raging waves of
those tumulting thoughts, and imaginations, and consultings of the carnal
reasoning, of that part which stands in the transgression, and would have
audience, so as to prevail over the charming of the wise charmer: Now the Light
gives the knowledge of that part, and the ground from whence it springs, the
nature of the corrupt tree, and plant which God never planted, and seed which
he never sowed, but is of the Devil the cunning Serpent; and this is needful
for every one to know the nature of these two seeds; be you wise or foolish
according to the wisdom of this world, which must be brought to naught; be you
poor or rich, bond or free, male or female. Now the way to come to a perfect
knowledge of the two Seeds, which are one contrary to the other, as light is to
darkness, and death to life, and good to evil; you must know that in your
selves which is as a weight and burden upon your hearts and minds; and you
minding of it, you will know it to be God's call and knock in man, that he may
be heard, and his voice known, that so his counsel may be understood, and the
operation of his hand may be felt, and his divine power reserved to work out
all that which is contrary to him; and that wrought and established in them,
which is of himself, that he may be known to dwell and abide, and walk in them
by his Seed, that thereby they may do his will, and be subject to his power,
that so his power may be magnified over all. Now the cause why the way, word
and voice, of the Lord God is not known, nor the workings of his divine power
witnessed in men, is, because they mind not to turn into that which secretly
knocks and calls at the door of their hearts, but turn aside from it, though
many times the weight may be so heavy upon them, that they know not how to bear
it; and the reason of that is, the loving of their evil deeds, and their hating
and slighting of the Light which does reprove them; and so, as much as in them
lies, run away from that which would do them good, into the evil, as into
jollity and some outward vain thing; or into the multitude of outward affairs
of the world; that so by the reason of the noise of that, they may not hear the
sound of the pure voice of the Lord God in the wilderness, that would make
straight the way of the Lord, for his ransomed to pass through, and to come out
of Egypt's Land of darkness, to walk in the light of the living, on which their
eternal welfare depends, both here, and for ever hereafter: And the rejecting,
and not hearing of the knock, voice, and call of the Light of the Son of God,
which stands at the door of their hearts, and knocks, that he might have
entrance in, and be received by them into their hearts; I say, the rejecting of
his knock, drowns many in perdition, and is the cause why they wallow in their
blood, even in their sin and iniquity, and become enemies to God, and his pure
way in which all his dear servants walk in; which is the Light of the Lord God,
and by it they know his knocks and calls, checks and reproofs, condemnation,
salvation, and justification unto life. O that men would hear, fear, dread and
repent, and not slight so great salvation, and not trample under foot the blood
of the everlasting Covenant of Light and Life, nor count it as an unholy thing;
but that they would turn to the calls, and knocks of the Lord God; and that
they would understand what he says, Behold, I stand at the door and knock; and
every one that hears, and obeys, and receives him in, he does come and sup with
them, and they come to be made partakers of his banquets, and of the wine and
milk that he has mingled, and prepared for them, in his own house: which house
of God, none can know, nor the Laws, nor Ordinances thereof, that knows not his
voice, knock, and call; and that does reject it, and will not obey it; when
they come but in the least measure to know it; as some may know it by its often
following of them, with Plagues and Judgments, for their disobedience; and to
bring them into obedience to the measure of Light made manifest in their
Consciences; And therefore all that have desires in you, to know the Lord, and
would walk in his pure way and path, and would find the rest which God has
prepared for the wearied souls; and that would be delivered from your sins and
lusts, which war against your souls, and from the Devils power, which is not
only your enemy, but the enemy of God, and of your eternal peace, and
everlasting happiness: And therefore I lay it upon all such, and desire that it
may lie as a weight upon you always, and that you may bear it continually; to
wait to know in the secrets of your hearts, the pure calls and knocks of the
Lord there, and turn in your minds to it, to know what it speaks; and be it
known unto such, it speaks judgment and condemnation to the sinner, and
reproof, and always calls to turn from sin, and from the vanities of the world,
which lies in wickedness, and to turn to the Lord; that so from him they may
find mercy, and plentious redemption; and to feel after his Son, who is Life,
and the quickening spirit; without which, no man can know redemption from sin,
nor reconciliation with God, and so, not peace with him; Nor none can worship
the Lord in truth, but as they witness a measure of the Resurrection of the
Just; and the Just is not witnessed, but by that Power that kills the sin, and
slays the transgression; and then that is known, which passes through the death
and darkness, and overcomes him, which has the power of death, (that is the
Devil) which is the Life of Jesus Christ, the Son and Word of God; which Life
of Jesus does arise, in the destroying of the death, and overcoming of him who
is the Power and King of death; then Life is known to rule in man, by the power
of him that raised Jesus from the grave; and this quickens the mortal body, and
then Life rules, and it treads down sin and Satan's power under the royal feet
of his divine Power and Authority, who is God blessed for ever: Oh therefore
wait and watch, to know that which is the weight of God's Power, that it may
arise over that which lies as a burden upon the Just Principle of God, and
that that may be removed, and that which is as a weight and burden of and from
the Lord, that it may be known and believed in; and that is it that will take
off the weight of sin that presses down the soul: And so waiting in the
watchfulness, sense of feeling will more and more be witnessed, and of
discerning, to know the one from the other; by which discerning as it
increases in you, you will come to know the movings of the pure power of God,
and the weight of his Law of Commands, that you may be obedient unto them, that
in so doing, you may come to eat the good of the Land; and also you will come
to know the working of the deceitful part, and the imaginary part, which is not
of God, and it will work in a Mystery: but as thou feel that which is pure
in thee, thou will also feel a love raised up in thee to it, which rises from
its nature, and growth; then thou will watch unto that which is pure, that it
may stay thy mind, and then thou will know a guide unto thy mind; which thou
must know infallibly in thy self; and this is a stay to fix upon, which is
sure, steadfast, certain, and infallibly true; which is the measure of the gift
of God, the Light, Life and Seed of his eternal Spirit of holiness: And this
being known and witnessed in thee, then thou will know a sure, certain,
retiring place, to retire unto in all times of need, and this in thee; and
herein will thou know the Standard of the Lord set up in thy heart, and it is
to be sled unto, when the enemy does assault thee, and comes in like a flood
upon thee, as he may do, to seek to drown thee, and to drive thee from this
sure refuge; But this is the strong Tower, which is the Name of the Lord, it
being fled unto, and this everlasting Rock being built upon, the gates of Hell
and Death cannot prevail against it. And herein comes the glorious Renown, of
the royal Seed and Offspring of God, to be witnessed, which gives and gets the
victory over all sin, and brings in everlasting righteousness: And as all stand
in the Light, the righteous Power they will witness, and feel stirring in them,
which will beget a true hungring after the everlasting righteousness of God,
and that by it alone they may be covered, and so will wait and watch to have it
more and more revealed in them, and so to receive it into their hearts; and
then nothing more desirable unto such, then to be covered with the same; and
the power of it will so inflame your heart with love to it, because of the
nature of it, which will burn up, not only your unrighteousness, but your
righteousness also, and so you will come to be acquainted with that which
abides for ever and evermore; the Life of the Son of God, which will make free
from the Law of sin and death; and then, sin shall not have Dominion over them
which walk not after the flesh but after the spirit; no, nor their
righteousness they will not glory in at all; for now they are not under the
Law, but under the free Grace of God, which believe in the glorious Light of
the glorious Gospel of the blessed God; and this comes to be multiplied in and
upon their hearts, and the manyfolds of it comes to be known, and read within;
and herein they come to be established, and settled, and grounded, in the
eternal Truth, as it is Jesus, though they may meet with many oppositions in
the travel of its workings; for many and great will be the trials and
temptations, in their passing forth of Egypts Land of darkness, and out of the
shadow of death, woe, sorrow, and perplexity; before they come to the Land of
Canaan, the Land of Rest, and Peace, and Quietness, and Assurance for ever: yet
in all the trials and tribulations they meet with, in passing out of darkness,
to walk in the Light, believing in it, and minding of it, the Power of the Lord
God of Heaven and Earth, which is the Light; will be with them that receive the
Light, the Witness of God placed in them, to be their Leader and Guide, by his
Pillar of Fire by night, when it is dark upon them, to show them the way that
they should go; or by his Cloud by day, as it will seem a Cloud to them, but
light to him who is Light to guide them; for they may go too fast, and be too
hasty, therefore he will stop them, that they may be subject to him, both in
their journying and standing still; they that can receive it, let them, that
know what I say, that so all may be acquainted with the motion of God in all
particulars, that they may not only have the Light (which all have, though
they be not guided by it) which is the true guide and way to God, and
everlasting rest; but that they may know it assuredly, by the true and
infallible testimony of it self in them, by the daily exercise of it; and so
the strength they daily feel to be renewed upon them in their hearts; and so
they will come to know the Life of it, to be an everlasting refuge to sly unto,
in all times of need, trials, and temptations; and so they come to grow in the
strength of the Almighty God, who has begot them by his Word and Power, and
begun a good work in them by his Light, which has turned them from the
darkness, they believing in it, by which he will perfect it unto the end, and
will carry it on to his glory for ever; and then they shall know evidently that
he has wrought a change in them, and has made and is making their hearts
pliable to his holy will and pleasure, and has performed and is a performing
his free promise in them, in making them to be willing in this the day of his
power, manifest in them in the beauty of holiness, and so holiness becomes a
delight unto them; as formerly they took delight and pleasure in sin and
iniquity, they now abbhor it, and as they took pleasure in unrighteousness, now
they delight to do righteously, and love God's own righteousness, and to walk
humbly with the God of their salvation; and so they wait upon him, to feel his
pure power to break their hearts, and melt them in his presence, that they may
always witness soft hearts, tender, broken and contrite; and so they feel his
Love, which is their Life, shed abroad in their hearts; and this, they minding
of it; will keep them always in a suitable frame, to do and suffer the will of
God, and to stand and abide in his counsel: And who ever thou art that art come
so far, let thy trials be what they will, and though they may come thick upon
thee, as a dark cloud, and as a mighty Storm and Tempest, and as an overflowing
Sea, and Flood, thou feeling thy mind retired in the innocent state, inward, to
feel the Power that opens thy heart, and thou feeling the springs of. Life
stirring in thee, and bubling forth into every part, with its refreshing virtue
of the noble and righteous Seed of eternal Life, to rise up in thee; therein is
thy refuge, and stay, and safe harbor, and then thou art safe, as in the Arms
of God; and this is the Law which the Isles are to wait for, and the Arm on
which they are to trust; and that is his eternal and everlasting Power, to be
renewed upon them day by day, and his Love and Life raised in them; and this
preserves above and a top of the storms and tempests, and the thick cloud will
scatter; and the clearness of the Son of Righteousness does arise above all
obscurity in them, to the great and exceeding refreshing and comfort of their
hearts, with the Lamb's Power, which gives the victory, and the dominion over
all the many tribulations; and so they come to be acquainted with that in which
their preservation stands, which is the refuge of all the faithful servants of
the living God, which are acquainted with his exceeding strength to stand by
them in all times of need, yea in sharp temptations, and sore trials, and many
tribulations, that does and will assault them, both within and without, on the
right hand and on the left: He that can understand, may read me; A word to the
Wise is sufficient. But it is, that their Faith, Hope, and Patience may be
tried, and that they may grow in the Experience: For, Tribulation works
Patience, and Patience Experience, and Experience Hope, and Hope makes not
ashamed, in the Day of the Lord, which they wait and hope for; which will bring
them forth as gold; and that they may have knowledge of the same, not only to
have that which stands by them in a time of need, which all men have less or
more, though they know it not, but them that stand fast in the time of trial,
to have the certain knowledge by the experiment of the workings of his divine
power, that their Faith and Hope may stand in God, and not in the best of the
sons of men: And therefore it must be tried by the contrary opposition, yea and
by something like it self; and the Almighty Jehovah knows his own work, which
he has wrought in every part thereof, from the beginning of it, and how he
does and will carry it on; but this Stone is a tried stone, sure and precious,
therefore he will have every one that are built thereupon, come to the
knowledge of it in themselves, that so they may stand in the strength of it, in
the measure received from God, that they may stand faithful, not only to have
Faith, but to have the knowledge of it by the trial of it; that they may know
the increase of it, and to be full of Faith and of the knowledge of his pure
Spirit, that so they may walk in the Spirit; and then, there will not be a
fulfilling the lusts of the flesh; but a mortifying the deeds of the flesh, by
the Spirit; and so the Spirit of God is the leader; And as many as are led by
the Spirit of God, they are the Sons of God: And if Sons, then Heirs; and
Joynt-Heirs with Christ, the everlasting Seed, and Covenant of God, in, and
with man.

And so they know their Heir-ship, by the Spirit of the Son in them, by which
they call God Father; and so they come daily to receive the Gift of the Father,
which is Eternal Life, manifested in the Son Christ in them, which is the Hope
of Glory.

And hereby they come to the knowledge of the Lamb's Power, and Seed of God's
renown; the blessed Root and Offspring of David, the bright and morning Star,
the Glory of the Saints and faithful Children of the Most High God of Heaven
and Earth; which is the Power that every knee must bow unto, and every tongue
confess, to the glory of God the Father of all mercies, who from the bosom of
his own Love has manifested this so great a kindness, and his wonderful power,
which does translate from the Kingdom of Satan, into the Kingdom of his dear
Son, the Light of the world, and Seed of the everlasting Covenant of Life; In
him are all the Promises, Yea, and Amen.

Much more might be said concerning the Royalty, Power and Authority, Dominion
and Victory of the Renowned Seed and Noble Offspring of the Lord God Almighty;
but it may be summoned up in this, The Eternal Arm of the Lord God's Power is
manifested, to destroy Sin, and Satan's Power in man, and to bring man into
obedience of the pure Power of the Lord God again, by which he was created, and
from which he fell; the Word which made all things, that is near, in the heart
and mouth; which searches the heart, and tryes the reins, and divides between
the precious and the vile, and cuts off the vile, and preserves the precious,
that it may serve him for ever in the Beauty of his own Holiness; without which
no man shall see the Lord, who is Light and Life for ever and evermore.

He that will understand what is before mentioned, must read within, with the
Light in the Conscience which must give the knowledge of it: for from the
experience of the working of the Light, Life and Power of God, are these few
lines given forth; not to satisfy the comprehending part of that, which may
for a time be satisfied with the truth of words, but there is that which cannot
be satisfied with the clearest demonstration of the purest words, that may be
uttered forth by the mouths of the best of the sons of men; which are uttered
forth for this end, to direct the mind, where, and upon what to wait, and to
stir up that which is pure in man, that he may come to be satisfied with the
Life it self, which the Word sounds forth from the Life and from the living
Power; so that, that which has been dead, may live by it again: The Soul which
is immortal, no mortal thing can satisfy, but the immortal Word and living
Power of God, that alone can satisfy the hungry soul, which is satisfied with
the Righteousness of God, and with nothing else; and to that alone I desire to
be known, and that will read me in the heart, where the Light does operate and
bring into obedience to the same: for which end is this, and all that comes
from the same Spirit in the several demonstrations and manifestations of it
unto the sons of men, to bring all into the Light, and to obey it, that in the
life and power thereof they may live, to the praise and glory of his Grace,
that Life may be magnified over all; and so I have my end.

A few Words more to Friends which are in the Truth, to stand fast therein unto
the end, that they may feel the Crown and Dominion of the Lambs Power, now in
this great Day of Trial.
Which is as follows.
SO all my dear Friends, stand fast in the Truth which you have believed in and
received, for it is a day of trial, and a time of great temptation; wherein the
enemy is exceeding subtle, and crafty, and wars in a mystery, even the Mystery
of iniquity; to drive from the hidden wisdom of God, the mystery of the
powerful workings of Christ, in the secret, hidden, and inward man of the
heart, renewed by the working of his mighty power. But, Oh God! thy Throne
endures for ever, and the scepter of thy Kingdom is an everlasting Scepter of
living righteousness; And thy foundation is from everlasting; and this
foundation Stone thou have laid in Sion, thy beloved City; and that which is
built thereupon, is of its own nature, and has its being and standing in that
which was before the foundation of the Earth was laid; the unmovable power of
the Lord God, which was before any thing was, unto which the changable,
visible, dissolvable, moveable power must be subject: Yea, thy own whole
Creation, which thou made, which is good, as thou made it, and man in it
upright; and thou made it all to be subject to thee, and to stand in thy
counsel, and to subject to thy holy will; but the subtle Serpent wrought in
subtilty, to betray the innocent being, which God had made, he being ignorant
of that foundation which was in the very secrets of God's heart, and which he
had prepared in his own secret counsel, for man's restoration back again into
a more sure standing, than upon any righteousness of man's own; and that man
might be built upon the foundation that stands sure, and that upon it might
stand firm; never to be removed from it by all the subtilty and sleights of the
enemy, nor by none of all the storms, and tempest, and violent floods, and
waves of foming Seas that he may raise, and may be very ready to go over the
Souls: But the Decree being set, Hither must thou go, and no further; here must
thy proud waves be stayed: And therefore now being come to that, which was hid
in God before the world was; the great mystery of God revealed in us, which is
Christ, the great power of God, in whom we were chosen before the foundation of
the world was laid, and we are come to that which shall abide for ever; when
all things are dissolved, which have done their work, that was to last the time
appointed: And when all those spirits that would draw and rend from this sure
foundation, Christ, the light and everlasting rock; those spirits shall weary
themselves for very vanity, and shall eat the fruit of their own ways, which
will be indignation and wrath; and shall be serapated from the presence of the
God of our Life, and we in him shall have the victory in the Lamb's power, and
authority over all the subtle temptations of the wicked one; and we shall sit
in the habitation of Peace and Rest, above all the habitations of Cruelty, and
over all deceitful workings of guileful Men, in the Dominion that our Captain
has purchased for us, which answers the will of his Father, which gave him a
ransom for many; that our Assurance may stand, as it does upon a more sure
Foundation, and better Promises, than that of the Law of Works; that so we
might not be shaken, nor moved in our minds, nor hearts, by any slights of the
Devil, nor Men, which lie in wait to deceive; They being ignorant of God's
righteousness, and of his great love toward us that believe, and hope in his
mercy for ever: And in that love, life, and power of his everlasting
righteousness, we can see through all the thick darkness of this world; and
over all the confused commotions, and stirs of the many Waters, which are
People, Nations, and Languages of Babylon, the Mystery of Iniquity: And that
which does see through all these, is the immortal Seed, the power of the
infinite God, the Light and Spirit of Truth, which gives the victory over them
all: Therefore know it more and more, that so in it you may stand, and be bold,
and valiant, you spiritual Warriors of, and in the Lamb's power; and that
meddle not with the lower powers of the darkness of this world, which lie in
wickedness, and so act with carnal weapons, the will of the Devil, which acts
in wicked men, their wicked ends to accomplish; in which stands their strength
and outward force, of the weapons of war which are carnal; but our weapons are
spiritual and not carnal, which do over come the strongest force of all outward
strength of Men and Devils: For they war with the arm of flesh, against Christ
the great power of God; we standing fast in the Truth, shall see the Spirit of
the Lord will blast them all, with his Spirit of patience and long-suffering;
which is the Lambs power, which gives the Faith and Victory over all, through
the operation of Christ, which is, as I said, the great power, wisdom and
righteousness of God the Father of all things, who is ordained a Light and a
Lamp for ever, to light the Israel of God, into that state, where there will be
no need of the Sun nor Moon, for the Lord God and the Lamb will be their Light
for ever and evermore, Amen.

1. HE that in the Life and love does stand,
Shall surely know Christ's just command;
And movings of his divine power,
Guiding his actions every hour.
2. That Rule alone does guide aright,
And show the darkness from the light;
It lights him the assured way
That leads him to the perfect day.
3. To know the Sun that shines so bright and clear,
And makes all misty fogs and shadows disappear;
That Light and Life be known, the Standard of the Lord,
Which does to all his own, comfort and strength afford.
4. This is the hand that leads to the most heavenly rest,
By which alone all that are led, for ever sure are blessed.
The Light which is the Love, that from the Life does spring,
Shows us the lovely virtue and fruit of every thing;
That eye which only can discern and clearly see,
The God and Guide of man to all etenity.
5. Which Life and Love so freely does from him for ever flow,
His Wisdom and his Righteousness he unto men does show
In them, that so his glory might unto its height arise,
That they may love to magnify his Name in any wise,
Who is the author of all good unto the sons of men,
And from his bosom has his love most freely showed to them.
6. The Son of everlasting bliss,
In whom perpetual rest there is,
Through th'everlasting Covenant,
Made good to all the penitant,
7. Who forsake sin, which God desies,
(And periods all their miseries;)
Is Christ the Light, by whom we gain
Redemption from eternal pain.
THE END.
