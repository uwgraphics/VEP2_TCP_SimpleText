Deep calls unto Deep; OR, A Visitation from on High UNTO The Breathing Seed
OF JACOB,

Which is not satisfied among all the Professions in the Earth, or with the
Husks cannot fill its belly, but is pincht with hunger, and feels a secret Cry
for the true Bread that comes down from Heaven which gives Eternal Life.

Wherein is opened some of the mysteries of God's Kingdom to the clear
understanding of the Poor in Spirit to whom it belongs, but to others it is
Parables.

Concerning GOD, what he is, and where he is, and of his Worship; And of the
First Day, and the Seventh, or Sabbath day; Also showing plainly in what day
God is rightly and truly Worshipped, and the difference and Character of the
true Worshippers and false clearly described.

And concerning Christ, what he was before the Law, and in the time of the Law
to this present time, and what and where he is now; Also something concerning
the Word, and the Gospel, and the Scriptures; and of the Body of Christ, and
Resurrection and Ascension, and of his Coming and Reign, and of the Kingdoms of
this World becoming his Kingdoms, etc.

Which may give much satisfaction to the upright inquiring mind, being given
forth in the true love and compassions of my breathing soul, that so the simple
might be turned to hear the voice of Wisdom (which cries in their streets) and
forsake the foolish and live.

By William Bailey.

The dayspring from on high has visited us; to give light to them that sit in
darkness, etc.

Luke 1.78, 79. London, Printed in the year, 1663.

A Visitation from on high, etc.
Of the fall and, and Restoration, etc.
IF man (who was made upright, after Gods own Image) had never sinned or
transgressed against him; there had been no need of sacrifice and offerings for
sin, or of a Savior from it. If man had never fell from the Knowledge of God,
and lost unity and peace with him, through disobedience against his word of
command, and so become degenerate there had been no need of a restoration,
reconciliation, or of salvation; If man had never gone into darkness, out of
the right way of blessedness and everlasting happiness, there had been no need
of preaching or declaring the way (which is the light) to lead him out of
darkeness into the way of peace and unity with God again; If there had not been
a departure from the invisible God, who is a Spirit of Truth and Righteousness,
then had been no need to say to the Sons of men, Return, why will ye dye; If
death were not the end of that path which leads from God, the invisible
Fountain of life: If man had never been in bondage and captivity to sin (and
Satan the author of it,) there had not been need to have mentioned or declared
of redemption and freedom from it, etc.

But seeing (as the Scripture says) all have sinned and fell short from the
Glory of God, and death has passed upon all men, and darkness has covered the
earth, and gross darkness the people, and a vail have been over the face of all
nations, and blindness has happened to Israel, so that the Ox and the Ass
has more knowledge of their owner than they of the Lord their maker; and all
have gone out of the way of peace (which was the good old way before
transgression was) and the fear of God was not before their eyes as it is
written, -- and the true voice of God (the shepperd) has scarcely been
understood by dream, vision, or prophet, man has been so degenerate (by the
deep sleep of ignorance, wilfulness and perverseness) from the pure God and his
ways, that it is hard to be uttered by the tongue of men or Angels, the
invisible eye (that only sees God) have been so blinded, and the wrong eye have
been opened, in the imaginations, and in the visibles, that it has been
frequent among the children of men to call good evil, and evil good, to put
light for darkness, and darkness for light; because the God of this world has
blinded the eye; and then by the blind (both leaders and followers) he himself
is worshipped as God; even that wicked one which leads out from God, and then
exalted himself in [man] the temple of God, governing and ruling in the hearts
of the children of disobedience, and this great Whore has sat and reigned
over Nations, Kindreds and tongues, and the Kings of the earth; and this is
that Antichrist whom the Lord will consume with the Spirit of his Mouth, and
destroy by the brightness of his coming, which day is at hand.

But now seeing (as I said) it is and has been thus, as before mentioned, all
have been concluded under sin, and in the bondage of corruption, darkness and
ignorance, where the mysteries of God and Godliness have been hid, and the way
of peace not known, being departed from by transgression, which is the only
ground of separation between God and man, who thereby is captivated, and become
as sold under it; so that without being awakned by the voice of the Son of God,
and made alive, and redeemed from transgression, and reconciled to God again,
man will utterly perish from Gods comfortable refreshing presence, and be for
ever driven into darkness, where they shall never see light, but to their
perpetual torment and anguish this will be the portion of them who knows not
God, nor desires the knowledge of his ways; therefore there is a necessity of
a Restorer, a Redeemer and Savior, for them who are sencible of this their
fallen, captivated, and miserable state; for while man is in this state, he
neither knows God, nor his worship; but this inscription is written upon all
their Altars (their prayers, sacrifices, and worships; [to the unknown God.]
for no man knovves the things of God but by the Spirit of God, (though they may
imagine and talk about them, in their darkened minds,) and none have received
the Spirit of God (as to know his doctrine and worship,) but they who turns,
and have turned at its reproof, (which is in the inwards parts) which reproofs
are because of transgression, that it may be turned from, which is the only
ground and cause of the separation from God, and of the Ignorance of his will,
ways and worship, which is in the spirit, and in the truth; which no man can
know, or comprehend, or walk in acceptably, but by the guidance and direction
of Gods good Spirit, which is the leader of his Children and people, into all
truth and righteousness.

So now seeing there is a necessity of a Savior to help and restore, redeem
and reconcile man unto God again, and of a way to enjoy that happiness and
blessedness again which was once lost by disobedience and transgression; And
that unity and peace with God must again be witnessed, or else all the talk of
Hope, Faith, worships, or religions, are but in vain; except the Soul (which is
in [man,] invisible and Immortal) comes to enjoy the invisible eternal God
again, in a full, free, true, satisfactory endless life. Therefore it remains
that this Savior (or the way of this Salvation) be plainly made known,
described, or charactered to the understanding of the simple, that the
hungerers and thirsters after righteousness, who are weary and heavy laden, may
come unto him and be refreshed; which by the help of Gods good Spirit of grace,
(by which it is put in my heart, and brought to my remembrance) I shall
endeavor to do, to that end, and that God may be glorified, being rightly
known and worshipped; in which I have my reward from him and in him, who
works in me both to will and to do according to his good pleasure.

Now this may seem (to the wisdom in some) needless to treat of, or speak of
those things by way of information, direction or doctrine, which have been so
common and frequently declared and published in these days, in which most are
ready to say (in these Countries,) we are Christians, and believe all these
already, and these things have been daily taught in our streets, or the like;
and these are no new things to our ears, but that which we have heard of old,
or from the beginning etc.

Now mark my words, (and give good heed unto that which follows,) for they
shall stand fast (answering the witness of God in all) as a nail in a sure
place, and they shall speak as the oracle of God.

1. Concerning the Knowledge of God, His worship; and of the first day, and the
seventh or Sabbath day, etc:
FIrst as to the matter in hand, at which I at present aim, is to speak somewhat
to your understandings concerning what God is, and where he is, and what his
worship is, and where, and how he is to be worshipped, and by whom he is only
truly and acceptably worshipped; for this was the occasion of what follows; or
rather the Spirit of God in my heart, took occasion to give forth these things
unto public view, by hearing a dispute or controversy between two teachers
amongst the people called Baptists near Amersham in Buckinghamshire) whose
names (according to information by enquiry was Thomas Tillham, and Joseph
Ciech) concerning the day or time in which God was to be worshipped; one
seeming to hold for the first day of the week, and Tillham for the seventh day;
at which time I (being there by chance) had spoken something among them of
these things, if I had not been prevented by being thrown down by some of the
ruder sort amongst them, which was through the occasion of that Tho. Tillham,
who said he would not stay in the house if I was suffered to speak amongst
them; and also said, that my words came from the Spirit of the Devil, when I
began to speak in the Spirit of God. So they could do no less in obedience to
the intent of his words, but to pull me down, or hall me out of the house; for
he was much in fury, and the mark of Cain I beheld in his face; but I have the
vvitness in my self, that the bowels of Gods love in me was even yearning
toward the simple hearted amongst them, whom I savv were led in ignorance,
darkness and blindness, by their blind leaders which causes them to err more
and more from the way of the Lord, by darkning his secret counsel (in them)
with their many words without knowledge, and for their sakes did the Lord
begin to open my mouth in his fear, power, and wisdom, to speak concerning the
things that belong to their everlasting peace, of which now the Lord have
given me an opportunity to write that he may for ever be clear of all their
blood, and be justified, by them, and this they shall acknowledge was his love
and mercies unto their souls in the the day of visitation, which is at hand
hand, whether they hear or forbear.

The Character of true worship, and of false worship, and worshippers.
AND now take notice of this one thing follovving, by the way, and consider it,
and the effects of it which has been very frequently amongst the Sons of men,
in the cloudy and dark day of Apostasy from Christ and the Apostles life, which
is, of worshipping a God they know not, or without the true knowledge of him
whom they worship, etc. For in this state and spirit has lodged the very root
and ground of all errors and discord, strife and confusion, persecution and
cruelty about Religion and worship, where they have killed and destroyed one
another about it.

In this state were the Athenians, and the Shrine makers of Diana, who
persecuted the true worshippers, who knew the God whom they worshipped, and
declared him unto them, who arose up against them. Therefore beware of their
Altar and inscription [To the unknown God] whom they did ignorantly worship, as
many do now, who are in enmity against the true worshippers, who can say (to
the praise of God, as our elder brother did) we know what we worship, for
salvation is of the Jews, (and he is a Jew that is one inwardly.) So the
character of a true worshipper, is to know God first, then to worship him in
the spirit of truth, which only gives that knowledge: And the character of a
false worshipper is contrary, worshipping first, not knovving what, nor
whom they worship, which is not accepted, nor [novv] never can be; seeing
the hour is come that they only are the true and acceptable worshippers, who
worship the Father in the spirit, and in the truth; for such only he seeks
to worship him, John 4: 21, 22, 23, 2^.

To know the true and liveing God, is the great and needufl thing without
which all worship, sacrifice and religion is vain though a man or people had
all the words of Scriptures from the beginning to the end, and were in the
highest profession of Christianity in the world, yet if he do not truly know
God, he is but in darkness even until now; and he that says he knows God, or
loves God, and yet hates his brother, is a liar. Therefore to be contented to
worship an unknown God, or to worship they know not what, is very blind,
ignorant, false, and erroneous; but if thou come first to know God, then thou
art in the right way of a true worshipper, as may be mentioned more hereafter;
and seeing the right way to worship God, or to be a true worshipper, is first
to know him whom they worship, therefore it is necessary to speak next what
God is, (as I said before) and then where he is, and how he may be known,
and then what, and wherein, his only worship is, and who are the only
true acceptable worshippers; seeing there are many false and vain worships,
and worshippers, that know not God, nor his day in which he is only
worshipped.

2. Concerning God, what he is, and where he is, etc.
GOD is [Light,] this is our message which was from the beginning, and in him
is no darkness at all, this is his name, he that can hear and receive it let
him; with whom is no variableness nor shadovv of changing. He is that [ I am]
that sent Moses to deliver Jsrael, to whom he spoke in a bush, that burned,
and was not consumed, but Moses savv no similitude, only he heard a voice,
and so forbad them (by Gods command) of making to themselves any likeness or
image of any thing in Heaven or earth, to worship, (read in the Life of God,
which is invisible,) whose voice may be heard, saying, To what will ye liken
me, do not my presence fill Heaven and Earth; or what house will ye build for
me; and where is the place of my worship or rest? or the day which I have
sanctified thorovv out all generations? and this same God which spoke unto
Moses was the God of his fathers, (which were before Moses was born, or the
Law written in Tables of Stone, or the outvvard days or Ceremonies was)
even of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, not the God of the dead, but of the
living. (mark that) and the living it is, that can only praise and worship
him: he that has an ear to hear let him hear.

And this same invisible God, of which no similitude must be made, is a Spirit
of Light, Life, Truth, and righteousness in himself, holy and incorruptible,
etc: and so is his worship in the Spirit, and in the truth, which is witnessed
in the hearts of such as are quickened and made alive by his power and Spirit in
their inward parts, who can now say to the professors of this age, as our elder
brother did unto the women of Samaria (though they think themselves in a better
state) for she was then saying in her simplicity. Our fathers worshipped in
this mountain, and at Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship etc but
he answered and said, Woman, believe me the hour comes, when ye shall neither
in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the Father, ye worship ye know
not what, etc. (this is a hard saying, can the Jews and Samaritans of our age
bear it) God is a Spirit, and they that worship him must worship him in the
Spirit and in the truth. But some wise professor might say unto me, Who knows
not this? But I say, be not hasty, or wilful, but stand still and make
diligent search in thy own closet, and see whether thou art yet come to the
Spirit, and to the truth (which is but one) (and in it do worship God,) in
which only is the true worship; for he that talked with this woman that was
able to distinguish (by her knowledge) between the way of the Jews and
Samaritans, telling her all that ever she did, was the very Christ (read in the
book of thy conscience) which made her leave her water pot, as he has many of
us (who were as high in knowledge as she) when we perceived he was the
Prophet of which Moses vvrote, whom all are to hear; that ends the types and
temples made with hands at Jerusalem, and Samaria's mountain, where their
fathers worshipped, etc: but he is to be obeyed now, who said. The kingdom
of heaven is within you; who drives all his in this path, to within; in the
Spirit, and in the truth; for they only know what they worship for salvation
is of the. Jews and he is the Jevv that is one inwardly: whose heart is
circumcised to worship God in the Spirit: whose praise is of God, though
unknown, despised, or persecuted of men.

So now I say to you, who are contending and disputing about the seventh and
first day outwardly, in which of those God is to be worshipped, being divided
about days, and times, and outward worships; one party, for one day and the
other part for another day, etc. Not knowing what or which day to worship in,
like the Jews and Samaritans, for that was the parallel which came into my
heart from God, concerning you both; of which I had spoken something (as I said
before) had you been peaceable like Christians, or the Church of God, where the
first is to hold his peace, when any thing is revealed from God to him which
stands by, etc. Which was truly in me, but some of you were so rude with
noises (more like Bear-baiters then Christians) that my words should not be
heard amongst you, like them that stop their ears and gnashed their teeth
against Stephen, which especially was thorrow that Tho: Tillham, of whom I was
even ashamed and of your profession; and indeed my heart could even been broken
for you, to behold the blindness and ignorance, enmity and wilfulness that was
amongst you, which I even marvelled to hear and see, in such a (day as this) of
Gods revelation and manifestation of truth and love amongst the children of
men. But I have considered, and said in my heart, how can it be other ways
with you? then it was with Babels builders of old, in confusion, one building
up in this meaning, another throwing down in the other meaning, and
Imagination, bringing mortar for brick, and brick for mortar, not understanding
one another meaning and language; and this is just with God, seeing many of
you have denied the one pure language (which is before Babel) in which God is
worshipped in one consent; for it is his hand that always breaks and confounds
the City, and Tower which the children of men would build in their
imaginations, whose top they thought would have reached to Heaven; This is
your state, and the Lord God will scatter you and your building till there is
not one stone left upon another in all the earth; and also destroy you from
being a people, except you repent with speed, and turn to him that smites you
secretly, in your consciences, for your iniquity and hypocrisy; and this is a
word of prophecy from the Spirit of truth, which shall be fulfilled in a
season that is approaching.

And now as concerning your controversy, about the time or day in which God
is to be worshipped, I have somvvhat more to say, desiring that you would
weigh it in the balance of equity, though it might seem a cross to something
in you, yet the words of my mouth shall be right; and the Mysteries of God are
in my heart, as a great deep in this matter, which would be very large to
express in full concerning these things to the clear understanding of them
among you, which indeed cannot be rightly known but by the Keys of David, which
only opens the door of this treasury; and though it may be esteemed a low thing
in the eyes of the prudent of this world, and be despised as a day of small
things; yet in this Mountain the Lord have made unto us (his Children,) a feast
of fat things, praise and glory and everlasting thanksgiving be unto him that
sits upon the throne, and to the Lamb for ever, and ever.

Therefore now that you may understand these things, and be rightly informed,
mind first the fear and dread of the Lord, and be very still and serious, with
your hear to upright before him, that you may in very dead and truth, perfectly
come to know and enjoy the thing that belongs to your Souls everlasting peace,
and read these things without prejudice, consuming envy, which boils in the
breast of that birth which shall never inherit Gods Kingdom of Rest.

3. Of the Sabbath day.
FIrst, take notice, that the [day] in which God [Rested] was [Sanctified,] who
commanded that in it should no manner of works be done, and that they were not
to speak a vain word nor think their own thought? either kindle a fire, or bear
a burden in that [Day] which was commanded to be kept [Holy.] for indeed it is
an [Holy Day] in which God [Rests,] and in the same (In which he Rested) he
dwells for evermore; for he called the [Light] day; and the [Darkness] he called
night, and says the Scripture, God dwells in the [Light,] with whom is no
variableness or shadow of changing, and this is the first [day] in which he
began his Works; and this is the last in which he finishes which is Sanctified,
[in which he Rests,] and this is that [Holy Day] in which a man (by Gods
command) is forbid to speak a vain word, or think his own thoughts, but this is
a mystery hid from them, in whose heart the World is so set, that they know
neither the beginning nor end of the Work of God, for says Christ Jesus by
whom the World was made (the beginning of the Creation of God, the end and
substance of the types, days, figures and shaddows, who fulfill them, and the
law that gave them for their times and seasons.) I am the Alpha, and the Omega,
the beginning, and the ending, the first, and the last; who was before all
things, by whom all things were made, whose Throne and Kingdom must endure for
ever; who said [I am] the [Light] of the World, Learn of me, for [ I am] meek
and lowly in heart, and you shall find [Rest] unto your [Souls;] and this is
the substance of the outward days or Sabbaths; for the word Sabbath, is [rest.]
So that if you will be exact in the observation of the outward day, (as the
Pharisees were, (which was but a figure of the inward rest,) you must only
[rest] from all manner of Labor, or work outwardly; and yet when that is done,
it makes nothing perfect as partaining to the inward conscience: For the
Pharisees judged Christ not sent of God, because (said they) he keeps not the
Sabbath, and so in their blind zeal judge him to be a transgressor, who was the
very Substance of all those outward things, and is the only rest prepared for
Gods People, and they who have entered into it, have ceased from their own works
as God did from his, and such only knows the [Sabbath day] which is kept [Holy
unto the Lord] in which the vain words must not be spoken, nor the vain
thoughts lodge; for the tongue of the just (in this day) is as choice silver;
but the heart of the wicked (which knows neither the beginning nor the end of
the works of God) is little worth; but we who have known it, and his wonders in
the deep, (upon the face of which the Spirit of the Lord did once move) do know
right well, that the same [day] in which God began his Works, is the same in
which he compleats it, and in which he rested, when he had made all things Good
and Blessed; but this is a mystery to the natural man, or that outward birth
that sticks in the outward natural things, which cannot perceive the things of
the most inward Spiritual God, and his Kingdom which is within, in the
Invisible hiden man, which is spiritual.

So it is only the pure in heart that sees God, and knows his Sabbath, and
throne, which endures for ever; where the vain thoughts are judged and cast
out, and not suffered to lodge within, for that defiles a man, which is Gods
Temple, if the Spirit of God dwells in him, whose fire is in Zion, and his
furnace in Jerusalem. Blessed is the eye that sees.

Therefore if you would rightly know the Mysteries of God and Godliness, and of
his everlasting Kingdom of Righteousness and peace, to your Souls satisfaction,
you must enter in by the door, and not clime up another way (as many have done
in their imaginations) which door is Christ, the Light (the First day) that
Lights every man that comes into the World, that all men through him might
believe; and this is the beginning of the work of God, where it is not only
given you to believe, but also to suffer for his sake in whom you have
believed; in which state you will know the six days labor, before the true
Sabbath be witnessed, wherein God rests from his Work; for there is no rest
or peace unto the wicked, says my God therefore he that condemns the sin in
the flesh, and destroys the works of the Devil, in whose hand is the Law
(which is the Schoolmaster to bring unto him) who is the end of it for
righteousness to every one that believes must needs be the rest or Sabbath to
the soul. So his yoke being known upon you, and the daily cross taken up to the
will and ways of man, in which he has walked in his own thoughts and vain
words, and the bridle to the tongue witnessed (without which all religion is
vain) here you will know some work, standing still in awe; in which you will
learn in the lowliness of heart, and in so berness of mind, to put on the
Ornament of a meek and quiet Spirit which [in God's sight] is of great price:
and here you may know the [Sabbath day] and also the [first] in which he moved
at the beginning upon the face of the deep, [which is but one] the Alpha and
the Omega, the true and saithful witness, the beginning of the creation of God,
who is the end of all things at hand, who says [I am] the [Light] believe in
the Light, and before Abraham was [ I am] He that has an ear, let him hear
what the Spirit says.

So come ye all down to the [door] and enter in thereat (if you would know the
sheepfold, where he makes his flock to [rest] at noon which is the Light of
Christ Jesus in all your consciences; and despise not the [day] of small
things, though it be but a spark shines in a dark place, it is the sure word of
prophecy, to which if you take heed, you will do well; it is the testimony of
Jesus, which will let you see all that ever you do, if you be still, standing
in awe and God's fear in your closets, our of all reasonings and imaginations;
and this must you come unto, to know the beginning of the work of God, even the
Light, and Spirit of God, in which the Saints of old began, and in which they
walked, and said the Apostle to the Galathians, Ye did run well, who did
hinder you, etc? ye begun in the Spirit, and would you now be made perfect by
the lesh? and the Spirit is within, and the flesh is without, Mark, They began
in the Spirit, and afterward run in observations of days, and months, and
times, and parties, who were saying, J am of Paul, and J am of Apollo etc: are
ye not now carnal, and walk as men? J am afraid of you (says he) lest J have
bestowed upon you labor in vain; yet he travels again in birth with some of
them, that [Christ] may be formed [in] them, who is the end of the outward
days, months and years (the wisdom and power of God) whose years never fails,
but is the same yesterday, to day and for ever; the beginning and the ending of
the Works of God, (which is but one) whom the heart in which this world is,
(and the love of it) knows not; though be came into it, and is come into it,
and the World was made by him, and for him; and he is before all things;
blessed is the man that does witness this in his own particular, for such only
have the comfort of the Scriptures which declares of these things: Therefore
come to the Spirit of God (which reproves the world for sin) and walk in the
Spirit, that it may lead you into all truth, and show you things to come, in
which is no occasion of stumbling, or disputing about days or times; meats or
drinks, or the like, but you will see plainly of the Father, and it will take
of Christ (what he did and suffered) and show it unto you, that you shall not
need to say, Whatis this meaning? and what means the other Scripture? and the
like; but you will (being faithful) be made partakers of his sufferings
within and without, and know his death when you are made conformable unto
it, bearing in your body his dyings, that his life may be manifest in your
mortal flesh, etc.

This the Apostles and Saints did and do vvitness, who began in the Spirit and
vvalks in the Spirit, and worships God in the Spirit and in the truth; who
have no confidence in the flesh, but are Jews inwardly, whose circumcision
is not outwardly of the flesh, but inward of the heart and of the spirit,
which the other was but a type of, or a shaddovv, as was also the [Seventh]
or Sabbath [day] of the [rest] prepared for the seed and heritage of God.

So if you would rightly know and observe the day in which God is only
acceptably worshipped, you come to the Light, which is the first day, and in
which God dwells for ever, and is the last; as it is written, In thy Light shall
we see Light, for with thee is the Fountain of Life, and the secrets of the
Lord are with them that fear him, and he will show them his Covenant. Now what
can thou desire more (O man) then the Fountain of Life? and to know the
secrets, and everlasting covenant of his mercies and loving kindness, in which
is the treasures of wisdom and knowledge; which are made manifest unto them who
waits at that wisdoms gate, which was before the hills was, whose voice cried
in the streets to the simple, saying turn in hither, eat of my bread, and drink
of the wine which I have mingled, forsake the foolish and live; Therefore take
my advice in Gods Counsel, and come now to the fear of the Lord, and wait in
his [Light] which makes all things manifest, for that is the beginning of
wisdoms path, which leads unto the perfect [day] in which the most holy
unchangable everlasting God is worshipped; and out of this there is no true
knowledge of him, or his worship, or any acceptance with him; or any assurance;
stability; or satisfaction, which will endure for ever, and this is the word of
the Lord unto you all; For the hour is come that the true worshippers, (who
know what and whom they worship) do worship God in the Spirit and in the truth,
these are the true worshippers who worship the Father; this is the childrens
worship, that honors their Father and their Mother, whose days are long in the
Land of the living, even the everlasting day which sprang from on High.

So all the worship and sacrifice, without the guidance of God's good Spirit of
truth is false, and they that run, strive, and act without it are false
worshippers, let them profess (in words and show) what they will; for the
Spirit is the guide of its children, (the true worshippers) into all truth, in
which they worship their father who seeks such to worship him; And all
such as are not guided by it, do run before it, and talk of the things of God
in their dark understanding, and sensuality, out of God's covenant of Light,
and doubt of his fear, in the contentions and debates, strivings, disputings,
and vain janglings about them, and those things that shall for-ever (in that
state) be hid from their eyes. So that all people upon earth, in all their
professions of religion without the leadings of God's Spirit, are at best but
vvill-vvorshippers, like Nimrod the mighty hunter before the Lord, (and the
Lord is that Spirit) the beginning of whose kingdom is Babel, (confusion)
read your state, with God's vvitness, the Light in all your consciences,
which will answer the truth, and do not dissemble, not strive to make
coverings, which will be too narrovv? For it is even so: The very beginning
of that Kingdom, worship or building, where the (Spirit) of God is not the
guide and leader, is [Babel,] and there the mighty hunter (who is a mighty one
in the earthly comprehension) goes before the Lord [that Spirit,] which should
guide and go before them: But the day is at hand, that Nimrod and his Kingdom,
(both City and Tower, which was built in the high imaginations) must fall; and
all the untempered morter-daubers shall fall with it, and the wall shall be no
more at all nor them that daub it, the Life of God has spoken it, which is
come down to confound the Language of all the Earth, and to restrain them from
what they have imagined to do.

Therefore hear all ye people, in whose hearts are any honest desires, or true
breathings after the true and living God, and the Knowledge of his ways and
worship, come ye all to the [Light] of Christ Jesus, with! which you are
Lighted, in which (as you abide) you will come to know the [one pure Language]
in which the Righteous Pure God of Truth is [onely] worshipped, with [one]
consent, which was before [Babel] the many Languages, and before the hunters
confusion and contentions about these things was; in which you will come to
feel the path of Peace, and way of Holiness, in which a fool shall not err;
where your Immortal Souls may be satisfied as with marrow and fatness in Gods
House; where the Bread is sure, and the Water fails not; who makes Rivers in
the desert, and the dry Land springs of water, and makes the Wilderness a
fruitful field, and the barren Womb to bring forth many Children, which are as
Oliv-branches round about his Table; Glory unto him that Lives and Reigns
for Evermore in the Highest. Amen.

Therefore come out of Babylon, come out of Babylon, (confusion) says the
Lord, come away and stay not, but come into Zion, (the Holy Hill) and declare
in it the Vengeance of the Lord against her: For the Arrows are ready, and
the Bovv is bent by the arms of the Almighty, that shall sink Babylon;
therefore haste, run, and deliver every man his soul out of her; for God has
set her on fire at both ends (he that can read let him) and thou shall be
burnt, O City of confusion, the smoke of whose torment begins to ascend up,
which shall ascend for ever and ever; for strong art thou, O Lord God Almighty,
who wilt judge and avenge thy own cause, and of thy righteous seed, and the
blood of the Martyrs of Jesus upon her, and thou have said, the time is at hand
that she shall sink like a Millstone in the depth of the Sea, and rise no more at
all; therefore unto thee be the glory and praises, songs and halelujahs in the
highest for evermore, for thou art worthy.

Postscript.
ABel worshipped God in the Spirit, and in the Truth, but Cain was a false
worshipper, and knew not God; who arose up against Abel his brother, and killed
him about Worship. Enoch walked with God and was translated, he worshipped God
in the Spirit and in the truth, and God took him, and he had a witness in him
that he pleased God. Abraham obeyed God, who rejoiced to see Christ's day (the
Light) and was led out of his own Country thereby; he was a true Worshipper of
God in the Spirit, and in the Truth. These, and many more obeyed God, and
worshipped God, and knevv God and his day in which he is worshipped before
the Bible was written, which declares of these things.

Esau the first Birth, the cunning Hunter abroad, lost the Birthright and
Blessing; he was a profane person: but Jacob the plain man, the second birth,
which carried at home, was blessed.

And says the Scripture, Blessed is the man whose mind is stayed on thee, thou will keep him in perfect peace: But the foolish woman her feet abides not in
her house, but pulls it down with her own hands; being without, loud, stubborn
and clamorous: These things were written for your learning, and may be read
near, they are an Allegory; but let him that reads understand, for the time
hastens in which they shall clearly be understood to the ends of the earth.

The Second Part, etc.
Concerning Christ Jesus and his Names, etc.
AS concerning Christ Jesus, what he is, and what he was, and where he is none
knows, or can rightly or truly know, but such as have received the Spirit of
Truth, which leads into all Truth, and shows the things that are, and are to
come; which reproves the world for sin, for righteousness, and for judgment;
which is the Comforter of all them who forsake their sins, their own
righteousness, and all false judgment, and puts on his righteousness, and
righteous judgment, which exceeds that of the Scribes and Pharisees, who in all
ages did (and do) shut the Kingdom of Heaven against men, not entering
themselves, nor suffer (but persecute) them that would. And the Kingdom of
Heaven is within, etc.

1. Christ is a [Name] given to some [thing] which was before that [Name] was;
and [Jesus] is a [Name] given to the same thing; and Emanuel, and many other
[Names] are given to the [one] self-same [thing] according to the discoveries,
operations, and manifestations unto them, and in them (in several seasons) who
declared of him according as they witnessed, and knew his appearances, and
effectual workings in their inward parts; even the holy men of God, who spoke
as they were moved by the holy Spirit, which Spirit revealed the Mysteries of
Godliness unto them according to his will, and their several measures and
abilities of his gift.

2. This Christ of whom they speak, was in the world before the Law, and in the
time of the Law was that mystery hid under all the vails and types, figures and
shadows, carnal ordinances, and ceremonies; in which time he was as a seed, (or
that good part, or substance of truth, and righteousness) hid in the
consciences of the Children of Israel; which answered the outward Law written
in tables of stone. This Moses saw in his day, who received the Laws,
ordinances, statutes, judgments and ceremonies, which were to keep them in a
sense, and in a fear toward God, against whom they had transgressed; and to
keep them near the feeling of his tender seed and witness in them, that they
might not be wholly hardened against his appearance, when the time came that
[he] should be manifest to Israel, which was the end and substance of all
these outward things; Which once being rightly known and obeyed in the inward
parts, keeps the heart and conscience tender and upright, pure and undefiled in
God's sight and fear, without the precepts of men, shadows or ceremonies; for I
have seen that wisdom of God that gives the interpretation of things, and to
understand the dark sayings of old, and what was hid in all those Ceremonies in
the time of Moses's Laws; and he that makes known the Parable (I am sure) is
the end and substance of them all; in whose Light let me speak of two or three
which in simplicity has been hid from the wisdom of man, who cannot answer
them, but as that understanding is brought to naught; but let that answer in
which they are given forth, and you shall understand them with satisfaction; and
my questions are these: 1. Why did the Lord command, that when any one found a
birds nest, that the Dam was not to be taken with the Young? 2. And thou shall
not sees a Kid in his mothers milk? 3. Nor fow thy field with diverse sorts of
seeds? 4. Nor wear a garment of linen and woollen together? 5. And thou shall
not muzle the mouth of the Ox that treads out the corn, etc.


Now if thou can see with that eye which Paul saw (who was a fool for Christ)
when he said, Does God take care for Oxen? or, Speaks he not this for our
sakes? For our sakes, no doubt, etc. Then thou will answer, Does God take care
for birds nests? or the sowing of fields? or garments of linen and woollen? or
Kids, or their mothers milk? or was there not something in all this for our
sakes? Well, but however these things served to keep them in a sense of the
unknown seed, which suffered because of the hardness of heart, and corrupt will
of man, which had lost the knowledge and guidance of God's good Spirit, and
these things served for a time, even till the fullness of time came, in which
the seed came to be manifest (which was Christ) who had been hid from ages and
generations, and till the same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead comes
to dwell in people, and quicken their mortal bodies, the power of God
witnessed, and the Spirit of Truth to be the guide and leader into all truth,
and to be their Comforter, etc. But when this is fulfilled and witnessed,
there is no more need of any shadovv, figure, or ceremony to put us in
remembrance, but the Spirit of Truth being received brings all things to our
remembrance, and shows us things (past, present an) to come; which declares
plainly of the Father, and no more to us in parables, figures, or shadows.

So now, this Christ was before the World (that now is) began, and was a seed
before any Name was given to it, which in process of time (being begotten of
God) was born of a Virgin, had a Body prepared, to do the will of his Father,
(as it is at this day) but none knows him (or ever shall) Born but of a Virgin;
(he that has ears let him hear) whose eye is single, mind stayed on God,
forsakes all, takes up the daily Cross, denies Self, follows the Lamb
wheresoever he goes; loves him that had been slain more then all, more then
Father, Mother, Wife, Husband, Children, House or Lands, Yea, of his own Life;
these only knows him born, though once like Mary, said How can this be, seeing
I know not a man? (seeing I have no strength, wisdom, parts, or abilities of my
own,) but the answer is, as it was (be thou but the Virgin) the Power of the
most High shall over-shaddow thee, and that. Holy thing which shall be born of
thee, shall be called the Son of God; this was Christ's Name in the Womb, a Holy
thing (read within,) and then had other names, as Jesus, and Emanuel, and many
more before these, and many more since, and yet he is but one, and was before
them all; This is the I am which was before Abraham, whose name in the
beginning was the Word, all things were made by him and without him was not any
thing made that was made in him was Life and the light was the Light of men
etc: John 1.1, 2, 3, 4, etc.

Awake therefore now ye shepherds, who have been keeping your flock by night:
And look upwards ye earthly minded, and behold his Star in the East, the wise
men (whose eyes are in their head) have seen it, and been led by it, till the
Babe was found lying in a Manger, for in the Inn there was no room for him: He
that has an ear to hear, let him hear, and he that has an eye, let him see,
for the day is come, that what we have seen in secret must be preached upon the
House-tops. Behold a wonder, a woman does compass a man, and yet she is clothed
with the Sun, was there ever such a thing heard? but this is in Heaven, and
none knows it, or ever shall (as I said) but the Virgin who is over shaddowed
with the Power of the most High, And this is the word of the Lord God unto all
People upon Earth; Therefore if thine eye be single, thy whole body shall be
full of Light, (and God is Light,) but the double minded man is unstable in all
his ways, and the Carnal mind is enmity against God, and is not subject to
him, but the Virgin is subject to the Power of the most High, where Christ is
known to be first a holy thing, then a Child given, and a Son born, which is
Emanuel, God with us, a Savior, a wonderful Counselor, the mighty God the
Prince of Peace; with many other names, which (as I said before) is given to
this one incomprehensible being which the whole world cannot contain. But that
which may be known of God, (or Christ, which is one is manifest in people,
there he is, and is only to be found, and he that have seen him (who is the
Son,) has seen the Father also, but it is only the pure single invisible eye
that can see him, for he is a Spirit, and is known and worshipped only in the
Spirit, and in the Truth, etc.

This is that God (which Paull preached to the Athenians) that made the World
and all men of one blood that dwells upon the face of the earth, and has
appointed them bounds of their habitations, times and seasons that they all
should seek the Lord, if happily they might feel after him, and find him, who
is come near to judgment, and is the swift witness against all unrighteousness
and ungodliness of men, for he searches the heart, and tries the (...), and
shows unto man what is his thought: this is he that formed the Mountains, and
created the Winds, whom the Heaven of Heavens cannot contain; and yet dwells
with him that is of an humble and contrite Spirit, and trembles at his word,
and he (...) in his people, whose God he only is, who know him dwell in them:
And says David to the people, Let God arise, and his Enemies will be scattered
as smoke before the Wind, and this is he by whom all things was made, as it is
written, John, 1 1.

Concerning the Word, and the Scriptures.
IN the beginning was the Word and the Word, was with God, and the word was
God; all things were made by him, and without him was not any thing made that
was made; in him was life, and the lise is the Light of men, and the Light
shines in the darkness, but the Darkness comprehends it not, etc: Read this
now with understanding, and thou will see that Christ's name is called the Word
of God, as it is written in Revel. 19.13. And then if thou come to see him
the seed of the woman which bruiseth the Serpents head, thou might know the
parable of the sour, which sowed good seed in the field, in all the sorts of
ground there mentioned, (but the enemy sowed the tares in the field) and the
field is the world (when the parable is opened) and the seed is the word of
God Luke 8:11: And says David, I have hid thy word in my heart, that I might
not sin against thee, which was a Light to his feet, and as a lamp to his
path; and said the Apostle, We have a more sure word of prophecy, (then the
outvvard voice though it came from the excellent glory) which ye do well to
take heed unto as unto a Light in a dark place etc.

Now this was not the Scriptures, but of this the Scripture declares, even of
the word which was in the beginning, before the Scriptures were written,
which cannot be properly (in no sense) called the word, or word of God,
because it is many words, and declares of what God did and said, of his
Creating the World by the word, which was not created by the Scriptures, but
holy men of God spoke and writ them, as they were moved by the Holy Spirit
(which is the Word) And said Moses, God spoke all these words, Exodus.: 20: 1^
which God was the Word in the beginning that spoke the words. and the word
of the Lord came to the Prophets, at several times, and upon several
occasions, saying, Thus says the Lord, etc: So then, they spoke and writ what
they were commanded by the Word of the Lord: so that it is plain to them that
have a right understanding, that the words were given forth from the word,
which word was hid in their hearts (as David says) which was there before
the words were given forth; and Holy men of God were moved first, (by that
which is Holy) to speak and write, before they did speak or write forth the
Scriptures, which are a true declaration of those things which were done and
spoken by the word which was in the beginning; and Iet none say, that the
report is the arm of the Lord, seeing Isaiah (a true Prophet of God) did make a
true distinction between the report and the thing reported of; for says
Christ, the Scriptures are they that testify of me etc: but in him was the life
and Salvation, and not in the Scriptures, though they are an outward testimony,
and true declaration; And yet how ignorant have people been since the Apostles
days (in the Apostasy) of these things, calling the Scripture the Word of God,
when the Scriptures themselves says, Christ is the Word, and in the beginning
was the Word, and the World was made by the Word; but the Scriptures were not
in the beginning, neither was the World made by them; for they are many words
spoken at sundry times since the beginning, and so are many words which
declares of the Word, and of those things which are certainly believed among
us, Luke 1.1.

Concerning the Gospel.
AND so in the time of ignorance and darkness (which has been for ages) both
teachers and people who have been and yet are in the Apostasy from the Apostles
Life and Spirit, have frequently called the writings ( of Matthew, Mark, Luke,
and John) the Gospel, and so have called the Scriptures the Gospel, when as
the Scriptures (the true declaration) says, the Gopsel is the power of God,
and the Gospel is everlasting, and the Gospel was preached to Abraham long
before Marthew, Mark, Luke, and John were born, which Gospel is the power of
God, and Christ is called the power of God, and the wisdom of God, who said,
Abraham rejoiced to see my day, and he saw it and was glad; so Abraham knew the
[glad tidings] who was before Moses; for God says to Moses, I am the God of
thy Fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; this was before the Scriptures, this
was the power of God and the wisdom of God, by which the soul immortal comes to
be redeemed, the captive delivered, the chains of darkness death, and hell
broken, and all its enemies scattered; this is glad tidings indeed, and this is
rightly called the Gospel of salvation, of which Paul, nor we, are not ashamed;
for it is the power of God, and many have the Scriptures, and yet have not
salvation or redemption by them, but are in the error, ignorance and darkness,
not knowing the Scriptures, nor the power of God, of which the Scriptures
declares.

And in this state people have been in great contentions, and debates; striving
in their dark imaginations about these things, and can never be satisfied, nor
never shall, till they come to the Light in themselves, which only can give
them the knowledge thereof; for that is the Key of David, that opens to [them]
who do not exercise themselves in things too high for them, but are become as
weaned children; for says Solomon, wisdom is to high for a fool, and she
dwells not with consuming envy, neither will she enter into a froward heart;
for wisdom is a loving Spirit, she is the beginning of all the works of God;
and the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; unto which if a man comes
not, he shall never know Gods secrets, nor the mysteries of his kingdom, which
are hid to that part, nature, or Spirit in man, that would always be knowing
and climing up into the tree of knowledge, and would know the mysteries (but not
obey his call, and come down as Zachens did) but the Cross is to obey according
to what is already known, though it be never so little of stature; and without
this daily Cross (which crosses the hasty mind, the will and wisdom of man)
there can be no true knowledge of the Mysteries and will of God, and without it,
thou can never know true peace and satisfaction, though thou compass sea and
Land in thy comprehension, the Lord has spoken it.

Concerning the body of Christ.
AND now having mentioned something concerning Christ, and concerning the Word,
and the Scriptures, and the Gospel, etc. There is somewhat in my heart remaining
concerning the body of Christ; about which great contentions, opinions and
debates have been amongst them, whose eyes are not in their head, but at the
ends of the earth. First, I believe (and we believe) that Christ had a body,
and came and preached, and suffered, and dyed, and rose, and ascended, and
sits at Gods right hand, etc. According to the Scriptures; but yet some are
saying to us (with a lying Spirit) You deny the Resurrection, and the body of
Christ, etc. To which (for the simple-sake according to the Scriptures of
truth) I shall answer:

As for Christ, I do believe in my heart infallibly, that he had a body
prepared him to do the will of God, and that he suffered the contradictions of
sinners in the days of his flesh, and was crucified by wicked men, great
professors, chief priests, rulers, Soldiers, and elders; and was laid in the
grave, and rose again according to the Scriptures, and did ascend over all the
principalities and powers of the darkness of this world, and now sits at the
right hand of God, etc. And I do also believe, that he has yet a body which
was prepared, and is yet preparing to do Gods will, in earth as it is in
heaven, etc. But me thinks I hear some say (in their reasonings and
imaginations) What body has he? and where is it? seeing it is said, he is at
the right hand of God; this I shall answer with his own words, which he spoke
here on earth, viz. No man ascended up into heaven but he that came down from
heaven, the Son of man which is in heaven; he that has an ear to hear, let him
hear, and take notice, what body that was which come down from heaven, when
Mary said unto the Angel; How can this be, seeing I know not a man? when he
told her the Savior should be born, and that holy thing that should be born of
her, should be called the Son of God; etc. Now mark the answer, The [power] of
the most high shall overshadow thee, by which [power] the body was prepared
here on earth, and says Christ (the Savior, the wisdom of God, and the power
of God) a [body] have [thou] prepared [me] mark the distinction, [thou] [me]
and [a body] this [me] that spoke in the [body] was the [Christ] which had a
[body] prepared to do [his] will that prepared it: Now was it the [body] or an
invisible power, Spirit or Soul, that said, A [body] have [thou] prepared [me]
He that has an ear, and understanding, let him hear, and judge.

But yet here this question may rise concerning the body of Christ; is it not
written, The heavens must contain him until the restitution of all things? And
was he not taken up into heaven, when the cloud received him out of the sight
of the Gallileans that guned outwardly after him! To this also I may answer
(unto thee who look daily for his personal appearance and coming?) if the
heavens must contain him until the restitution of all things; why do thou
thus so much expect his coming before that time of the restitution of all
things? or can thou say, that that time is come; if not, let it come first,
before thou so earnestly expect his coming; but indeed it is but a cloud that
has received him out of the fight of the gazers; but says the Lord (to his
children) I have blotted out your iniquities like a thick cloud, and to the
people, your sins have separated between me and you, and have with held good
things from you. And indeed this has hid both his body and face from you; for
the kingdom of heaven, and the Lord from he aven comes not with outward
observation, but the kingdom is within, and the Lord from heaven is that
quickening spirit which quickens them that have been dead in the sins, and the
trespasses (the clouds of separation,) that they might live unto God, and
behold the beauty of the Lord in his temple; which temple they are in whom he
dwells, and in whom he walks, and he is their God, and they are his people; and
the day being come, and the Sun risen, the clouds and the shadows are fled
away; but they who live in iniquity are dead unto God, whose God he is not, the
cloud is still between, that they can neither see darkly as in a glass, nor face
to face, but are in darkness, clouds and blindness even until now.

But if the inquisitive mind be not yet answered, but art still saying as they
did in the Apostles days concerning the Resurrection How does the dead rise?
and with what body do they come? I must answer unto thee as he did, Thou fool,
that which thou sowest it not that body that shall be, etc. But the Lord gives
every seed it is own body as it pleased him; It is sown A natural body, but it
is raised a Spiritual body; It is sown in weakness, but it is raised in power,
a Spiritual body, raised in power; now can thou tell what body this is; But
if thou understand it not, thou have little or no knowledge of the mysteries of
God, I speak to the shame of that inquisitive mind, that would know these
things which are hid in Gods treasury; and yet will not come to the door, nor
the keys that gives the understanding of them; without which no man can enter
this Kingdom (which is prepared for that birth to which only it be longs) for
no man knows the things of God, but by the Spirit of God, which searches all
things, yea, the deep things of God, which are spiritually discerned: So that
unless you come to the Light and Spirit of God (the door) that reproves the
World for sin, and lets you see the evil of your ways, and obey it, enduring
the cross, and bear the condemnation and in dignation, because you have sinned
against the Lord, and turn at his reproofs, that he might power forth his Spirit
upon you, and make his words and secreta known unto you; I say, unless you
enter in this way at Gods Light and Spirit that shines in your hearts, you shall
never rightly know, understand, or enjoy any of these things (of Gods Kingdom)
before mentioned, it is, an infallible word of Truth from God unto you all. For
they are hid perpetually from the out-birth of the wisdom of this World, and
revealed only to the Babes in the inward spiritual ground in Christ Jesus, who
is still a mystery hid to the professors, Scribes and Pharisees, rulers,
elders, and hypocrites, as well in this age, as in the ages past, who then were
saying among themselves (notwithstanding his mighty works which were done among
them) Is not this the Carpenters Son, whose Father and Mother we knew, and are
not his brethren and sisters among us; etc. Undervaluing and contemning his low
and mean appearance (who was in the form of a servant) and these did love to
be called of men Master, and greetings in the market, and upermost Rooms at
Feasts, and to go in long robes and stand praying in the chief or highest
places in the Synagogues, and were the blind Pharisces to whom the woe
belonged, as at this day it does to them who in the same spirit are contemning
the low appearance and manifestation of the Son of God, saying, Is not this
(you preach or declare of) which people must believe in natural Light, even
this which checks and reproves us for sin? Have we not had this always with us
from our childhood? and do not we know its father and moher? Is it not some of
the remainder that was left in Adam after he fell; to restrain him and his
children from gross evil etc. And is it at best any other then restraining
grace, and not saving? or but natural conscience, and the like? this has been
the reasonings amongst many, though mighty works has been done, and are yet a
doing, and must yet be done by him (who is the Light, the Power, the Grace, the
Truth, and the Wisdom of God) in these last days thorowout the earth.

But O ye Children of men, and high in the tree of Knowledge (which is forbidden
as to seed upon) let me answer these your reasonings with a few questions in
Gods Wisdom, which is hid from the eyes of the prudent of this World, etc.

1. What was that seed, and where was it, after man fell (which was promised)
that it should bruise the Serpents head? And what is that Serpent, and where is
he, whose head must be bruised?

2. What was that which let Adam see his Nakedness when he had transgressed?

What are the Eyes of the Lord that are in every place, beholding the evil, and
good; and where are they if not in every conscience, seeing the Lord says to
his faithful, I will guide thee with mine eye?

3. And what is the true Light that Lights every man that comes into the
World; and what is that Light of men that shines in the darkness (which the
darkness comprehends not) and where is it, if not in the conscience of every
man?

4. What grace is that, and where is it, which has appeared unto all men,
which brings salvation, which is the Saints teacher; is it only restraining,
and not saving? seeing the Scripture says it brings Salvation.

5. What Light is that of which the body shall be full, if the eye be single?
and what is that single eye, or the one eye with which it is better to go to
Heaven, then with two into Hellfire? and what is that eye which is the Light
of the body, seeing the eye of the Lord is the guide?

6. And what makes the difference between the wise Virgins and the foolish? and
whether the Lamp without oil, and the light burning, be not the form or
profession without the power and life which saves from sin, and gives an
entrance into the everlasting Kingdom of God?

7. What wise man is that (which Solomon speaks of) whose eyes are in his head?
and what is that fool whose eyes are at the ends of the earth?

8. And what is that prudent man, which foresees the evil, and hides himself?
and what did he hide from? and in what is the sure hiding place, and what gives
the foresight of evil? what is that fool which passes on and is punished?
and what is the head of every man?

9. Whether the fear of the Lord be not the beginning of Wisdom, and to depart
from evil be not understanding? and whether they who are not yet come unto
the fear of the Lord (which is to depart from evil) be yet come to the
beginning of true wisdom; and if not yet come to the beginning, it is possible
they may be the fools which may dye for want of wisdom, if they do not
speedily repent and turn to him that smites them for their folly, etc. So take
this for an answer till thou know further, of which much might be said, and
of this kind, but a few words to the wise may be enough.

Concerning Christ second coming, and Kingdom, and Reign; and of the Kingdoms
of this World becoming his Kingdoms.
I Never read in all the Scriptures (as I can remember) of a third coming of
Christ personally, in his own fingle person, or of a personal reign besides
what shall be in his Saints. But I have read of his coming the second time
without sin unto salvation etc. which the Apostles in their days did witness;
yea, even his coming and Kingdom as may be mentioned hereafter. I believe most
people (in that called Christ endom, who have read the Scriptures) will confess
Christ is come once already, even when he had the body prepared which he laid
down and took up without the gates of Jerusalem; this I grant was a personal
coming, or the God head dwelt in that person bodily, this we conclude was his
first coming to be manifest in these days; and we believe all the things that
are written of him to be really true; and that whatsoever he did or said must
be fulfilled, etc.

But now this being his first coming, he tells his disciples while he was yet
with them, that he must go away, and that it was expedient that he should go
away, or else (said he) the Comforter will not come, the which if I go away I
shall send unto you, even the Spirit of truth, which shall abide with you for
ever, etc. Yet notvvithstanding sorrovv had filled their hearts, though he tell
them he would come again unto them, and their heart should rejoice, and their
joy no man should take from them; This was his promise to his disciples,
while he was yet personally with them; and to comfort and strengthen yet
more, he told them, that he that was with them should be in them, etc.

For they loved his person for the sake of the frame and quality of the spirit
that dwelled in him; or else what was his person (being mean and contemtible)
to them, more then another person, but for that which dvvells in him they
loved him; let none mistake, I do not slight it, nor the person of any of his
brethren, or children, as they are prepared to do the will of their Father;
but I do know in Gods Counsel that it was even so, as it has been also in
these days among whom God the Father of mercies has as it were deprived some
of his disciples of the personal presence of some of his dear sons and
servants, which may be to this end, that the same Spirit and Life might be
felt, possessed, lived in, and enjoyed in themselves, in their own particulars,
in which only their eternal well being consists,

And so he taught them to pray, Our Father etc. Not to look at his person, and
pray to him as a person without them, but bid them pray to their Father which
sees in secret, who would reward them openly; and he that sees in secret,
searches the heart, and tries the reins: and he bid them pray, thy Kingdom
come, and the Kingdom of Heaven is within, and the heart and reins and the
searcher of them is within; And he bid them wait at Jerusalem till they were
endued with power from on high; and the Kingdom of God consists in power,
etc. So they waited for his coming and Kingdom in their days after his bodily
departure from them, and also came to enjoy what they waited for, and to
receive the promise of the Father, which was fulfilled unto them, and in them,
For says the Apostle, we wait for his Son from heaven; this was after he had
suffered and was departed from them, and at length said, the Son of God is
come, and has given us an understanding that we know him that is true, and are
in him that is true, this is the true God and eternal Life, and this Life is
in his Son; And then again spoke on this wise, We have received a Kingdom
which cannot be moved; letus have grace in our hearts whereby we may serve God
acceptably with reverence and godly fear; for our God is a consuming sire, etc.
So here they received the Kingdom, and the Son of God was come, and they were
in him, who came unto them in his Kingdom: Here was Christ's prayer sulfilled,
who said, That they might be one, as we are one; thou in me, and I in them,
and they in me, that we all might be perfect in one; and here is their prayer
also fulfilled, or ansvvered, who said the, thy Kingdom come, etc. When they
receive the Kingdom which could not be moved; which Kingdom Christ tells them
was within, so this they received and witnessed, which was the second time
unto salvation from sin, who never mentioned (as ever I need) of a personal
coming and reign the third time, or of a third coming in a single personal
appearance, as has been imagined by many, who know not the waiting to be
endued with power from on high, but a running in their own wills and times,
and vvill-vvorships, and feigned humilicies, which is not at all accepted
with God, while that birth is not being, nor that body prepared, which only
can do his will acceptably. But this we have read, of the pourings forth of
the Spirit in the Last days upon all flesh (then none is excepted) and Sons and
danghters should prophesse, (which is come to pass) and that the Lord will come
in ten thousands of his Saints to convince all the ungodly of their ungodly
deeds and hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him, and to
execute his judgments, (this is coming to pass) and that he will consume
Antichrist by the Spirit of his mouth, and destroy him with the brightness of
his coming (then not with carnal weapons, but withspiritual he will destroy
Antichrist) and when this is done, then must the Kingdoms of this world needs
become his, and he shall Reign for ever, and ever. Blessed is the eye that
sees, and the heart that feels and understands these things, for the time is
born, and the day is dawned in which they shall be fulfilled; And this is the
Word of the Lord of Heaven and Earth, who is come to Reign, and reigns, and
will reign till all his enemies are become his footstool; and the Kingdoms of
this world become his Kingdoms and dominions even for ever and for evermore.
Therefore let the earth tremble, and them that fear and obey him rejoice; Amen,
Hallelujah: Amen,

O Thou professor, who are yet a transgressor,
Would thou know the Mysteries of God, thou must first feel his Red,
Which will thy back sunce till thou leave works of night
And walk in the Light, this is the way to know the first day,
And also the rest, which is Holy and for ever blessed.
For Zacheus climbing was too high the Savior to embrace,
But down below he was received in whom Salvation was;
The voice, that from the tree did call, (though below him) he obeyed,
The little stature is not despised, therefore be not afraid.
But come then down into the house, with joy the Light receive,
For he is the Savior of all men that in his name believe.
The tree of Knowledge has beguiled and fed the birth must dye,
The tree of Life has not been known while in the wisdom High.
Men have aspired, and not desired with poverty and thirst,
To walk in the Light, with hearts upright the plain path of the just;
Therefore the Pearl from them is hid who dig not in the deep.
But with the sluggard and the fool in rags and folly sleep.
But now the awakning day is come the trump aloud does sound.
The Life's revealed as in days past man's wisdom to confound.
Therefore all people stand up and see the state in which you are,
For either Heaven, or hells your Lot the hour is not far,
For I have heard from throne of God a dreadful voice and cry,
O England, England, thou art visited and now thy end draws nigh.
Even so hasten thy Work O Lord God Almighty, as thou have showed thy Servant,
and cut it short in Righteousness for thine Elect sake that cries unto thee
night and day thotowout the whole Earth. Even so come Lord Jesus, come quickly,
says my Soul. Amen.

Written by a Servant of the living God, who is a trembler with joy at the
Word of his Power, for whose sake I am in outward bonds, at Hartford; but my
peace can no man take from me, blessed be the Lord (the God of Jacob) whose
compassion fails not, but his Mercies endures for ever and ever, Amen.
