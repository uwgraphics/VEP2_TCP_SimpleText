AN ACCOUNT OF THE Total Defeat of the Rebels in Scotland. By the KING's Forces
At Crawford-John; In a LETTER from a person of Quality to his Friend in London.
SIR,
I Send you the following good news, which I hope will put an end to our
restless Phanaticks troubling our peace for the future. On Thursday the 22th of
July 1680, the General of the Kings Forces having notice that Mr. Cameron (that
Trumpet of Sedition and Rebellion) who lately emitted that most Treasonable and
horridly Rebellious Declaration against the Kings most Sacred Person and
Government, was with a considerable party of Horse and Foot in Craford-John
near Lanericke, he immediately commanded Sir Alexander Bruce of Earls-hall,
Lieutenant to Captain Graham of Clever-house, to take his Troop, and a Troop of
Dragoons, and go in search of the Rebels; who having discovered Cameron and his
Party, who consisted of one Hundred men, most Horse, he Attacqued them so
briskly, that they were forced to Retreat, and betook them to a great Marsh or
Bogg, where the Kings Horse could not come at them; upon which, Sir Alexander
Bruce commanded his Troop and Dragoons to dismount and quit their Horse, and
with great Bravery charged the Rebels on foot, though with great disadvantage;
and after a sharp dispute for half an hour, Camerons Party was totally
Defeated, himself and Fourteen of his men killed on the place (though fighting
the Battles of the Lord, as himself preached some days before) and six Prisoners
taken, amongst which was that Notorious Murderer of the Archbishop of St.
Andrews, Haxton of Rachilet, amongst the dead were two more of those Murderers.
The Prisoners were brought hither this night, together with Camerons Head,
which was carried upon a Poll through the streets by the common Hangman; and so
fare all, who opposes the Kings Person or Government, as now established by Law,

Edinburgh, July 24. 1680. Prays Your humble Servant, etc.
