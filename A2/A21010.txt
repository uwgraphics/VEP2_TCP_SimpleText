The praise of Nothing. By E. D.

The praise of Nothing.
Diverse of singular reputation, to recreate themselves from their grauer
studies, have after the nature of their conceytes written diversely, and that of
such matter, which in the opinion of the people, seemed not worthy the pen of a
mean scholar: in which notwithstanding, they showed no small argument of
their great judgment, that erred at no time less, the^ when it apeared most
idle, and looslye given. For as in the quiet times of states well governed,
Soldiers trained with shows of no danger, and exercised in pleasant marches,
feruentlye covet the hazard of battle: so returned those rare men, from their
lighter labors, more resolute, to bear the heavy burden of their ancient
studies. By imitation of whom may the meaner sort, being also wearied with
other accedents of the world, undertake the like (as the poor help of country
music for a plowemans dumpe) with no less warrantise, then the sheapheard
may the use of his Ofen pipe, Princes having the Cornet, and other excellent
Instruments. For to men that differ in no other circumstance, the^ the
favorable aspect of Fortune, has Nature, being as good mother to the Idiot, as
the greatest clarke, used for one sort of sickness, a like method of cure, as a
mean to mound her children with the true knowledge of themselves, by which
their society, and mutual good will is maintained. This equity in nature
has moved me, as a lenetiue of the mind (though beside my infirmities, I have
many things in common with others) to enterprise the praise of Nothing: which I
confess might have had more ornament, if it had fallen in the hands of the
learned, by whose labors the weakness of the subject might have been helped.
Yet for y^ between the deepth of their skill, and the shallownes of this
matter, there is small proportion: I thought the same more agreeable for my
self, whose judgment has nearest conformity therewith.

Whilst I endeavored to shun Agrippas vanities, and Erasmus follyes, as one
that might have been a pattern of either, I clothed with bare garments this
treatise: for equity would not that Drones feed with the Muses birds, neither
that Arachne weaue in the frames of Minerua. My purpose has not been to
publishe any thing contrary to piety (which with many obseruances, I have
regarded) or in beguiling the time, in which I salve my own sores, to wound
the wandering appetite of such as hunt novelties, and ingorge themselves with
every poison, that has either his outward forces alaide with sweet smelles,
or sauorie tastes.

But I who had rather breed no delight, then betraie the senses, have in
consideration thereof, put this Caveat, that those fictions which be without
order scattered in this pamphlet, be for no other cause laid down, then to
piece with phantasticke artificers, the defects of their inuencion: none being
so hardy to draw Venus without her Uaile, or Mars unarmed.

The weak help of these supposes, I submit to the learned censure of the
godly, who know them to be no otherwise part of any work, then steyning
coullers of one nature, with the table or linen hanging.

I mean not to be jealous of the good report of this treatise, as Appelles was
of his picture: but give leave for all sorts to reprehende me for nothing, for
whose sake I have made appearance of some enmity to all things, neither to
impunge any ground of equity, but to take such measure as I have powered to
others; of whom I entreat no other favor, then that they think it the labor
of him, who windeth quils for the web of Penelope.

The quarrel is not yet ended, which has risen amongst the anciente
Philosophers, touching the original of the world, which some will have to
concern only the earth, and her contents: others the mighty frame of the
universal: every one setting down his several reason, as being loath to have
seemed ignorante of those great matters: when to things in which they had more
interest, being of one creation with the heavens, and the earth, they were mere
strangers, for that light of which Zachary and the Euangeliste spoke, had not
then shined to them, by which they might thorough the thick clouds of nature
behold themselves, a knowledge descended from heaven. For whilst they traueyled
(Curiosity being their guide) to find out in the numbers of Pythagorus, the
moets of epicure, and separated forms of Democrates, the natural cause of the
world, they revealed by chance, the true procreation of nothing: as men in
seeking Mines do first find water, without which there is no store of Mettle
congealed.

This labor although it were not, in dangers equal to those of Hercul^s, yet
is it worthy of great praise, in bringing to light a descent further, then was
either known to Vlpian, or the learned Heralds of that time, since which, no
man has meddled therein: they only endeavoring to find out the original of
Nilus, the causes of his inundations and ebs: the vehement motions of the Air,
and earth, the moving of the planets, their Eclipses, and other accedents.

The profane antiquity therefore, unless by casual means, entreated little
hereof, as of that which by their rule, y^ Nihilex Nihilo fit, contained not
matter of profit, or commendation: for which those Philosophers hunted, as
ambicious men for dominion and empire. Leaving therefore (as men impatient to
abide without the vain praises of the people) that difficult and lawdable
enterprise to the posterity of the children of God, they gave themselves to be
authors of many parcialities and sects: But these latter sort; upon whose
backs this charge was cast, after they had beheld the state of all things,
perceived the cause of their production, to consist of a nature more excellent
the^ they were of: which being without the compass of their schole causes,
must of necessytie be ascribed unto the wonderful omnipotency of God, who by
his divine wisdom, composed the universal substance of nothing: which is by
so much of greater dignity, by how much it has rather pleased the creator to
fram thereof the worthyest creatures. And though it liked Tully, to name the
revealing of these mysteries to the multitude, great impiety: yet think I it
necessary, as a mean to attain to the true knowledge of God, and our selves:
of God, who making all things for man of nothing, is preched to us by the
architecture of this mighty engine of the world: of our selves, who being made
of reasonable souls, and bodies, partake both of the natures of Angels, and
brute beasts: to that end, we embase not with abiecte minds the excellency of
the first, or raise the second higher, then is agreeable to our strength. For
that substance, which we communicate with Angels, being created of nothing,
draws us by a secreter property, to the contemplation of heavenly things,
then the Adament does Iron^ the other, being a native of the earth, inclines
us by a natural impultion, to fire our care thereon, til we fall groueling from
al duty, and (being subject to diverse alterations, and changes, either
increasing, or decreasing with the moon, are fynallye eclipsed with the grave.
This is therefore a matter to be regarded of them, which be rockt in the
pleasures of this world, that the bouye being one descent more from nothing
then the soul, is by many degrees further from all virtue the^ the same: and
that so long, as we retained ye simple of our beginning, we were (as having our
minds regolated by the good order of nature) the lovers of virtue. But after
that the compoundes of the serpent, and our first parents, had rooted in us
these posessiues, Meum et tuum, (the elements of ambicion) we declined from
that age, which in respect of this, and the innocence of that time, was named
golden: tasting in lieue of the pleasant fruits of ye Orcharde of Eden, the
sower leaven of the first error: which so corrupted the whole state of the
world, that as by mo ages, it stood further removed from the time of his
creation: took it also, being newly separated from piety, new names, with
which, his honorable title was extinguished, as having no other effects then of
iron, and therefore now named thereof.

In this proportion, is there to be observed, the nature of both the mettles,
if iron be to be named one, which makes for this matter in hand. For as gold
(being made of nothing, reteineth still his natural property, and substance)
neither yielding to the moistnes of the water, or consuming by the extreme
fury of the fire, is the tipe of those, who despysing all things, are
afflicted for virtue: so iron being artificially made of stones, and showing by
his rust, the uneven temperature of the elements, and malicious influence of
the planets in his composition, prefigureth the ungodly estate of man, wasted
by the flame of concupisence, and cancker of loose life.

The mean to attain perfection, is either to return to that of which al
things were created, or to be still endowed with the simple of the first
creation: which neither ye lower heavens, that over spread the world with
their beautiful lights, or the earth which is contained in the midst of them,
are: it being pronounst by the Psalmist, that they shall wax old as does a
garment: which proves their virtue by succession of times, to diminishe, and
not to be of such efficacy in working, as when they were created of nothing:
since which time, the one has for our sins put on the nature of Brass, and
the other of Iron: as qualities having affinity with our corruption, which
were to be restored by those things, in which it has offended, but that the
abundaunte mercy of God dispaireth, for the nurrishment of his creatures, with
this rule of justice.

The heavenly politic in reforming the disorders of his common weal,
refers us to the beginning, in which was neither corruption of law, or
nature: the like have his disciples done, as to that where lies no suspicion
of il meaning. But such as be crooked followers of this company, and iealious of
the godly antiquity, make all beginninges doubtful, which are of more age
then themselves: and as men utterly ignorante of the grievous soers of their
natural cuntrie, name nothing the cause. Our soueraign gouernes, applies the
easiest remedies of godly surgerie, for preservation of the whole body: but in
this, they be no otherwise deceived, then in those actions which be squared
with the rule of error. For as these Mal Contents, of the vatiean Serraglio,
use (contrary to the sincere purity of the sacred word, and imitation of the
holy Fathers) profane and supersticious worshipping of God, in stead of
adoring him in truth, and verity: in like manner, have many enormities been
perpetrated for nothing, with no less fury, then as though all the powers of
nature, had consented to beat reason from the stearne, and to sincke the
vessel of sound judgment: to which notwithstanding, we ought not to attribute
the cause of ill effects: The goodness of wine being not impaired, though some
take the Moon for a candle, or the Sun unprofitable, for that others are
scorched with the heat: which hurt not in respect of their qualities, but by
mean of the pacients indisposition: so nothing, entering the empty minds of
diverse personages, with that motive, which some schole men doubt to make either
an accedent, or a substance, and therefore by conjecture nothing also: stirs
them (as the air of the fire, moves either light or dry things) by some
power of the first nature: from which because they as now excluded: they
follow their several affections, whether it be in grave or light matter, as
Wolves quarrelling with lambs, for troubling the ^treme beneath them, or men
seeking cudgels to beat dogs for waging their tails. For proof, let us
descend to a particular example of the way ward qualities of old age: which
though it be reverenced with many ceremonies, and enterteyned with no
commodities of the world: yet remains it inpacient of either fortune,
consuming for nothing in great frowardnes, the residue of their brittle years:
or as fondly turning over the leaves of their last times, as having put of the
sobriety of ancient men, or the shamfastnes of young children: bestow the
remnant of their life in making Sonets, in smothing their wrinckled skin,
coulloring their white hairs, perfuming ye venimus exhalations of their
stomaks, and carrolling we rattling voice their amorous Villanella: although
without hazarding the loss of some tooth, they open not their hanging chappes,
more fearful then the grave.

Many other things unseemly that time, are intemperatly passed by them, as
though a doting liberty, gotten by some colloure of long experience, and
imitation of light men, might more warrant their safety, then a wild Ape,
deceived by the hunters: with whom whilst they would seem to be that which
they are not, they pittifullye forgo ye which they be: making that in which
there is no vice, the shade of their ill doing, and with little children (being
demanded the cause of their action) answer it is for nothing.

To which notwithstanding, there is no enemy so capital, as these dotards,
and light estate of lovers: who never liked Homer, or his muses, accompanied
with nothing: according to the ground of their poet: with Muses though thou
comst accompanied Homer, if thou bring nothing, ibis Homere for as: yet have
many of them therefore vowed themselves to the suspected holiness of Paulina,
who more favored Mundus, in the person of Anubus for nothing, then in the habit
of a Roman knight, with his xx, Miriadas.

It mattereth not that Cleopatra was more chargeable to her Corporalls: so that
the rest of that sect, who by their sober conuersations, and mildnes of nature,
are to alay the bitter accedents of man's life, were excluded these actions: for
that their loosenes, is the looking glass of man's sin, and (according to
this rule, that who strikes with the sword, shall be stroke with the scabarde)
a pronounced reward of their husbands error.

Miserable is that course, and contrary to the nature of honesty, to ascribe to
nothing their disloyal parts: but so do they, that under their own test,
they may be convinced of many faults, and their condemnation be greater.

Some others there be, by a marvelous indisposition of honesty, (who although
they be guarded with mo felicities, then diverse ages before them have tasted)
and courted we many favors of her Majesty, floate notwithstanding over the
landmarke of due obedience, for no other cause, if they were well examinied,
then for nothing: a matter not agreing with their impiety, which yearly
renueth with Aphrica, some monster, nursed in their mutinus conferences, where
being impatient of any season, they would draw the governments of Princes, to
the ordinary rule of themselves, capitulating their favorers, with special
noats of good will: and cancelling the good names of the rest, with infamous
titles: as though that men, and not God, had the erecting of kingdoms: which
whilst they frame in the air, with the rebellious Ciclops, they undermine
their natural dwellings, and country walls: thinking to be made no small
fools, in that they be, by those means known to Italy, France, and Spain:
when kings, whose secpters be supported with prudence, and justice, never
reckned the executioners of their furye, within the College of good men, or
thought the reward of such mastiues, any other then garbage.

A portion to good for that course, which is made miserable, in being suspected
to them, from whom they look for all favor and good will: a matter to be
reserved by great estates, for honest men, least their own people (by an ill
president) be drawn from the duty of good subjects, and recompense their
Princes error with disobedience: the same happening by the just judgments of
god, which hitherto never failed, to minister them, who have made themselves
stumbling blocks to their neighbors, new matter with which they have been
fearfully entangled, to the terrible example of the whole world.

Let them therefore deal uprightly with all men, that judge the earth, and not
abuse the amity of virtuous Princes, for overthrowing a good cause: or alienat
themselves, or peaceable ordinances from their willing subjects, to the hazard
of their whole interests: as though their desires were to see the order in
nature troubled, and to be the last whose eyes should behold the ruin of all
things.

It were a romth for some idle body, so look into the accedents of every
state, which has been diversely afflicted for nothing: or to peep into every
dwelling, for examining this cause, which fathereth many novelties, and such
enterprises, as are either bloodily executed, or performed against the use of
common sense: as though those things were lawful to wise and valiant men,
which are not permitted idiots, or thought natural for brute beasts.

In this lowest degree of reason, Xerxes the greatest prince, and least wise of
his time, by an unspeakable folly, acquitted all other of extreme blockishnes:
for whatsoever any dedicated to that Lady or dame he seruilly loved, applied
this forgetful king to a plane tree, putting thereon his Diadem, yielding
humbly thereto his scepter, and complaining with such iestures, as be either
dissembled by wise lovers, or plainly used by simple fools: accursing that
day, and night, in which neither Sun or Moon, spread on him the shadow of his
beloved boughs, which had in such sort bereaved him of judgment, by gathering
in the sweet air, by their soft moving, that his care of the Persian
gouermente lay under foot, more esteeming the compass of earth, which
enclosed the root of their trunck, the^ his several gouerments, and large
dominions: which in his conceipte were no otherwise beautified, then by giving
nurrishment to the same.

Of like passions, may large volumes be written, though worthy of no other pen,
then a black coal: or memory then was by decree of all Asia, left for the
burner of Dianas temple. And although nothing is absolutely simple, innocent,
and harmless in it self, yet therefore has all impiety been set abroch, duties
abrogated, virtue suppressed, truth put to silence, and charity purst, which
should be current amongst men: by which peruersio^, nothing has found no
less favor* then the rich stone by luster of his foil, or as the fair
mistress, by the company of browning her maid.

It shall be necessary in respect thereof, to observe a like proportion, in
disciphering ye incomodities of those things we esteem profitable, to that
end, we may more apparently perceive the good effects which come of nothing,
as of the least, or no enemy of life, by whose society many evils depart,
which as murderers of peace, either draw us from the favor of God, or bring
us into the uncertain liking of the world: in which there was never any, but
that he was continually foste and made seasicke, or suffered extreme wrack of
life, or other fortunes. And although the opinion which we conceive of this
trashe, has a like dominion in us, as white or black in other coullors: we
nevertheless gaze thereon, we no other admiration and danger, then Narcissus
beheld his beautiful reflection, or chearishe it then as the frozen serpent, in
the warm bosom of the idiot: by mean whereof, we render many times a
sorrowful testimony of our light choice, and dangerous affections. The knot
of this mystery has closed the best wits, for giving judgment, in this
repugnancie in nature, vz: y^ whilst every one desires a long and peaceable
time, he yet hunteth after the use of those things, which frowardly abridge ye
good course of life. It is therefore no marvel, though this supernatural
motive, has been condemned of them, who esteeming al things by their weight
and fashion, have for their purpose, this crooked saying. Somewhat has some
savor, not weighing consideratly, y^ as by those instruments by which we
perceive any pleasure common to man, we partake also a thousand incomodities,
which flock without number to cross the joys of life: which so withers
with any sorrow, as though we had dwelt in continual calamity, and never
felt other then the passions of extreme misery. Compaire the joys and
sorrows, which grow of corruptable things, and there will be sufficient reason
minstred, to confirm this argument. For beginning with the state of marriage,
from whence the maids of Greece reckned their age: who are they, that after
the death of their beautiful, and chaste wives: or contrary wise of their
rich and loving husbands, that think not their time past vanished, the
present perished, and their life following desolate? reckning the remembrance
of their old joys, the mother of their new sorrows, and lamentable state.
Or what natural parent, being deprived of good children, does not more lament
their loss, then he rejoiced of their lives? which being carefully feared,
were by so much the less pleasant to him, who now sorroweth them with many
tears, as having lost the Image of his youth, the lantren of his sight, and
staff of his old age. Touching the powers of man (whose corrupt nature,
windeth as a hop wier, as well about weeds, as herbs) they stand us in so
small stead, that when we have most need of them, we are to seek their help.
For whylest one of them empeacheth the others function, the outward senses
wanting by that mean a moderator, take one thing for an other: observing no
order in quantity or quality, but filling all things with iarrs, verify the
saying of the Prophet: by hearing you shall hear, and not understand, and
seeing you shall see, and not perceive. If these two senses which have a
pre-eminence above the rest (as well for the necessary use of life, as that by
their means, we taste of the loving goodness of God) be by the divine Oracle
unprofitable for us: what is to be said of the other parts of our body which
make us by diverse insolences iniurius to God, and man? but that we have in each
of them many deformities, as though the losenes of our life, were appointed the
foil of virtue, or that honesty could not be expressed without her contrary.
The charitable looking upon the torn leaves and poor afflicted members of
Christ, greatly profits no doubt the dulnes of our bodily sight: which being
seen and not relieved, argues us of incrudelitie toward the head, whose
parts they are. Furthermore to behold in our sensuality, and not in the
singlenes of the eye, the beautiful proportion of the world, the wonderful,
and unchangeable course of the heavenly bodies, the marvelous motions of those
huge heap of waters in the Sea, and daily renewing of his other creatures,
which preach to us the infinite wisdom and power of God, in the composition of
this mighty frame, be likewise testimonies of our darkness, and gross
ignorance.

For better explayning this matter, in which with full consent the world has
willingly erred: let us, although there is not any thing so agreeable to nature,
as the society of every living thing in his kind, yet view the consequent
effects of that fellowship, and we shall for the most part find it so hurtful to
our selves, that in respect of our mutual enmity, we are (by our own censures)
judged Wolves one to another. For whether it be for the desire of dominion, or
to have comendation for wit, strength, or comlines before others, seldom is
there peace: and when it happens, it rather gains us opportunity to break
into greater violences, then to set the good slips of virtue: which if we
plant, they prosper as growing out of their natural soil. It is not therefore
to be marueiled, if we regard all circumstances, though the other creatures
of God be enemies to us: when our powers and natural parts descent amongst them
selves, and one man with great hatred prosecuteth an other. For after the chain
of our obedience (by which we were tied to the favor of God) was broken, all
his other creatures grew weary of our Empier, and as our professed enemies
opposed themselves, in the quarrel of their creator against us: either utterly
refusing our company, as that which is supposed dangerous, or so rebelliously
obeying, as they seem our Masters, unto whom we ow our service, for providing
their food, and other necessaries: for which they (being desirous to shake off
the yoke of their bondage) yield no other recompense, then the stripe of
horn, heel, or tooth: unless by our tirranie, they be made the unwilling
seruitors of our appetits. For some resolucion of this matter, let us behold
the natural contradiction of the simple sheep, who by a secret instinct,
rather chooses to go naked, by clothing the briars with her wool, and to
venture her sielie body in company of her ravening enemies, then her natural
owner should be posessed of either. Furthermore, there is not any living thing,
being not joined to our fellowship by some necessity, whether it be the small
unclean Fly, or the hurtful and laborsome Cmot, that willingly draws to y^
^ame, but to anoye us: or those things of which we make our profit, conspiring
with great malice against our lives and commodities, for which they lie in
wait, as for a pray due to them, for our transgressing the sacred ordinances
of God: by whose decree, not only they, but the elements also have broken that
amity they had at the beginning with man: anoying our bodies inwardly by their
uneven proportion, and no way failing to oppress our weak estate, by their
outward effects.

For setting aside how the water ouerfloweth our cattle, perishes our fruits,
and drowneth our bodies, may we behold a malice greater then belongs to
lawful enemies, in casting them up to be devoured of Fowls and beasts, who
are made honorable sepulchers to our miserable carcases: and not yet satisfied
with this triumph of us (whom she finddeth beyond al hope, received of these
common adversaries) proceeds with no less fury (by mean of the other
elements) against the remnant of them which perished by her former cruelty, in
yielding fulsome vapors, which being drawn by some quality of the fire, are
willingly received of the air, to be sucked of them, who thereby are made
parents of mortal diseases, and long infirmities. Nether have we any peace with
the earth, a daily and sullen enemy to man, which either by her quaking, in
bearing the heavy burden of our uncleanness, murdereth many: or being mindful
how her beauty faded in the deluge, for our iniquity, so opposes her self
against our labors, that in gathering one ounce of things necessary, we bring
in therewith two pound of sorrow, powdring our meat with sighs, mingling our
drink with tears, and slumbering in deep care, as having many calamities more
attendant then our shadows, which forsake not our payned bodies, til they have
delivered them for a full satisfaction, to this greedy creditor the earth.

The ordinary of Tantulus were rather to be wished, then those things or their
effects, which by a populer opinion, are named profitable: and thereof durst I
make some native of Platoes den, the Palemon: to whom, although Epicure had
showed the beautiful buildings of Corinth, the sweet perfumes of Thebes, the
plentiful tables of Capua, or magnificence of the Roman Empire, would judge
them far unmeet for the safe conversation of man: who with this fraught, may
as easily ariue in the heavenly port, as a Camel may pass the eye of a
Needle. It is worthy of some observation to behold the enmity which the other
creatures besides man, as well sencible as insencible, have between their
several kinds, as the Serpents and Fire, being things sencible and insencible,
Oil and Cowcumbers, feathers of Doves and Eagles, being both insencible, the
small bird Egitus and the Ass, being both sencible, etc. especially for that
there is no hope left to gather profit by the use of these things, which are so
incomodious to themselves. It seems Byas, or as it pleases some Stilpo,
disagreed not from this argument, who in flying naked the town of his birth,
which contained both his friends and substance, y^ were at one instant in
hazard of burning: answered them, who willed him more carefully to regard his
loss. Al those things which be mine I take with me: inferring thereby, that
virtue is the only ornament and possession of a wise man: all other things
being but snarles to entangle honesty, and to cast us headlong inso much
misery.

Of that opinion were many other, who beholding our states buffeted by
prosperous or adverse Fortune, utterly condemned the life of man, as y^ which
by the use of worldly things was made the storehouse of many evils.

The consideration hereof, ministered Heraclitus large floodes of tears, and
clouds of sighs, as unfeigned witnesses of his continual mourning, for those
miseries with which he beheld our lives filled and made lamentable. The self
same caused Democritus to laugh at them, and their madness, that thought all
other times then those, in which they pursued the causes of their short life,
or infinite trouble, lost. They both agreeing, that our lives be so deluded
with the world, as the vnwarye bird, by the Fowlers call, or the greedy Trowt,
by the sundry coulors of the fethered hook.

In all these matters may we behold the true portraits of sorrow, laid forth
with the deceiuable coulors of Anagirus, were we not such, which by custom,
like as well the reflections of light, as the natural brightness of the Sun: or
as children ill learned to forgo with Esau for Porrage, a land that flows
with heavenly food.

And although we deserve no better (if we respect our own worthynes) then a
surplus of those evils: yet for that they may be separated by an other trade of
life, I condemn them as means, to draw us from piety, or by which we are
inferior to brute beasts, who are far from those affections, with which we be
burdened and thrown down.

I may appeal in these matters, from common opinion, to the Citezens of the
world, whose experience knows we be no otherwise made of, then of Sirenes,
or pitied, then of Crocodils: but each way assailed with flatteries, and
supposed compassions, as a people il guided to discern of our adversaries. This
duly considered that all things be either naturally our enemies, or by our
error in using them, made unprofitable: let us as men made wise by our own
perril, make much of their contrary, by whose benifite we find some
inclination to honesty, or by whose mean, we lose not our lives, credit, and
peaceable state: but may have in respect of our security thereby, one
countenance with Iuuenals passenger: when others having their hearts heavier
then their pursses, curse with the weary Spainard, the titles of Crosses,
they being turning marks of high ways, far from the dwelling of men:
honoring on the other side the wheel, and gibbet, as signs of rest, being
placed near to Towns, and Cities.

The affinity which has been ever between nothing, and the poverty of men,
makes the one hardly to be discerned from the other in the possession of their
owners: the effects of both, being the cause of good arts, and invention of
some new matter profitable to the world. For the mind being at no time idle,
or as some will have it, neither always well occupied, and not impeached with
foreign causes, traueileth to bring forth somewhat of excellent quality, and
therefore have I marueiled at the idleness of those times which had leisure to
establishe this saying. Poverty is an enemy to good manners, a proverb
amongst us: the same being necessary for the knowledge of our selves, that are
by the contrary most insolent and intolerable. Dionisius whilst he had the
pomp of a King, was esteemed of all men tirranius, and being expelled his
realm, named for his temperance, and wisdom, a Philosopher. Alexander of
Macedonia, being (for his dominions) wounded with the holy flatteries of
Jupiter Hamons Priests, of a sober Prince became violent: as he terriblye
expressed in the miserable fortune of his faithful counceller Clitus, and the
lamentable state of Persepolis: by which and such like he brought himself in
hatred of his people, by whose service he passed many hazards of battle, which
then were had in admiration, and now scarce believed of those, that have not
traueiled in the divine Oracles of Daniell, and other wrighters (touching that
matter) of good report. For such were the disagreements of affections in this
Prince, that whilst he esteemed the contents of the world, he exceeded all the
great men of his time in losenes of life, and extreme cruelty: and contrary
wise, when he feared nothing, and reverenced the lovers thereof, as he confirmed
by visiting Diogenes in his Tun: there was none gained so easily the hearts of
all men as he: being by their whole consents judged worthy, for his magnimitie
and temperance, unto whom the world ought only to yield his obedience.
Notwithstanding this opinion received by all men of him, repaired he (as I
said) to the straight lodging of Diogenes, as unto him with whom he had near
equality in nothing.

The which this good Philosopher had in such estimation, y^ he offered therefore
daily supplications, to those Images which were erected in the public places
of Athens, for ye memory of their good Citizens: although some hold, he
observed this custom to that end he might more patiently bear the denial of
such necessaries, as he sought at the hands of rich men.

But how improbable their opinion is, the conference between him being in his
Tun, and Alexander standing between the sun and the mouth thereof proves. For
after Alexander found that confirmed by his own experience, which he heard
reported by others, touching the excellency of Diogenes wit, and the rare
quicknes of his spirit: and seeing him with a mind greater then belongs to
a man in adversity, to contemn both life, and other matters of the world, he
studied according to ye worthiness of himself, to nurrishe those virtues by
somewhat, that might be agreeable to the magnificence of a King: and therefore
encorraged Diogenes (whom he found not stored with any thing in his Tun, which
served for all weathers) to ask possession, or other necessaries. But Diogenes
who resolutely adicted him self to that dwelling, which he preferred before
the Areopage, and Courts of Kings: and unto whom the least matter in the favor
of nothing seemed grievous: required Alexander in lieu of his offer, to remove
his shadow, that had entered the mouth of his Tub, as that wherewith his lodging
was over charged, ye same being only reserved for him and nothing.

Esope who painted to us by Birds, Fishes, Serpents, and four footed beasts,
the form of an honest and safe life, being taken with the enemy, and made
subject (with fools) to misery, was with other bondme^ offered to be sold to
Xantus the Philosopher, and being demanded by Xantus what he could do, to that
end he might thereafter rate his price, changed not with his fortune his
opinion: but answered, as if he were rather to be esteemed of the byer, he
could do nothing.

Xantus who became master to this Esope, and knew the treasurers of nothing,
to be the paimaisters of Phylosophie: to make trial with what judgment, his
new servant affirmed himself able for nothing, and desirous as well to see a
lover, as a doer thereof: had brought to his house by his commandment, and the
conduction of Esope, one that loved nothing: whom Xantus enterteined with great
fare, and for a Phylosophicall conclusion, and want of other melody, to
furnishe that feast, counterfeited the invention of Pithagoras music on his
wives back: who singing a sorrowful plain song thereto, ministered such cause
of mirth to his gueste, that he fell from the boorde with extreme laughter: by
which Xantus knew the great judgment of his man, in finding the owner of this
Jewel, whom he caused to be solemnly co^ueied out of his house upon four men's
shoulders, as that which was not worthy to lodge so honorable a person: an act
answerable to the high renown of this learned Philosopher.

Socrates who by the Oracle of Apollo, was named the profoundest man of that
time: out of whose springs Plato drank the sweet licor of his Phylosophie:
who though he might with warrantise, in respect of that praise, have challenged
the first place for his universal knowledge: yet he esteming the same as a
matter contemptible, made his choice to know nothing only: as by which he
found the way to virtue more safe, and with less danger. This purpose he
changed not at that time he went to dye for inueighing against the Athenians
adoration of Idols. For even then, when Xantippa his wife, the same Xantippa
(who not long before as a good Scholemistresse to learn him the sufferance of
adversity, had powered a vessel of cold water on his head) saw her temperat
companion (who had long been the packehorse of her household actions) taken
from her by his Idolatrus Citizens, pitifully lamented (as being perhaps
pleased, to be otherwise honestly rid of his Philosophical rules) that he
should suffer for nothing. But Socrates, who at no time was unlike himself,
gladly confessed to die willingly for nothing, for whose sake he had named him
self ignorant of all things: and therefore blamed her, that rashly misliked
the cause, by which he was made innocent of any crime, that might slander his
life to the world.

Caius Caesar, being of that magnanimity, that the world difficultly contained
his greatness, to sound the disposition of the Senate, preferred diverse suits to
them for himself, and favorers: but they as men iealius of the Roman state,
and muffeled with the over sight of their fatal destiny, granted (not
knowing what) nothing: a matter taken of Caesar in better part, then if they
had made him perpetual Dictator: as by which being no way their debtor, he
took occasion to enter upon them, and their liberties, and consequently to
cease the large domains of their Empire into his hands: whereas if they had in
the beginning alaide the heat of his ambition, with the ordinary hope of
other sufers, he had given place to some other, who had chastised their
gormandise, that brought them in hatred of all men.

The opinion which these great Princes, and excellent Philosophers conceived
of nothing, might confirm others of meaner judgment to be on their side: if
either y^ good events which have risen thereof, or the authority of the wit, or
valor of those rare men, were of force with the people: who we small labor are
made attentive to behold Iuglers, and to creadite their craft, as a matter of
no more deceit, then the tears of light women.

But in as much as these profane presidents, are not of sufficient weight, to
draw those who dissembling the love of nothing, snatch with Esops Dog at the
shadow of their bone: let us behold what method of teaching yt contempt of
transitory things (and the love of their contrary) was used of our heavenly
Doctor, who what rule soever he laid down to be followed of his people, he
first practiced (as a good lawmaker) in himself: refusing (natural order
being perverted) the managing of temporal things, as ill furniture for the
policy of yt kingdom. He framed his Saints: who being more beloved of God
then the Lilly or young Raven: (the one beautified and the other nurrished,
without any help of the world, or nature) are to exspect greater succor in
their infirmities, and stronger aid. How unprofitable mouldes the world and
nature are to cast the form of a godly perfection, he has drawn with quick
coullors in the person of the rich man, who is not by ye sacred rule made
perfect, unless he sell all that he has, and gives the same to them that
have nothing.

Great is the excellency thereof, whose owners be the objects of charity, which
(to cloth her naked children) seeks not those things which be her own: and
no less expedient for our righteousness, which is made perfect by possessing the
same: an act to be regarded for our payment, which neither the robber takes,
or is made corruptible by the rust, or moth. When contrariwise to entertain
them that taste the fat of the earth, is without hope of reward: unless the
casters of water into the Sea, are to be praised for their charity. Amongst
other passages which may be cited for this purpose, leaving the ordinances of
Moses, which rejected such as were solicited with worldly business, as persons
utterly unprofitable for warlike discipline: the same being a tipe of the life
of man, named no other then a Pilgrimage, or warfare upon earth. Christ's loving
imbracements of the little children (who cared for nothing) are not of least
importance: for their simplicity being the shadow of our first innocence, is
to be reentred, as the posterne of true godlynes: which lies not open to them
that have the world in admiration, and be not resolute follow^^s of the
childrens ignorance.

As the good scholar of this most excellent Master the Apostle, desired not
to know any thing in Corinth, but Christ crucified: as if he would have said,
setting that most high mystery aside, by which only without any adiunct, or
separated cause, the heavens lie open to us, the rest are to be refused, as
impeaching true godliness. What is there to be gathered hereof? but y^ nothing
furthereth our devotions, and therefore to be made of, before matters of the
world, as the same Apostle, not as I make him speak, but as he further
proves, by adding that the worldely or fleshly man, perceives not those
things which be of God: then which ignorance, there is not any thing anexed
unto the miserable and wretched estate of man of worse quality, the same being
the bend sinister, which deuideth our parts from the inheritance of Gods
children: who are not reputed his, unless they shake off the love of the
world, and themselves, and boast of nothing, as without which, they partake
many things with unreasonable creatures, whose natures by use they put on, and
are made like them in all things, their shapes excepted. For in that sense also
spoke the Apostle, when he laid before the Corinthians some course of life,
which he would they used, as though it were not: which argument, the beloved
Disciple followed, with no less emphasis, then the chosen vessel of God:
forbiding the love of the world, the same being pregnant in it self, to
sequester from our use all society of the heavenly train: which is to one
purpose, as if he had extolled nothing: whose praises he might have more
expressly set down, but that he endeavored to bring the same in favor, by
dispraise of the contrary: as Licurgas commended to his Citizens sobriety, by
showing them the unclean behavior of his drunken bondmen.

This kind of teaching has been used of diverse, when without ^iolence they
intended to remove an evil deeply rooted in our affections: which are not in
weeding their unnatural superfluities, to be pressed with the severe
discipline of ruff censures: least they being made weak by that mean, let
slip the good seeds of virtue, with the cornels of our corruption, as bodies
losing their retentiue faculty, by vehemency of the purge.

But to return where I left, touching the contempt and abject use of worldly
things, Petrarck in his tryumphe of death, newly speaking in our tongue, by an
unlearned tra^slator, mainteyneth the same argument.

THe Popes (says he) the Kings, and who commanded have the world,
Are naked now, misers, and needy persons all,
Now treasures where? now honors where? and precious stones?
And Scepters where? and Crowns, Myters, and purple shows?
He wretched is that lays his hope in mortal things.
But who does not? and if he find himself at length
Deceived, it is reason great, and answeareth well his act.
O senceles men, so much to traueile what auailes?
To the ancient Mother great all shall return at last,
And hardly shall the mention of your names be found.
Of a thousand labors not one a profit yeeldes,
But each of them apparent vanities are known.
Your studies who does understand can tell me this.
With minds inflamde, always to damage of your selves,
What profit is it? so many countries to subdue,
And nations diverse tributaries make unknown,
And after enterprices perilous and vain,
With blood to conquer walled Towns, and treasure get?
A way more sweet is found with water, and with bread.
With glass and wood, then with rich orient stone and gold.
By these hurtful effects and dangerous impressions of all things, I find
great cause why nothing should be more regarded: as well for that it serves al
humors, though by sundry means, as that also the same is enemy, or having
society with things hurtful to man: but a good help, to make him in true
godliness like pacient Job (so much commended of God) who more then yt rest of
men, stood beholding thereto, as unto his inseparable friend, which only
accompanied him into the world, remained with him in his miserable poverty, and
sickness, and lastly returned with him, to his Sepulcher, the gate of his rest
and felicity, in which although no man has in this world a perfection, yet
draws he nerest thereto, either in the prime of life, or decreped age thereof.
The first as was said of young children not caring for the world, and therefore
happy: the other being unfit for the world, and therefore like to be happy. For
in the latter time of man, when all things remain unpleasant to him, not for
that he hates them, but in respect of his want of power (which then wareth
weak) to use them, he makes of his necessity a virtue, and in lieu of his
wonted violences, and over running the world, either restrains himself to
some monastical life, or teaches at home the use of true fortitude and
military prudence: or if weakened by the dangerous assaults of love, he highly
praises chastity, reading to his wife the legend of good women, whereby she
may more pa^iently have fellowship with him in his inuoluntarie abstinence: or
if in his young time he always labored in the fields of Neptimus, he wareth
being old a maker of Carts for Navigations, meaning to recompense the furious
cruelty of his youth, with the charitable compassion of his old age: it is
for the sequal a matter of no small consideration: to behold these particions,
and first the infancy, which having little or no comunitie with worldly
felicities, rests pacified with the abject things of nature, the other being
of many parts (by some participation it has with two faced Ianus) a neuter to
all things.

The contempt, or society of the world, that happens by this necessity, is no
way worthy of praise in us, though (as Vbi desinit Philosophus incipit medicus)
it be an external mean, where by we supernaturallye apprehende, the heavenly
graces, that have no societye with those things, for which we envy, mislike,
or embrace one another: or for which we tear the bowels of the earth, or trust
our selves to the unconstant waves, or ruff seas.

From these dangers of life, if any (by the divine providence) escape, they are
beyond all expectation (when no other thing is left them then a weary
confusion) mightily succored by that divine power, which til then, lies
aloof, as a strong relief for our weak estate.

To this are the testimonies of the scriptures answerable: which witness the
bountious liberality of God, to the needy, naked, miserable, and possessors of
nothing, and his indignation to the mighty, and rich, whom he pulls from
their seats, and sends empty from his presence.

Furthermore, where as the schole men have this ground, that Natura abhorret
vacuum, which is the natural element, or residence of nothing, it consequently
follows, that she also abhors nothing, which makes nothing, by so much of
greater dignity, by how much our nature being perverse is prone to sin, the
only cause of Gods fearful judgments, and heavy displeasures.

These are the effects of nature (an enemy to the Court of nothing) to kindle
on our backs, her bundle of rotten sticks, with the consuming fire of Gods
wrath. I cease not in respect hereof to muse at them before mentioned, that
complain for nothing, (as Proc^is being ielous of Aura) the same remaining a
harmles companion of our life, by whose fellowship, we may say with Cicero,
that we be never less alone, then when we be alone: and by our experience
affirm, that we are not any way so safe, as when nothing is near us: which
having all the parts of trust, on which we may confidently repose our selves,
is to be prefered before any thing in nature: whether it be man (who for his
several perfections is named the little world) with whom diverse unreasonable
creatures, to abate his swelling humors, are equally matched in many things he
claims prerogative: or any other living creature, which for some particular
quality, is noted to be excellent above the rest. For if we look into the
reasonable substance of man, and ap^ composition of his body, nothing is more
absolute in every part then he: if into the courage of the Lion, or force and
docilitie of the Elephant, nothing does apeare of more fortitude, strength, and
aptnes then either: and again if we regard fidelity, meeknes, and prudence of
the Dog, Dooue, and Serpent: nothing goes beyond them in their several
properties, being both enlarged and restrained beyond any substance that is
definit: of whose favor, there is no sort may more boast, then the reverent
estate of the married: for that nothing makes their attonments, renueth their
leagues, and sets order in their household business, ministering in all
seasons such argument of peace: that thy stately Capital (proud Rome) had not
beheld y^ bloody fall of pacified Caesar, if nothing had accompanied him:
neither had Jerusalem been infortunat in the loss of her beautiful Temple,
and mighty walls, if nothing in place of her seditious Captains had taken her
defense, against the terible siege of that good Emperor Titus. And yet had the
France, O honorable Shatilion, beheld thy white hairs and valiant bands, if
nothing had councelled thy King to commend the execution of his displeasurs to
the fearful night: in which Nocte sub obscura, heu flebile Martis opus.
Neither had thy provinces poor Belgia, being the sweet harborough of many
nations, suffered so many violences by the incursions of the Italian, and
Spanishe Armies, had their leaders loved nothing, as they did the sweetness of
the soil, their rich Cities, and beautiful buildings: steynd by their forces
with thy peoples blood, and filled with impiety, minstring to thee, in stead
of thy country laws, a Soldiers liberty, and unto thy neighbors new
motions, whereby they might more opportunely, attend the execution of their
policy: which kindles the fire of thy vain, in the howels of thy people: who
being distracted by their diverse zeales, take arms to expel themselves, and
to fill al parts with the news of their fall. For it accords with equity,
that in what we offend, we be chastised.

Thy medicine for this grief is the unity of thy people, which if (by thy
fatal destiny) it be impeached, learn to submit thy stiff neck and mighty
shoulders, to that yoke under which proud nations have drawn.

I forget not how unpleasant this later council seems to them, who have with
so much blood mainteyned their liberties: yet would I have them esteem that
sweet, which gains their safety, ye either is by the two former means
obtained, or purchased by alteration of times, or surely established by
nothing. Let us in consideration of these contents, in like sort esteem
nothing, as those mighty Champions, and wise men, who blushed not to be
vanquished therewith, either in matter of courage, or wit: for as nothing
maistred them in their professions: so wrought it effectual means for their
preferment, honoring famous Captains for fighting their country battles:
enritching valiant Soldiers, who made their bodies the Bulwarks of the
people: reuerencing ye learned Judge for doing of judgment and justice: and
peaceably chearishing the godly learned, for redifteng the house of God.
Furthermore, from this have many attained to the highest dignities in commonweals, as Alpheus, who of a Tailor, was created Consul of Rome: as also
Velocissimus the Horse of the Emperor Comodus had been, if his master had not
been prevented by death Moreover this is it, which being matched in balance,
with those things the world accounts most excellent, mounteth toward Heaven,
as to his natural Center, the rest discending, as earthly, contemptible, and
vile.

It seems for the sequel of wonderful price, when the professed and common
enemy to man (who more then time deuoureth all things) upon covenant for some
service to an old woman, to have her or nothing (as for the excellency,
impossible to be delivered) had notwithstanding, his insatiable greedines
satisfied, out of a bottomless pitcher, which (this good mother) had hong for
that payment, behind her door.

To conclude, I think no less perrill to be in handling temporal things,
then in pulling up the wonderful root Baaras: one order being prescribde for
our health in both: which consists in touching either, as matters which be
vile and of great danger: and therefore am persuaded that this later age,
cannot but acknowledge sundry benifites which rise of nothing, as that which
nurseth the godly in the love of virtue: and punishes the transgressors of
good laws: without the execution of which two, I doubt how the beam of justice
will stand upright, and give gold weight, what visor of well doing soever is
put on to deceive the world: which being not improperly painted, to be held in
the hand of God, takes not further hurt then is due for sin, and limited by
his divine providence.

I fear I have been offensive to many, for tarying so long on nothing: who
therefore should not (if they duly regard their particular) remain
seuerecensors of this matter: they having either feared, loved, or esteemed
nothing, with greater partiallitie then I have addicted my self to this labor.

The rest which are delighted in the study hereof, I refer to the macheronicall
fantasies of Merlinus Cocaius, and sleepie Phantasmata of Francois Rabilois,
men greatly traueled in this business: which being so well handled of the^ both,
I thought unnecessary to touch any further at this time: mistrusting not, but
many will hereafter with their whole affections finishe the same: of which as
the excellent substance of the heavens and earth were at the first created: so
shall they within few reuolutions of years return, as unto their first
matter: from ye time forth shall iniquitye be unhorsed, that now ouerruneth the
godly with many tiranies, and then shall the good people of God triumph with
the Lamb for ever.

FINIS.
