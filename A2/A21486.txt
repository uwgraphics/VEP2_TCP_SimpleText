secluded out of this our realm ye abuses of the bishop of Rome his auctorite

obedience to any foreyn potent are and al foreyn iurisdictio^s and powers as well
as of the said bishop of Rome as of al other what^ ever they be: as by their
said professio^s and writings coroborated with ye subscriptio^ of their names
and appe^sion of their seals more plainly appears. We let you wit ye calling
unto our remembrance the power charge and commission given unto us of almighty
god, and upon a vehement love and affection toward our loving and faytful
subjects, perceyuyng rightwel what great rest quietness and tranquilite of
conscie^s, and many fold other commodities might insurge and arise unto them,
if that the said bishops and other of ye clargy of this our realm should set
forth, declare and preach unto them the true and sincere word of god, and
without all manner color, dissimulacion, and hipocrist manifest and publyshe ye
great and inuumerable enormities and abuses which the said bishop of Rome:
as well in the title and still, as also in auctorite and jurisdiction of long time
unlawfully and unjustly has vsuroed upon us and our progenitors and al other
christian princes. Have therefore addressed our letters unto ye bishop of ye
dioces straytly charging and co^mau^dinge him in the same yt not only he in his
own propre person, shall declare, teache and preach unto the people forthwt
upon the recept of our said letters unto hi directed, every Sunday and other

orasons, rubrikes, canons in mass books, and all other, books used in the
churches, wherein the said bishop of Rome is named, or his presumptuous and
proud pomp and authorite preferred, utterly to be abolysshed, eradicate, and
rased out, and his name and memory to be never more (except to his contumelye
and reproach) remembered, but perpetually suppressed and obscured, and finally
to desyst and leave out all such articles as be in the general sentence which is
usually accustomed to be red four times in the year and do tend to the glory
and auau^cement of the said bishop of Rome, his, name, title, or jurisdiction.
Whereupon we estemyng and reputing you to be of such syngular and vehement zeele

your wisdom, diligence and labor what so ever should or might be to the
prefermente and setting forward of Gods word, but also practyse, study, and

monicion and commandment given by us unto the said bishop as before is
specyfyed, but also to enquire and straightly charge and command you upon pain
of your allegau^ce and as ye will avoid our high indignacion and dyspleasure
at your utter most peril, layeng a part allvayne affections, respects, or
other carnal co^sideracions, and setting only before you re eyes the myrrour
of truth, the glory of God, the dignity of your souereyne lord and king, and
the great concord and unite and inestimable profyt and commodite yt shalby the
due ^ercutio^ of the premises ensue to your self and al other faithful and
loving subjects, ye make or cause to be made diligent search, wait, and
espial in every place of your ^ryfwyk, whether the said bishop do truly,
sincerly, and without al manner cloak, color, or dyssimulacion, execute and
accomplysh our will, and commandment as is before said. And incase ye shall
bear perceive and approuably understand and know that the said bishop or any
other ecclesiastical person within his dioces does omyt and leave (...) done
any part or parcel of the premysses, or else in the execution and setting forth
of the same do coldely and unfeignedly use any manner sinister addicion, wrong
interpretacion, or painted colors: Than we straytely charge and commau^d you,
that forthwith upon any such defaute, negligence, or diu^imulacio^ by the said
bishop or any other ecclesiastical person of his dioces committed, contrary to
ye true tenor, meaning and effect of ye said charge by us to him appointed
before said, ye do make indelaydly and with all speed and dylyge^ce declaracion
and aduertysement to us and our counsel of the said defaulte, and of the
behauour, manner and fashon of ye same. And for as much as we upon syngular
trust and assured confyde^ce, which we have in you, and for the special love
and zele, which we suppose and think ye bear toward us and the public and
common weal, unity and tranquilite of this our realm, have specially elected
and chosen you among so many for this purpose, and have reputed you such men
as unto whose wisdom, discrecion, truth, and fidelyte, we might commytte a
matter of such great wayght, moment, and importance, as whereupon the unity,
rest, and tranquilite of our realm does consiste and is stablysshed. If ye
should contrary to our exspectacion and trust, which we have in you, and against
your duty and allegaunce toward us neglect, be slack, or omyt to do with all
your dylygence, dexterite and wisdom, whatsoever shall be in your power, for the
due and true perfourmau^ce and execucion of our mind and pleasure to you
before declared in this behalf, or halte, stumble, or wyncke at any part, or

extremly correct, and punish you for the same yt all the world besides shall
take by you ensample and beware contrary to their duty, oath, and allegau^ce
to frustrate, deceive, and to dysobeye the just and lawful commandment of
their souereygne lord and prince insuch things, as the true hearty and
faithful execution. Whereby ye shall not only prefer and advance the honor
and glory of almighty God, and set forth the majesty and imperyal dignite of
your souereyn lord: but also importe and bring an inestimable weal, profit,
commodite, unity, and tranquylyte to all the public and commun state of this
our realm: where unto both by the laws of God, nature and man ye be utterly,
obliged and bound. Y even under our sygnet at our Palace of Westmynster,
the.ix. day of June.

God save the King.
