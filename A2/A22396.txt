By the King. A Proclamation to declare, that all Ships carrying Corn, or other
Victuals, or any Munition of War, to, or for the King of Spain, or any of
his Subjects, shall be, and ought to be esteemed as lawful Prize.
FOrasmuch as the many injuries and indignities, obtruded upon the Kings most
excellent Majesty, and his most dear and only sister, and her children, and
His royal father, of ever blessed memory, deceased, by the King of Spain,
under color of treaties and alliances; the many violences offered by him, to
diverse of His Majesty's Subjects, in taking, slaying, and ransoming diverse of
them in a hostile manner, whilst they intended only their Merchandise at Sea;
The king of Spaines restless ambition to aspire to an universal Monarchy,
discovered to the whole world, to the disquieting of that peace, which other
Princes, and States his neighbors, would gladly rest in and enjoy; Have, out
of an unavoidable necessity, drawn His most excellent Majesty, to take up
Arms against the said King, for the defense of Himself, His Dominions, and
Subjects, and of other Princes and States, His Confederates and Allies, there
being none other safe means for the obtaining of an assured Peace to Himself,
and His Subjects, and to His Confederates, and Allies, which His Highness
shall be ever most ready to embrace, when with safety, and honor it may be
had: His majesty in His Princely wisdom and providence, foreseeing, that,
whilst the said King of Spain continues in these terms and courses of
Hostility, it is neither agreeable with the rules of policy, or Law of
nations, to permit the said King, or his subjects, to be furnished and supplied
with Corn, Victuals, Arms, or provision for his Shipping, Navy, or Arms, if
the same can be prevented. For although these violent hostilities of the said
King of Spain, to the trouble of a great part of the Christian Dominions, are
mightily maintained by the abundance of his treasure from the Indies, wherein
he trusts, and with the opinion whereof he is puffed up: Yet it is manifest,
that to maintain his Arms, and renew his Shipping, his moneys, in their
proper nature, would not suffice, if he were not continually supplied with
Corn, and other Victuals, and furnished with Munition, and materials for
Arms, and Shipping from foreign countries, whereof, neither his Indies, nor
Spain, nor any other part of his own Dominions are able to serve; but the
same are known to be brought into Spain, Portugal, Burgundy, and other his
countries, from other foreign parts, not in his own subjection, and that
especially, from the Hans-townes, and Merchants of the North East Countries,
who for the desire of gain, are contented to furnish the said King, though to
their own extreme hazard, and prejudice of their neighbors, with all things
requisite, to maintain his unjust Wars: For this cause, His Majesty being,
amongst other Princes and States, herein principally interessed, for the
defense of Himself, His Countries, and Subjects, against the said King of
Spaines great preparations of his Nauies, and Armies by Sea, and by Land; and
His Majesty being persuaded, that if such his provisions for hostility, to be
brought unto him by Sea from foreign parts, might be stayed, or interrupted,
until the said King might be disposed to live in peace, His Majesty might
the sooner forbear to continue His charge, in maintaining His forces, both by
Sea and Land, which He is now constrained yearly to renew, only for the just
defense of himself, and His Dominions, and of His Confederats, and Allies:

Does by these presents, by the advice of His Privy Counsel, notify to all
manner of persons of all conditions, that shall send or carry into Spain,
Portugal, Burgundy, or any other the said King of Spaines Countries or
Dominions, any manner of Grain or other Victuals, or any manner of Provisions,
to serve to build, furnish or Arm any Ships of War, or any kind of Munition
for the War, or Materials for the same, being not of the nature of mere
Merchandise, that, as it is lawful for His Majesty, being a Monarch and
Prince Sovereign, and as other Kings in like cases have always used to do,
He will not only authorize His own Admirals, and Captains of His own Ships
of War, serving on the Seas, but will also allow and approve all other His
Subjects, to Arm their Ships at their will, and with them to impeach and
arrest all Ships, that shall Sail, either out of the East parts, or out of the
Low Countries, or from any other Parts, with intention to pass to Spain,
Portugal, Burgundy, or any other the King of Spaines Countries or Dominions, or
to any the said King of Spaines Ships, being on the Seas, having on Board any
such Grain, Victual, or provisions of War, or Furniture for shipping, or
Materials for the same, and the same to bring into the next good Port, there to
be ordered, as Goods duly forfeited for the benefit of His Majesty, where
His Majesty's Ships shall arrest the same, and to the benefit of such others,
as being not in his Majesty's Wages, shall by their travail and adventure have
stayed and arrested such Ships and Goods prohibited: Provided, that all others,
besides the Captains of His Majesty's own Ships, that shall be disposed to
Arm their Ships for this purpose, shall first notify their intent to the Lord
high Admiral of England, making declaration of their condition, of their manner
of shipping, of the Furniture thereof, of the number of men requisite to serve
therein, with their quantities of Victual and Munition, and of all other
things requisite to be certified to the Lord Admiral, which being by him
allowed, thereupon the Owners of the said Ships, and the Captains and
Conductors thereof, to be bound, to His Majesty's use, in good sums of money
for themselves, and, as cause shall require, to the Lord Admiral, with
sufficient Sureties, that they do their best endeavor, without fraud, for
gain or composition, to arrest such Ships, having, as is abouesayd, Grain,
Victual, Arms, Munition, or Furniture for shipping, or any Materials for the
same, intended to be carried to any of the said King of Spaines Dominions, or
Countries, as aforesaid, and likewise to be bound, as is aforesaid, that with
the said Ships, no harm shall be wittingly done to any person on the Seas,
being in friendship with his Majesty, and that shall not be privy to the
carriage of any such Grain, Victual, Provision, Furniture or Materials, into
any the said King of Spaines Dominions, or toward any of his Countries, or to
any the King of Spaines Ships being on the Seas: And in case any shall be found
to have committed any such offense, whereby their Bonds shall be forfeited,
the parties damnified shall be fully recompensed for all their Losses and
Damages, with the sums of money forfeited, and otherwise, as there shall be
cause, and the offenders also severely punished, according to their offenses,
by due course of Law.

Given at Our Honor of Hampton Court, the 31. of December, in the first year
of Our Reign.
God save the King.
