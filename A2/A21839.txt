By the Queen.
THE Queens Majesty is credibly informed, that sundry persons of good
wealth and calling, having their habitation within sundry Shires bordering
upon the Sea coast, have of late time departed from their said houses, and
part of them withdrawn themselves from their houses on the Sea coasts, and
some other part out of the Maritime Counties into Inlande Countries, and many
of them to the City of London, or to places near about, whereby not only
the accustomed hospitality in those places, but specially the ability and
strength for defense of those Countries are notably decayed: Whereof her
Majesty, in respect of her Royal estate and dignity, to whom the special
charge hereof belongs, cannot but give order, and provide speedy remedy for
the same. And therefore, her Majesty charge and commands, upon pain of
her Highness indignation, besides such forfeiture of their lands and goods,
as justly by her authority Royal they may incur, that every person of
(...) degree, which has within these two years next passed before the last
feast of Michaelmas, had habitation in any County that bordereth upon the
Sea, shall, if he be there, so continue his habitation: and if he have removed
from his said habitation to any place more distant from the Sea within the
said two years, than he shall (except he be already restrained by authority
to continue in some places certain) without delay return to his said former
habitation, and within one month after the publication hereof in the said
Counties, shall stable his household in the same former place, with such number
of servants, or mo, as before time were there kept. And because it may so
happen, that by great sickness, or by imprisonment, or such like vnuoluntarie
or unfeigned impediment, this her majesty's commandment cannot be so speedily
performed as her Majesty desires: Her pleasure is, that no excuse shall be
allowed as any just cause for not performance hereof, but such as shall be
within the said month duly certified to any of her Majesty's Lieutenants of
the same place, or in their absence to their Deputies, and by them also
certified to her Majesty, or to her privy Counsel, to be allowed, or for
some time tolerated, and so the parties to receive knowledge of the allowance
or tolleration from the Lieutenants under their handwriting.

Furthermore, her Majesty finds cause, that all manner of persons, that
either are Justices of peace in any countries, or that have any Stewardshippes
of any of her Majesty's Honors, Hundreds, or Manours, or the rule of any of her
Tenants, or that be appointed to any charge either of footmen or horsemen in
any County of the Realm, and that now are either at London, or Westminster,
or any place near thereunto, either by color of suites in Law or otherwise
to soiourne thereabouts, or removed to any place from their most usual place
of dwelling, shall within twenty days after the publication hereof depart
home to their former habitations, except they be such as are Officers
necessarily to attend in any of her Majesty's Courts at Westminster, or that
their absence shall be allowed upon causes to be thought reasonable by any six
of the Lords or others of the privy Counsel, and that allowance or toleration
to be delivered to any such person so to be excused, in writing. And if any
such person as is aforesaid, shall have cause by Process or otherwise to attend
upon any her Majesty's courts at Westminster, her Majesty's pleasure is, that
the Judges of the Court shall so direct their causes, as they may answer by
their atturneys, or else to adiourne their apparances unto the next Term, or
otherwise so to give expedition, as they may depart to their Countries without
cause or excuse. And this her Majesty commands to be without fraud observed
upon pain of Imprisonment, and such fine as according to the qualities of the
offense shall be thought good for the breach of her Majesty's commandment,
tending to the public service of the whole Realm.

Given at Richmond the second day of November, in the nine and twentieth year
of our Reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.
