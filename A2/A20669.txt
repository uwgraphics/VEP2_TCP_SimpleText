Doctor doubble ale.

ALthough I lack intelligence
and can not skyll of eloquence
Yet will I do my diligence
To say sumthing or I go hence
wherein I may demonstrate
the figure gesture and estate
Of one that is a curate
that hard is and endurate
and ernest in the cause
Of piuish popish laws
that are not worth two strawes
Except it be with dawes
that knows not good from euels
Nor Gods word from the Deuels
Nor will in no wise hear
the word of god so clear
but popishnes vpreare
and make the pope Gods pear
and so them selves they lade
with bables that he made
and still will hold his trade
No man can them persuade
and yet I dare say
there is no day
but that they may
Hear sincerily
and right truly
Gods word to be taught
If they would have sought
but they set at naught
Christ's true doctrine
and them selves de^line
to men's ordinance
which they enhaunce
and take in estimation.
above Christ's passion
and so this folish nation
Esteem their own racion
and all dum ceremonies
before the sanctimonies
O^ Christ's holy writ
and think their own wi^
so be far above it
that the scripture to them teachis
Or honest men preachis
they follow perlowes lechis
and doctors dulpatis
that falsely to them pratis
and bring them to the gates
Of hell and utter derkenes
and all by stubborn starkenes
Putting their full trust
In things that rot and rust
and papisticall provisions
which are the deuels dirisions
Now let us go about
to tell the tale out
Of this good fellow stout
that for no man will dout
but keep his old conditions
For all the new comyssyons
And use his supersticions
And also men's tradicyons
And sing for dead folks souls
And read his beade rolls
And all such things will use
As honest men refuse
But take him for a cruse
And ye will tell me news.
For if he ons begin
He leaves naught therein
He cares not a pyn
How much there be within
So he the pot may wyn
He will it make full thyn
And where the drink does please
There will he take his ease
And drink there of his fill
Till ruddy be his byll
And fill both cup and can
Who is so glad a man
As is our curate than /?
I would ye knew it a curate
Not far without newgate
Of a parysh large
The man has mikle charge
And none within this border
That keeps such order
Nor one a this side Nauerne
Louyth better the ale tavern
But if the drink be small
He may not well withal
Tush cast it on the wall
It fretteth out his gall
Then seek an other house
This is not worth a louse
As dronken as a mouse
Mon sire gybet a vous
And there will byb and bouse
Till heavy be his brouse
Good ale he does so haunt
And drink a due taunt
That ale wives make there vaunt
Of many a penny round
That sum of them has found
And sometime mikle strife is
Among the ale wyfes
And sure I blame them not
For wrong it is God wot
when this good dronken sot
Helps not to empty the pot
For sumtime he will go
To one and to no mo
Then will the hole rout
Upon that one cry out
and say she does them wrong
To keep him all day long
From coming them among
wherefore I g^ue council
to them that good drink sell
To take in of the best
Or else they lose their gest
For he is ready and pressed
Where good ale is to rest
And drink till he be dressed
When he his book should study
He sits there full ruddy
Till half the day be gone
Crying fill the pot Ione
And will not be alone
But call sum other one
at wyndowe or at fen^stre
that is an idell ministre
as he him self is
Ye know full well this
the kind of carrion crows
ye may be sure grows
the more for carrion stinking
and so do these in drinking
this man to sum men's thinking
Does stay him much upon the king
as in the due demanding
Or that he calls an head penny
and of the paskall halpeny.
for the cloth of corpus Christy
four pens he clay mith swiftely
for which the sexton and he truly
Did tog by the ears earnestly
Saying he can not the king well pay
If all such driblars be take away
Is not this a gentill tale
Of our doctor doubble ale
Whose countenance is never pale
So well good drink he can vphale
A man of learning great
For if his brain he would beat
He could within days fourtene
make such a sermon as never was seen
I wot not whether he spoke in drink
Or drink in him how do ye think?
I never herd him preach God wot
But it were in the good ale pot
Also he says that feign he would
Come before the council if he could
For to declare his learning
And other things concerning
Goodly councels that he could give
beyond all measure ye may me believe
His learning is exceeding
ye may know by his reading
yet could a cobblers boy him tell
That he red a wrong gospel,
wherefore in deed he served him well
He turned himself as round as a bell
And with loud voice began to call
Is there no constable among you all,
to take this knave yt does me troble?
with that all was on a hubble shubble
There was drawing and dragging
There was lugging and lagging
and snitching and snatching
and ketching and catching
and so the pore ladde
To the Counter they had
Some would he should be hanged
Or else he should be wranged
Some said it were a good turn
Such an heretyke to burn
Some said this and some said that
and some did prate they wist not what
some did curse and some did ban
For chafing of our curate than
He was worthy no less
for vexing with his pertnesse
a gemman going to Mess,
Did it become a cobblers boy
To show a gemman such a toy?
but if it were well wayde
ye should find I am afraid
that the boy were worthy
for his reading and sobriety
and judgment in the verity
among honest folk to be
A curate rather then he.
for this is known for certentie
the boy does love no papistry
and our Curate is called no doubt
a papist london thoroughout.
and truth is it they do not lie,
It may be seen with half an eye.
for if there come a preacher,
Or any godly teacher
to speak against his tru^pery
to the alehouse goth he by and by*
and there he will so much drink
till of ale he does so stink,
that whether he go before or behind /
Ye shall him smell without the wind
for when he goes to it he is no hafter
He dri^keth dronke for two days after
Wi^h fill the cup Ione,
for all this is gone
Here is ale alone
I say for my drinking
tush, let the pot be clinking
and let us merry make,
No thought will I take /
for though these fellows crake
I trust to se them slake
and some of them to bake
In smithfelde at a stake
and in my Parysh be some /
that if the time come
I fear not will remember
(be it august or september
October or November
Or month of December)
to find both wood and timber
to burn them every member
and goth to board and bed
At the sign of the kings head.
And let these heretics preach
And teach what they can teach
My parish I know well
Against them will rebel
If I but once them tell
Or g^ue them any warning
That they were of the new learning.
For with a word or twain
I can them call again
And yet by the Mess
forgetful I was
Or else in a slumber
there is a shrewde number
that curstly do comber
And my patience prove
And daily me move
for some of them still
Continue will
In this new way
whatsoever I say
It is not long ago
Syns it chaunsed so
that a burial here was
Without dirige or Mass
but at the burial
they song a christmas carall
by the Mass they will mar all
If they continue shall /
Some said it was a godly hearing
(...)
Some of them fell on weping
In my church I make no leasing
They hard never the like thing
Do ye think that I will consent
to these heretics intent
to have any sacrament
Ministered in English?
by them I set not a rysh
So long as my name is hary George
I will not do it spite of their gorge.
Oh Dankester Dancastre
None between this and Lancaster.
Knows so much my mind.
As thou my special frynde
It would do the much good
To wash thy hands in the blood
Of them that hate the mess*
thou couetest no less
So much they us oppress
Pore priests doubtless
And yet what than
there is not a man
that sooner can,
Persuade his parishons
From such conditions
then I perse I
for by and by
I can them convert
to take my part
Except a few
that hacke and hew /
and against me show
What they may do
To put me to
Some hynderaunce
And ye^ may chance
The bisshops visitour,
Will show me favor
and therefore I
Care not a fly,
for often have they /
Sought by some way
To bring me to blame
and open shame /
but I will bear them out
In spite of their snout
and will not cease
To drink a pot the less
Of ale that is bygge
Nor pass not a fygge
for all their malice
away the mare quoth walis /
I set not a w^^^^ge
by all their writing,
for yet I deny not
The Masses private
Nor yet forsake
that I of a cake
My maker may make
but hark a little hark /
and a few words mark,
How this caluish clarke /
for his purpose could warke
there is an honest man:
that kept an old woman
Of alms in her bed
Liyng daily beddered
which man could not I say
with popishnes a way
but feign this woman old
would have Mess if she could
the which this priest was told
He hearing this anon
as the goodman was gone
abroad about his business
before the woman he said Mess
and showed his pretty popishnes
against the goodmans will
wherefore it is my skyll
that he should him endight
for doing such dispight
as by his popish wyle
His house with Mass defyle
Thus may ye behold
this man is very bold /
and in his learning old
Intends for to sit
I blame him not a whyt
for it would vex his wit
and clean against his earning
to follow such learning
as now a days is taught
It would sone bring to naught
His old popish brain
for then he must again
apply him to the schole
and come away a fool:
for nothing should he get
His brain has been to het
and with good ale so wet
Wherefore he may now set
In feldes and in medes
and pray upon his beads
for yet he has a pair
O^ beads that be right fair
Of coral ^gete, or ambre
at home within his chamber
tor in matins or Mass,
Primar and portas
and pottes and beads
His life he leads
But this I wota
that if ye nota
How this idiota
Does follow the pota
I hold you a grota
Ye will read by rota
that he may were a ^ota
In cock lose^s bota
thus the durty doctor
the popes own proctour
will brag and boost
with ale and a toost
and like a rutter
His latin will utter
and turn and toss him
with tu non possum
Loquere latinum
this alum finum
Is bonus then vinum
Ego volo quare
Cum tu drinkare
Pro tuum caput,
quia apud
te propiciacio
tu non potes facio
tot quam ego
quam librum tu lego,
Cave de me
apponere te
Iuro per deum
Hoc est lifum meum
quia drinkum stalum
Non sacere malum
thus our dominus dodkin
with ita vera bodkin
Does lead his life
which to the alewife
is very profitable
it is pytie he is not able
To maintain a table
For beggars and tinkers
And all lusty drinkers
Or captain or beddle
with dronkardes to meddle
ye cannot I am sure /
for keeping of a cure
find such a one well
If ye should rake hell
and therefore now
No more to you /
Sed perlegas ista,
Si velis Papista,
fare well and a dew
with a whirlary whewe
and a tirlary typpe
Beware of the whyppe.
Finis.
Take this till more come.
