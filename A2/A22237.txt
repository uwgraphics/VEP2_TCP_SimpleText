HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
By the King.
Having occasion at this time to deliberate upon diverse great and weighty
affairs highly tending to the continuance and further settling of the peaceable
government and safety of this Our Kingdom, whereof God has given Us the
charge, We have thought good, according to the laudable Custom of Our
Progenitors, to crave the advice and assistance herein of Our well affacted
Subjects, by calling a Parliament, to begin upon the sixteenth day of January
next; And though there were no more to be had in consideration, but the present
face of Christendom, so miserably and dangerously distracted at this time,
besides a number of other great and weighty affairs, that We are to resolve
upon, We have more then sufficient reason to wish and desire, (if ever at any
time, especially at this) that the Kninghts and Burgesses that shall serve in
Parliament, be, according to the old Iustitutions, chosen of the grauest,
ablest, and best affected minds that may be found. And therefore out of the
Care of the Common good, whereof themselves are also participant, We do
hereby admonish all Our loving Subjects that have votes in the Elections, that
Choice be made of persons approved for their sincerity in Religion, and not
of any, that is noted either of superstitious bl^ndnesse one way, or of
turbulent humors another way, but of such as shall be found zealous and
obedient children to this their Mother church.

And as to the Knights Shires, That they cast their eyes upon the worthiest
men, of all sorts of Knights and Gentlemen, that are Guides and Lights of
their Countries, of good experience, and great integrity, Men that lead an
honest and exemplary life in their Countries, doing Us good service therein,
and no Bankrupts or discontented Persons that cannot fish but in troubled
waters: And for the Burgesses, That they make choice of them that best
understand the State of their Countries, Cities, or Boroughes, And where such
may not be had within their Corporations, then of other grave and discreet men,
fit to serve in so worthy an Assembly. For We may well foresee, how ill
effects the bad choice of unfit men may produce, if the House should be
supplied with Bankrupts and necessitous persons that may desire long
Parliaments for their private protections, Or with young and unexperienced men
that are not ripe and mature for so grave a Council, Or With men of mean
qualities in themselves, who may only serve applaud the opinion of others on
whom they depend, Or yet with curious and wrangling Lawyers, who may seek
reputation by stirring needless questions: But We wish all Our good Subjects
so to understand these Our admonitions, as that We no way mean to bar them
of their lawful freedom in election, according to the fundamental laws and
laudable custom of this Our Kingdom, and especially in the times of good and
settled government.

Given at Our Court at Theobaldes the sixth day of November, in the eighteenth
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

most Excellent Majesty. 1620.
