A true COPY of Mr. Roger Altham's Recantation, for Licensing Mr. Hill's Book
against the Bishop of Salisbury.
WHereas I Roger Altham did License a Book, Entitled A Vindication of the
Primitive Fathers, etc. written by Mr. Samuel Hill of Killington, in the
Diocese of Bath and Wells, etc. in which are contained many Scurrilous
Reflections upon, and malicious Insinuations of Heresy, and secret Practice
against the R. R. F. in God Gilbert, Lord Bishop of Sarum, whereby his
Lordship's Honor and Sacred Function are much Blackened and Calumniated. I the
said Roger Altham do profess my self entirely sorrowful for being the Occasion;
by granting the said License, of making public the said Reflections, and
malicious Insinuations, and do humbly, and with all Submission acknowledge my
Offense therein, and crave his Lordship's pardon and forgiveness therefore: And
further, beg his Lordship's Intercession with the Honorable, and Right R. F.
in God Henry, Lord Bishop of London, whose Displeasure I have hereby justly
incurred.

April the 2d. 1695. Roger Altham.
Signed in the presence of us,

This was read in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury 's Grace, the L.
