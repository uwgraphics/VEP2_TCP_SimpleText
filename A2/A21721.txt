A Proclamation set forth by Therle of Susses, the Queens Majesty's
Lieuetenaunt general in the North, declaring truly the falsebodes and vain
delusions vvherby Therles of Northumberlande and VVes^mer^a^de, and their
confederate^, do abuse the Queens Majesty's subjects, to mayntayn^ their
rebellious enterprises, the.xxviii. of No^ember 1569.
WHere Cherles of Northumberlande and Westmerlande, with their confederates
have most undutifully and unnaturally conspired to levy war against their
and our most gracious sovereign Lady the Queens Majesty, and thereupon have
entered into open and actual rebellion, and to cover their wicked and
detestable attemptes, have abused and deluded many of her Majesty's subjects
in these parts, sometimes commanding them in her highness name to repair to
them in warlike manner for the defense and surety of her Majesty's person, when
their intent of calling them was in deed to maintain their horrible treasons,
and thereby to put in peril her most royal person, whom God long preserve,
sometimes affirming their do^nges to be with thaduise and consent of the
nobility of this Realm, who in deed be wholly bent (as manifestly does
appear) to spend their lives in dutiful obedience against them and all other
traitors, sometimes pretending for conscience sake to seek to refourme
religion, where in deed it is manifestly known many of them never had care of
conscience, or ever respected any religion, but continued a dis^olute life,
until at this present they were driven to pretend a popish holiness, to put
some false color upon their manifest treasons, directly against the
commandment of God in holy scripture, the laws of this Realm, and the
ancient prerogative of the imperial crown of England, sometimes declaring
that they be driven to take this matter in hand, left otherwise foreign
princes might take it upon them, to the great peril of this Realm: where in
deed they not contented with the good quiet and public administration of
justice, so long continued under the Queens Majesty, as the like was never
before in any princes time, have by all the wicked means they could, practiced
with forrayne princes to aid them in this wicked enterprise, and thereby
sought not only the manifest pe^^^^ of our most gracious sovereign (...), but
also to bring the whole Realm to perpetual thraldom and misery, under the
subjection and slavery of forrayne powers and potentates, hoping thereby to
satisfy some part of their licentious and dissolute minds, and sometimes
covering their naughty intentes with a show of desire to preserve the state
of the ancient nobility from destruction, prepared (as they say) against
them: where in deed it manifestly appears, that in whole twelve years past
the Queens Majesty has had such care of the preserving of that state, as
from the beginning of her reign to this hour there has not perished one of
that flock, and they them selves who abuse the people with these slanderous
devises, have most graciously and liberally tasted of her Majesty's favor,
good countenance, bounty, and familier usage, more then others did of their
equalles, and far above their deserts, and of whom her Majesty had
conceived so good opinion, as hardly could she of long time be induced to
think that either such lack of duty could enter into their hearts against
their sovereign, or such ingratitude against her that had so liberally dealt
with them, and so lovingly used them, although she manifestly knew that some
of them lived in danger of her laws, whereof she gave them to understand she
had good knowledge, and did tolerate with them in hope of their loyalties
otherwa^es.

In consideration whereof, we ^ho^as ^a^^e of Sussex, her Majesty's Lieutenaunt
general in the north parts, seeing how the ignora^^t people be abused by
these delusions, and knowing what constaunt promises, assertions, and oaths
they have heretofore made by their own mouths to the Queens Majesty, as
also of late by her Majesty's direction to us to be reported to her highness
for the continuounce of their truethes a loyalties to her Majesty: and seeing
by the sequel that all which heretofore they have done, or presently do, or
hereafter intend to do, be but fore pretended falshodes, to delude all states*
degrees, and persons to serve their wicked purposes: have thought it convenient
hereby to notify to al her Majesty's subjects their manner of dealinges*
whereby they may manifestly see, that their principal intentes be to put in
peril the person of our most gracious sovereign, whom God long preserve, to
sow sedition and rebellion by all the false means they may, to do their
uttermost to put her Majesty in danger of her most lawful royal crown and
dignity, to draw foreyne nations into this Realm, to the utter subuertion
and perpetual bondage of this ancient free common wealth, to spoil al kind
of people, whereof the whose country feels the present smart, and to
mainteyne and continue their li^^ (...) to abuse all kind of states, for the
furthering of their wicked intentes, and prolonging of their detestable
doings, which God of his justice can not long^u^^er to continue.

Ill which matters evidently appearing to the whole world, be sufficient to
induce all men that have either reason, duty to their sovereign Lady, or
love to their native country, and have been by these delusions abused, utterly
to forsake and detest them and their wicked doings, and al such as have not
hitherto ben abused to forbear to repair to them, or any ways to aid or
succor them or any of theirs in these traitorous enterprises, abominable
before God, undutiful to their sovereign Lady, and most perilous to the quiet
and prosperous state of this Realm, wherein all honest persons have lived from
the beginning of her Majesty's reign in freedom of their persons, with
suertie of life, lands, and goods, which God long continue.

T. Sussex.

God save the Queen.
