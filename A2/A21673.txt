By the Queen.
THe Queen's Majesty understands, that where she has given order, that all
her loving subjects to whom she owes any money upon lone, should be fully
and spedyly paid: certain persons intendyng unduly to seek a gain herein,
have of late sought to redeem into their hands, a number of privy Seals,
which were delivered to the said creditours for assurance of repayment, with
condition to pay to them less portions, then ought and shall be paid by her
Majesty to the said creditours. Which abuse, her Majesty so much misliketh,
as a thing tendyng in some part to the discredit of her payment, and insome
other, to damnifie such persons, as her Majesty thinks worthy, not only of
their money, but of her thanks: that her express commandment and will is,
that if any person may any wise be known, that may be herewith charged, the
party so offendyng, shall not only make full payment to the creditours, but
shall be further punished, until he have made satisfaction for his offense,
against the honor and credit of her Majesty.

Yeuen at S. James the xi. day of November, the sixth year of her Majesty's
reign. God save the Queen.
