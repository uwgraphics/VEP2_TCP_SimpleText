ODE Sancti GEORGII
Die Decantata, Aprilis 23. 1686.
1.
VIRI sub utroque Globo,
Terrae and cujuscunque Gentes
Concordes elevate mentes,
Et Gratulemini JACOBO.
Priorem Quo, non habet Mundus,
Honorum Primus Hic est fundus,
JACOBVS Nomine Secundus.
2.
Gaudete Reges Foederati!
Tuba Sonet, ac Tormentum,
Et omne fiat Argumentum
In Laudem Regis Coronati.
3.
Gallus gaudeat, ac Iberus;
Danus, and Polona Pubes:
Tristitiae serenent nubes
Nobilitas, Anglusque Clerus.
4.
Hibernus indies accrescat,
Et quum Temperabit Lyram
Scotus Leo leniat Iram,
Carduusque Rosa coalescat.
5.
Thamesi concurrit Tiber,
Europae Magnae Mercatorum
Londinum stat commune Forum,
Sit homo Verna, sive Liber.
6.
Olyssiponae Lusitanus
Libere nobiscum misceat
Cor, ac Merces quales liceat,
Et Regis Osculetur Manus.
7.
Quid ambigitis Batavi?
Calamitas vos quoties urget,
Sospitator Is assurget
Cui Patris Os, and Men's est Avi.
8.
Tanti est, noster Imperator;
Princeps oculatae Mentis,
Martis Terror, ac Tridentis
Terra, and Mari Triumphator.
9.
Cives Portas aperite,
Vestrum and salutate Regem,
Qui Musas and tuetur Legem,
Grantae Praes, and Bellositae.
10.
Dies Iste Gloriosus;
Hispania Fontes vina fundant;
Dum Rubro Latices redundant,
Sit nemo Moestus, aut Morosus.
11.
Angliae sudum raro certius,
Aut Serenum sic affulsit,
Musica tam nos demulsit
Vicessimus Aprilis Tertius.
12.
GEORGIUS heic JACOBO junctus;
Ambo Genii Tutelares
Angliae defendunt Lares;
Georgius olim fato functus,
Et Praesens DEI Princeps VNCTVS.
13.
Unanimes Britanni State,
Boreae Sidus, and Occiduum,
State Corpus Individuum,
Et Laudem DEO Jubilate.
Hic Hic est cui succumbet Mundus,
Per Quem JACOBVS Fons, and Fundus
Honorum, nulli stat Secundus.
The Song sung on St. George's Day, etc.
1.
LET every Kingdom, Camp and Court,
Whose Natives to this Realm resort,
Congratulate That Prince, whose Name's
(As His Blessed Grandsire's was) King JAMES;
Second by Name, but in the Throne,
And Orb of Honor, shines Alone,
And There sits Second unto None.
2.
Let all Confederate Kings and Powers,
Whose Kingdoms are at Peace with Ours,
Rejoice; Whilst Trumps and Cannons Ring,
The Loud Elogiums of Our KING.
3.
Let France and Spain disband all Fears;
With Denmarks, and great Polands Peers;
Whilst Nobles, with the Clergy, clear
All Clouds arising in Our Sphere.
4.
When Ireland Tunes his Charming Lyre,
Stout Scotland's Lion does retire,
And her Pungent Thistles close
In Union with our English Rose.
5.
Thames and Tiber both Combine;
And Londons made the Magazine
Of Merchandise; in each Degree,
Where Men do meet, both Bond, and Free.
6.
Lisbond's Rich, and Royal Pile,
Freely Traffiques with Our Isle
In most Commodities of the Land;
And Joys to Kiss Our Sovereign's Hand.
7.
Belgia then no more distrust
A Prince, whose Prudence can Adjust
All Diff'rences, in whom you will find
His Father's Face, and Grandsire's Mind.
8.
So Qualified is He to Reign,
Whose Active Body, and Strong Brain,
Puts Mars and Neptune to the stand,
He Riding Lord by Sea and Land.
9.
Ye Citizens, set wide Your Gates
To Him who is the THREE ESTATES
Sole Prop; A Prince of Deep Discerning,
Pillar both of Law and Learning.
10.
This is a Day of Jubilee;
Let all be Debonair, and free
To Quaff what London's Conduits carry,
Burdeux Wine, or Old Canary.
11.
Music never was better heard
On such an April's Twenty Third,
Than This, where Air and Earth conspire
In Consort to make up the Quire.
12.
For GEORGE and JAMES Our Tutelary
Guardians, jointly keep and carry
A Correspondence, GEORGE Translated
Long since to Bliss, and there Instated;
And JAMES by Heaven's Decree appointed
Britain's Ruler, GOD's ANOINTED.
13.
To Him let Britain's North and South,
Give Praise with Mutual Heart and Mouth,
And cleave in Love and true Communion
To Him, who is the GOD of Union.
It Is HE, It Is HE that can alone
Guard and support Great JAMES his Throne,
Who sits here SECOND unto None.
Cantilenam Concludamus cum Authoris Action Gratiarum post Prandium.
GRates DEO Tibi damus
Pro Donis Vestris; and oramus
Ut Rex JACOBUS diu vigeat,
Nec Britannus Orbs indigeat
Rege Nato de JACOBIS,
Donec adsit SHILO Nobis. Amen.
We will conclude this Gratulatory ODE with the Author's Usual Grace after
Dinner.
LORD, Give us humble and right thankful Hearts
For all the Blessings which thy Love Imparts:
And-Bless our Sacred Sovereign King JAMES,
Who of His Royal Line, and Christian Name's
Fourth Monarch of Great Britain; Scotlands Seventh,
King of both Realms the Hundred and Eleventh:
LORD Grant that from His Seed there never want One
Till SHILO come, to sit upon the Throne. Amen.
FINIS.
