A Proclamation concerning Tobacco.
WHereas in the Reign of Our late dear Father, and since Our access to the
Crown, upon mature deliberation three have been sundry Proclamations published
for restraining the landing of Tobacco to certain Ports and Harbors within
this Kingdom, and against planting of the same within this Realm; And for
that they have not been put in due execution, diverse frauds and abuses have
been of late invented and put in execution, by mixing of Tobacco, not only
with other Tobacco of worse condition, but also with other Materials,
falsifying and corrupting the same, to the great hurt and damage of Our people,
both in their estates and persons, which growing evil may in some measure be
prevented, if the Tobacco brought into this Our Realm shall be laid or landed
only in one Port and place.

For remedy therefore in that behalf, and to the end We may be the more
truly answered of the Custom, Impost, and other duties due unto Us for
Tobacco brought into this Realm by way of Merchandise, whereof We have been
sundry times defrauded by landing the same at the pleasures of the Owners: We
do hereby publish and declare Our Royal will and pleasure, That no Tobacco
be hereafter landed, or imported to be landed at any other Port, then in Our
Port of London, and at no other place of the said Port then at the Key and
Wharfe commonly called the Custom House Key, situate in Our City of London,
and other Port or place for landing of Tobacco We do not admit or allow, but
them inhibite.

And We do hereby straightly charge and command all and singular Customers,
Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters and other Officers, attending in all Our
Ports, Creekes, or places of lading or vnlading, (except Our said Port of
London) not to take entries of any Tobacco, nor suffer the same to be taken,
landed, or laid on shore in any other Harbor, Port, Creek or place within
this Kingdom, upon pain that every of the said Officers that shall be found
negligent, corrupt or remiss herein, shall undergo such pains and penalties,
as by the Laws or Censure of our Court of Star Chamber may be inflicted
upon them for the same.

And it is Our further will and pleasure, that if any Ship or Barque wherein
Tobacco shall be laden shall arrive at any other Port or place then at Our
said Port of London.

We do hereby give full power and Authority to all and every the Customers,
Comptrollers, Surueyours, Searchers and Waiters, and every of them there
attending, and do command them to take and arrest the same Tobacco, and
forthwith to make Certificate to the Customers of the Port of London, of the
Owners name of such Ship or other Uessell, and his place of dwelling, the
number and names of the Officers, and Mariners in the same, the place from
whence the same Tobacco came, with the quantity of Tobacco that shall be
contained therein.

And also, that Our said Officers, or some of them, shall with all convenient
speed cause and procure the Tobacco so by them arrested, to be carefully
transmitted to the said Port of London, to the Customer there, that the same
may be there viewed, and the duties thereof belonging unto Us, may be duly
paid and satisfied, and such further order taken with the same, and with the
Owners thereof, as shall be fit.

And whereas notwithstanding former Proclamations published to the contrary,
yet We are informed, that Tobacco is still planted and sown in diverse parts
of Our Realms of England and Ireland, in contempt of Us and Our Royal
Commands declared to the contrary; We do therefore hereby again absolutely
prohibit the Planting thereof in Our said Kingdoms, as also the bringing into
the same of any Seed for the increase thereof, from the parts beyond the Seas;
The Tobacco growing in the Northern and moist Climats being not only
unwholesome for man's body, but the same makes fertile grounds become for a
long space less fruitful, that might otherwise produce Corn, Herbs and
Roots for the sustenance of Our Subjects.

And for the more certain depressing of the same, We do hereby straightly
command Our Justices of Assize within their several Circuits, Our Justices of
Peace within Our several Counties of this Kingdom, Majors, Sheriffs,
Bayliffes, and other Our Officers within each City and Town Corporate, that
they at their several Sittings, Quarter Sessions, and meetings, give the same
in charge as an Offense, whereof We expect due reformation, requiring a
Return thereof amongst other the grieuances of the Country in their
Presentiments, And the names and dwelling places of any Offenders herein, and
the qualities of their Offenses, to present to the Lords of Our Privy Council,
the then next Term after every such Sitting or meeting, to the end the
Offenders may be proceeded against by sentence in Our Court of Star Chamber,
or otherwise, as in justice shall be thought fit.

And lastly, We do by these Presents will and require all and singular Majors,
Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughes, Customers,
Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, and all other Our Officers and Ministers
whatsoever, that they and every of them in their several places and Offices,
be diligent and attendant in the execution of this Our Proclamation, as they
will answer the contrary at their uttermost perils.

Given at Our Court at Greenewich, this nineteenth day of May, in the tenth
year of Our Reign of England, Scotland, France and Ireland. God save the King.
Imprinted at London by ROBERT BARKER, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
MAJESTY: And by the Assigns of JOHN BILL. 1634.
