By the King. A Proclamation for restoring the ancient Merchants Adventurers to
their former Trade and Privileges.
WHereas heretofore We declared Our desires to have brought to pass as a
principal work of Our times, the Manufactures of Dying and Dressing of
Broad-cloath within this Realm, and to that end did publish Our several
Proclamations, the one 23. Iulij Anno 12. of Our Reign, the other 2. Decembr.
following, for the encouragement of such of Our Subjects as then undertook to
set up and manage the said Trade; But finding that time discovers many
inhabilities, which cannot at first be seen, and being willing to have it
known to all Our loving Subjects, that We intend not to insist and stay longer
upon specious and fair shows, which produce not the fruit Our actions do
ever aim at, which is the general good of this Our State and Kingdom:
Wherefore perceiving that the former grounds proposed to Us, by the Undertakers
of that work, consisted more in hopes then in effects; and finding the work
it self to be too great to be brought to pass in any short time, by reason
of the many difficulties accompanying the same, and that as the State of Trade
now stands, there will be greater loss in the Cloth-making of the Kingdom,
then gain in the Dying and Dressing thereof, which We may not suffer, the
commodity of Broad-cloth being one of the principal Dowries of this Our
State, and which has brought great wealth and honor to the same; And having
the experience of many ages to ground Our selves upon, that the ancient Company
of the Merchants Adventurers have ever managed their Trade, as with profit to
the Common wealth, so with much praise to their Company, in taking off and
venting the Clothes of this Kingdom, whereby they deserve both grace and
encouragement from Us. Therefore no longer to withdraw Our countenance from
them, but to quicken and give a new life unto them, We do hereby signify and
declare, that We have already restored and given back unto them, all and every
their Charters, any wise touching their Incorporation, form of government, and
Trade, or any Powers, Licenses, Authorities, or privileges concerning the
same; And them have and do hereby settle and redintigrate in their former
estate and degree to all purposes: Willing it to be known that none of the
Charters of the said Company, were ever by Us annihilated, or by Law avoided,
but only suspended and sequestered, till our further pleasure known. And
therefore we do by these presents declare, constitute, and ordain, That the
said Company of the Merchants Adventurers shall and may from henceforth
practice, and put in execution all and every their Powers, Licenses,
Authorities, Privileges and form of government contained in all or any their
Charters; and all vsages, holding of Courts, meetings, assemblies, and all
other proceedings by virtue of them or any of them, together with all the
dependances, either in the parts beyond the Seas, or here within the Kingdom.

And further, We do hereby intimate and declare, letting it to be known to
all foreign Princes, and States, in whose Dominions, the said Merchants
Adventurers now have, or hereafter shall have any recourse in the exercise of
their Trade: That (notwithstanding any former signification of Our pleasure
otherwise) We have again fully, and really enabled them to maintain, hold,
possess, and enjoy all and every their former Immunities, Rights, Powers, and
Privileges in any foreign parts beyond the Seas, with free liberty and power
as heretofore, to deal, contract, and agree with any Prince, State, or City in
Germany, or the Low Countries, for and touching any further, or other
privileges to be had and obtained in those parts touching their Trade: Hereby
giving, granting, and allowing, unto the said Merchants Adventurers, from time
to time, free liberty and choice to make and appoint such and so many places of
their residence in foreign parts, as to them shall seem convenient; And those
at their pleasure to change and remove, as shall and may stand best with their
commodity and profit. And, that the said Merchants Adventurers, may
henceforth go on and exercise their said Trade, with better confidence and
encouragement, which is best effected by removing and discharging all
impediments: We do by these presents straightly prohibit, forbid, constitute,
and ordain, That from henceforth no Interloper, nor other person or persons,
not free of the said Company, presume in any wise to meddle, or intromit
directly, or indirectly in the Trade, or Privileges of the said Company, upon
pain of Our high Indignation, and such other pains, and penalties, as by the
Charters of the said Company, or any of them are or shall be provided for
transgres^rs in that kind. Which that it may have the better effect, We do
hereby straightly charge and command all Majors, Shiriffes, Bailiffs,
Constables; especially all Customers and Searchers, and other Officers of Our
Customs, as well in the Port of London, as in all other Ports of this Kingdom;
That they be aiding and assisting to the said Company, and the Officers thereof
in the execution of their said Charters, and that they nor any of them in their
several places, pass out any goods or Merchandises into any the parts of
Germany, or the Low Countries, nor into any other parts beyond the Seas, where
the said Company now have, or hereafter shall have any privileges granted unto
them contrary to the true meaning of their said Charters, upon pain of Our
displeasure, and the loss of his or their Offices that shall offend therein.

Given at Our Court at Ashton the 12. of August in the fifteenth year of Our
Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the one and fiftieth.
God save the King.
