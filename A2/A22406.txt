A Proclamation for Fee Dear.
WHereas We are informed, that there are sundry, that under pretense of their
Offices, do challenge to have Fee Dear, both in Summer and Winter, out of Our
Forests, Chaces, and Parkes, and upon that pretext, not grounded in Law, they
send their Warrants, as if Dear were due to them: For that We are satisfied by
Our learned Counsel, and otherwise, that there is no such right belonging to
any Subject, but only to Our two Justices of Oyer and Terminer of Our Forests,
the one on this side Trent, and the other beyond; Therefore We do straightly
charge and command, as well, that no person do presume to send any Warrant unto
any Our Forests, Chaces, and Parkes, upon pretense of any such right, as also
all Wardens, Lieuetenants, or other Officers of Our Forests, Chaces, and
Parkes, that they serve no Warrants of any, but only of Our said Justices of
Our Forests, Chaces, and Parkes, and of such as have right by being
Lieutenants, or other principal Officers of the Forests, which of right have
it by the allowance of the Justices of Our Forests, according to the Law of
the Forest; And if any shall either send or serve, contrary to this Our
Declaration of Our Pleasure, We shall, as We have cause, make them feel Our
displeasure.

Given at Our Palace of White Hall, the 26. of May, in the second year of Our
Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by Bonham Norton and John Bill, Printers to the Kings most
Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXVI.
