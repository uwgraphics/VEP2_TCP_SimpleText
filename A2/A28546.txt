BOETHIUS De CONSOLATIONE, ANGLO-LATINE, Expressus,

Per S. E. M.

LONDINI Excusum, 1654.

TO THE RIGHT HONORABLE THOMAS, Earl of SOUTHAMPTON, my very Learned and Noble
friend, and Allye.
My Lord,
IT were reason enough for a Dedication that I had known your Lordship in your
tender years; for whosoever has known you at any time, must needs honor and
love you, but he that inwardly now knows you (as I do) must honor and
admire you; and I have so many Titles to make me honor you, that I have the
greatest reason in the world to Dedicate my whole self unto you.

Be pleased to accept this piece, first, of my Boethius, whom I by many reasons
may call mine, having studied him at least these forty years, and used at many
means and helps of Commentators and Interpreters as I could get, to make him
wholly mine. At last, I found mine own Genius made me the best Interpreter of
him, which work I now Dedicate to you, that if you please, my Lord, under your
name to let it come to public view, it may, if not, it may rest in silence.

I once saw and perused a translation of it into English, a very good one,
Dedicated to my Lady your Mother, in manuscript. I wish I might come to the
view of that again; it is at least thirty years since I saw that: I have now
sent your Lordship to peruse a good Translation of him in English Print, signed
with G. G. but no more of his name can I learn, or whether be be dead or
alive; but I dare swear it was not GEORGE GARRARD, whether he be so learned
or no, I know not, but for all his modesty if it had been his, the world
should have taken more notice of his name, who published himself GEORGE
GARRARD the Bowler.

My work shall have the signatures of S. E. according to the fashion of the
Innes of Court which are the best Courts now.

HENRY Earl of SOUTHAMPTON your renowned father, tam Mar quam Mercurio, was
of Lincolns Inn, and has left in that Chapel an everlasting monument of his
beneficence and Piety: the whole Roof was his Timber, such is not now to be
had for a hundred pound. FRANCIS Earl of RUTLAND, FRANCIS Earl of BEDFORD,
FRANCIS Earl of WESTMORLAND, JOHN Earl of BRIDGEVVATER, and his father
ELLESMERE, who by his study there became great Chancellor: and was for two
days together Lord high STEWARD of England. GEORGE Earl of RUTLAND, and I
believe JOHN now Earl of RUTLAND, FRANCIS Earl of CHICHESTER; your late
father in law, was of Lincolnes Inn in my time, and his brother Mr. ROBERT
LEIGH. The Lord VISCOUNT CRAMOND betetr known by the name Lord RICHARDSON, the
first of them by his study there raised himself and family. The Lord MARQVES
DORCHESTER, is now of Grayes Inn, a very learned Gentleman: and his Brother
PIERPOINT is of Lincolnes Inn now also, a very learned Gentleman. And I, quoth
the dog, may come in the reere of the Nobility to make one, who have been a
Dunce there, because I never gate money by the Law, ever since 1612. now forty
two years. I had almost forgotten my Brother Dunce, who neither got any money
by the Law, but he danced not there long Sir BEAVCHAMP Saint JOHN'S, we were
admitted both in oue night. All these were of Lincolns Inn, Sir HENRY COMPTON
also, and some more that I cannot now remember, and multitudes of other Inns of
Court. But these are enough to make that Position good, there are now no such
Courts in any place of England.

Yet I hope to make them more glorious when they are made Academies of Music,
and all the Music of the world shall be made English. A work I have now in
hand, and find it very fezible, I have made some progress in it. Then I hope
my friends will not pronounce me an absolute Dunce in all things, though
neither by this do I intend to get money. I am in Love with God and goodness
and not with Mammon. Pereat Pecunia, male par^a cum coacervatore ejus. Ergo
Auguris votum teneo. Nec paupertatem nec divitias, ne in des pectum aut
contemptum veniam ex pauperte, nec in superbiam and obliviscentiam Dei per
accumulatas divitias.

This is enough if not too much for an Epistle; so now I take the boldness to
kiss your hands my Lord for a farewell, who have been long in kissing them by
this Epistle. And I remain

My Lord Devoted to your farther service S. E. M.

LIB. I.
COllectarium primi Libri, compendiosa succinctaque resumptio dictorum in
libros Boethii de Consolatione Philosophiae.

The gatherings of the first Book, being a compendious and succinct assumption
of those things which are said in the Books of Boethius.

The first Book has seven Meeters, and six Proses. In the first Meeter
Boethius bewailes his misery, from the change of his Study, and in part from
the decay of his body, and in part from the prolonging of his miserable life,
speaks by Apostrophe against his friends.

Primus liber habet 7. Metra, and 6. Prosus. In Metro primo deplangit statum
suae miseriae ex part permutationis studii and ex part defectus corporalis,
and ex part prolongationis suae miserabilis vitae Apost^ophando contra amicos.

In Prosa prima introducit Philosophiam se super sua miseria consolantem, and
describit dispositiones and proprietates ejus, vestesque tenues, quas practica
and theoretica intertexta perornavit.

In the first Prose he brings Philosophy comforting him against his miseries,
and describes the disposition and properties of her garments, which were thin,
which the Practical and Theorick had interwoven and adorned her with.

In Metro 2. Philosophia deplangit perturbationem mentis hominis convertendo se
specialiter super Boethium.

In the second Meeter, Philosophy bewails the perturbation of the mind of man,
turns her self especially to Boethius

In prosa 2. Philosophia investigat morbum ex quibusdam signis consolando ipsum
ne despereat.

In the second Prose Philosophy finds out the disease from some signs
comfort him lest he should despair.

In Metro 3. Boethius declarat per quibusdam sese quomodo remotis impedimentis
recuperat vigorem.

In the third Meeter Boethius declares by certain things how he, the
impediments removed, may recover his vigor.

In Prosa 3. ostendit quomodo Philosophiam agnoverit and qualiter de praesentia
ejus admirari caepit, and quomodo sapienti persecutio a vulgaribus non est
nova, sed cunctis praestantissimis viris communis.

In the third Prose he shows how he knew Philosophy, and how he admired her
presence, and how persecution is a common thing from the vulgar, to the wisest
and best men.

In Metro 4 Philosophia ostendit qualiter hoc de se habet ut persecutiones
improbi non praevalent contra ipsum exclamando cunctos qui timent tyrannos,
sibi nectunt catenam, qua trahantur.

In the fourth Meeter Philosophy shows how he has it from her, that the
persecutions of wicked men may not prevail, ex^^aimeth against him, that all
that fear tyrants, knit a chain for themselves by which they are drawn.

In 4. Prosa Philosophia requirit Boethium super attentione pradictorum, and
hortatur ipsum ad sui morbi tractationem. Et Boethius revelat mo^bum suum
respondens se turbari ut his quae injuriose fiebant contra ipsum ex sui in
exilium r^legatione and meriti sui frustratione ex injust^s sui condemnatione
ex fame sui lasione, and tandem ex his quo^ videbat generaliter injuriosa aliis
infer, and haec omnia fibi evenisse propter studia ipsius.

In the fourth Prose Philosophy requires of Boethius upon his attention to
those things have been said, and exhorts him to the handling of his own
disease. And Boethius reveals his disease, answers that he was troubled, that
these things were done injuriously against him from the time of his banishment,
and the frustration of the reward of his merits, from his unjust condemnation,
and hurt of his fame: and at length out of these which he saw generally
injurious things were cast upon others: and all these came upon him by reason
of his study in Philosophy.

In Metro 5. Boethius exclamat contra providentiam divinam, admittens quod
omnia reguntur a Deo praeter actus humanas: sed si homo similis sit, cum
turbato Boethio haec videbatur imo rogat Deum ut regeret actus hominum ne sit
perversi praevalerent adversus bonos impune.

In the fifth Meeter Boethius exclaims against the providence of God, admiting
that all things are governd by God but humane actions: but if man be lighter
troubled to Boethius these things seemed sore, but he entreats God that he
would govern humane actions, that the perverse should not s^ prevail without
punishment against good men.

In Prosa 5. ostendit quomodo Philosophia se habuit ad suam quaerimoniam, and
quid ex ea cognovit, recolligit sub brevitate ea quae Boethium perturbaverant,
dicens modum remedii ipsum Boethium.

In the fifth Prose he shows how Philosophy behaved her self toward his
complaint, and what she gathered out of that, and she briefly recollects what
troubled Boethius, saying that the means of remedy was Boethius himself.

In Metro 6. Philosophia probat in omnibus ordinem esse servandum, and facit
hoc tribus exemplis.

In the sixth Meeter Philosophy proves, that in all things order is to be
observed, and does this by 3. ex^mples.

In Prosa 6. and ultima, inquirit cansam radicalem infirmitatis Boethii, and de
circumstantiis gubernatoris mundi, and de principio and fine rerum, colligendo
omnes infirmitates Boethii omnes tum esse curabiles, and dicit Philosophia sibi
primo velle proponere remedia levia, praeterea gravia reservare donce melius
conval^scat and roboretur.

In the sixth Prose and the last, she enquires the radical cause of Boethius
his infirmity, and of the circumstances of the governor of the world, and of
the beginning and end of things, collecting all the infirmities of Boethius,
and that all of them are curable, and Philosophy says, that she would first
propose to her self slight remedies, and afterward reserve the greater till
he were better recovered and strengthened.

In Metro 7 and ultima, Philosophia probat per exempla quod caligo
perturbationum impedit mentis intuitum, hortando ad fugam eorum quae catenant
animam scilicet gaudium amorem, and spem, and dolorem, and se abjiciendo
nonnunquam potest men's talibus perpedita Philosophari.

In the seventh and last Meeter, Philosophy proves by examples, that darkness
of perturbations is an impediment to the eye of the mind, exhorting us to the
abandoning of them seeing they enslave the soul, to wit, by casting away joy,
fear, hope, and grief; for it was impossible for the soul to convert it
self to the study of Philosophy, when it was taken up with passions of this
nature.

LIB. II.
2. Liber habet 8. Prosus, and 8. Metra. In Prosa 1. ostendit Boethius quid
Philosophia fecit post praedictam. Et Philosophia resumit unam causam doloris
Boethii, i. e. de fortuna omnibus mirabilem effectum fortunae, excusans se de
resumptione preterita faelicitatis Boethii: omnem opportunitatem medendi
Boethium, and procedit ad medicamenta.

The second Book contains eight Proses, and eight Meeters. In the first Prose
Boethius shows what Philosophy did after which she had laid out before. And
Philosophy resumeth one cause of the grief of Boethius; to wit, concerning
fortune discovering the admirable effect of fortune, excusing her self
concerning the resumption of the past felicity of Boethius: and likewise
shows the opportunity of curing Boethius, and proceeds to the Medicines.

In Metro 1. Philosophia describit mores fortuna, viz. quod more rotae semper
alternat se.

In the 1. Meteor Philosophy describes the conditions of fortune, to wit, that
she turns her self in manner of a wheel.

In Prosa 2. Philosophia in troducit fortunam ostendentem non esse dolendum de
ea.

In the 2. Prose, Philosophy brings in fortune showing, that men ought not to
be grieved for her.

In Metro 2. conqueritur de inexpleta cupiditate hominum.

In the 2. Meeter, she complains of the unsatisfied covetousness of men.

In Prosa 3. ostendit quod fortuna multa bona Boethio contulit in enumerando
ipsa bona praeterita por ordinem.

In the 3. Prose she shows, that fortune has conferd many good things upon
Boethius, in declaring these good things in just order.

In Metro 3. Philosophia determinat ex tribus exemptis mutabilitatem mundanorum.

In the 3. Meeter Philosophy determines from 3. examples, the mutability of
worldly things.

In Prosa 4. Philosophia ostendit quomodo Boethius adhuc multa habuit bona
fortunae ex part Symachi soceri sui and ex part pudicae conjugis, and ex
part filiorum, and ex his consolatur cum ostendens faelicitatem temporalem
nulli posse totaliter evenire, and de quanto aliquis est faelicior tanto
leviori adversitat^ prosternitur; and ex hoc concludit falicitatem fortuitum
miseram and amaram, and quod in rebus fortuitis non possit consistere vera
felicitas quod etiam mors cunctis debetur.

In the 4. Prose Philosophy shows, how Boethius had yet many of fortunes good
things, from the part of Symachus his father in Law, and from the part of his
modest wife, and from the part of his children, and from these she comforts
him, showing that temporal felicity can totally happen to no man, and by how
much a man is happier, by so much he is cast down by lighter adversity, and
from this she concludes, that the chance of felicity is miserable and bitter,
and that in casual things it cannot consist, because death is due to every one.

In Metro 4. Philosophia commendat viam mediocrem per similitudinemae lificii
mediocriter situati.

In the 4 Meeter Philosophy commends a mean life, by the similitude of a
building situate in a middle place.

In Prosa 5. ponit remedia pauciora quod fortuna non sit summopere expetenda,
ostendens ignobilitatem divitiarum gemmarum agrorum vestium clientium
incomparatione ad hominem, and quod homines praedicta nimium diligentes faciunt
injuriam suo conditori.

In the 5. Prose she sets down fewer remedies, that fortune is not with too
much labor to be sought, showing the ignoblenesse of riches, jewels, lands,
garments, clients, in comparison to man, and that men too much loving the
foresaid things, do injury to their maker.

In Metro 5 Philosophia commendat antiquam aetatem quae multa pace and
sobrietate florebat.

In the 5. Meeter, Philosophy commends ancient age which flourished with much
peace and sobriety.

In Prosa 6. Philosophia ostendit quod dignitates and potestates non sunt
magnopere appetendae quia adveniunt malis and solum possunt corpus; scilicet
divitiae, vanescunt and periculosa.

In the 6. Prose, Philosophy shows that dignities and powers are not very much
to be desired, because they fall to the lot of the wicked, and only can bless
the body, to wit, vain riches they are and dangerous.

In Metro 6. ostendit nequitiam potentis Neronis qui ideo infamis factus fuit,
quia imperator (...).

In the 6. Meeter, she shows the wickedness of the mighty Nero, who
therefore was made infamous because he was Emperor.

In prosa 7. Philosophia ostendit quod gloria etiam just acquisita non est
appetenda, quia mundo est strictus, and gentes sunt multae and quod una gens
laudat alia damnat, and quia etiam gloria non peraurat, and quod notanter
virtuosi non debent quaerere gloriam. Primo pertinet ad levitaetem arrogantia,
2. quod nihil spectat ad animam quae immortalis est and deformis.

In the 7. Prose Philosophy shows, that glory though justly gotten, is not to
be desired, because the world is narrow, and the nations are many, and that
which one commends another condemns, and because glory also is not lasting. And
because by name the virtuous ought not to seek glory, first, because it
pertains to the levity of arrogance: secondly, because it belongs nothing to
the soul which is immortal and without shape.

In Metro 7. Philosophia probat gloriam non esse quaerendam quod caelum latum
est and terra strictissima; and addueit viros illustros quorum gloria periit,
nisi hoc solum quod a pauoulis literis nominatur.

In the 7. Meeter Philosophy proves that glory is not to be sought after,
because heaven is large, and the earth most strict. And he instances in
Illustrious men whose glory is perished, unless in this only, that they are
named in a very few letters.

In 8. and ultima Prosa Philosophia ostendit quod bonum est in fortuna sed
melius in adversa quam prospera, and quod adversa fortuna ostendit amicos
prospera flores nutrit.

In the 8. and last Prose Philosophy shows, what good there is in fortune, but
the greatest good in the adverse, rather then in the prosperous, and the
adverse fortune shows true friends, the prosperous nourishes a fading flower.

In Metro 8. and ultimo commendat amorem quantum facit bona, sine quo cuncta ad
interritum tenet and utinam genus hominum amor divinus regat, tunc vere ^alix
esse posset.

In the 8. and last Meeter, she commends love, how many good things it does,
without which all things tend to death, and wishes that mankind were governed
by divine love, then might it be truly happy.

LIB. III.
Tertius Liber habet 12. Prosas and 12. Metra. In Prosa 1. Boethius ostendit se
esse quodammodo curatum and paratum ad remedia graviora, and Philosophia haec
attestatur. and promittit se velle sibi ostendere faelicitatem veram, and
Boethius pet it haec.

The 3 Book has 12. Proses and 12. Meeters. In the first Boethius shows, that
he is in a manner cured, and ready for stronger medicines, and Philosophy
witnesses this, and promises that she will show him true felicity: and
Boethius requires this of her.

In 1. Metro Philosophia commendat ordinem quo primo dicunt nosci similia
sapientiae, deinde vera, and facit hoc per exempla quatuor. 1. Agro purgando,
melle gustando, imbre fugando, aere mundando.

In the 1. Meeter Philosophy commends order, by which first men say they know
like things and then true, and she does this by four examples. First, by
clearing a field, tasting honey, avoiding a shower, and purging the air.

In Prosa 2. Philosophia ostendit quod omnes hominis naturaliter appetunt
pervenire ad veram beatitudinem, cujus etiam ponit definitionem and quod
homines diversis erroribus abducuntur a vera felicitate, and ponit diversas
opiniones circa faelicitatem. Et ostendit quod quaerentes divitias velut summum
bonum errant: similiter de potentia, reverentia, and celebritate, vel gloria
and laetitia.

In the 2. Prose Philosophy shows, that all men naturally desire to come to
true happiness, and sets down the definition thereof. And that men are drawn
away from true felicity by diverse errors. And sets down diverse opinions about
felicity. And shows that those who seek riches as their chief good, do
err. In like manner, of power, reverence, celebrity, or glory, and mirth.

In Metro 2. Philosophia ponit quanta sit vis naturae, quod omnia sequuntur
suam naturam, Leones, aviculae, quasi virga violenter deorsu^ tracta, atque ita
caelum and omnia.

In the second Meeter, Philosophy sets down how great the force of nature is,
that all things follow their nature, Lions, Little-birds, as a young tree
violently drawn downward, the heaven and all other things.

In 3 Prosa osteudit Philosophia quod verafaelicitas non constat in his quibus
homines putant eam consistere. Notanter 1. quod non consistat in divitiis, eo
quod non faciant hominem in his sufficientem. 2. Quod conferant indigentiam. 3.
Invebit contra avaros quos divitias intuenti solicitudo a^xios reddit, ampliota
concupiscere facit, et ne habitae perdantur, pavore continuo compellit.

In the 3 Prose Philosophy shows, that true felicity consists not in these, in
which men think she is. Namely, first, That it consists not in riches, because
they make not a man sufficient. Secondly, That they confer upon him indigency.
Thirdly, She inveighs against the covetous, their looking of which renders them
suspicious, and careful makes them covet greater, and lest the gotten should
be lost, compells them to fear continually.

In Metro 3 ostendit quomodo dives avarus, etiamsi omnia habeat, attamen adhuc
sitire ampliora non cessat.

In the 3 Meeter she shows, how a rich covetous man although he has all, yet
cease not to thirst after greater things.

In Prosa 4. Philosophia probat quod non conferant hominibus ad reverentiam. 1.
Quod dignitas non adveniens non aufert honorem. 2. Quia dignitates manifestant
vitia improborum. 3. Quod opinione how: number vilescant. 4 Ex temporum mutatione
sordescunt et splendere desinunt, hoc ideo quod in sola opinione consistunt.

In the fourth Prose Philosophy proves, that they confer not to a man any thing
toward reverence, 1. because dignity not coming, takes not away honor.
Secondly, because dignities manifest the vices of the wicked. Thirdly, because
they wax base in the opinion of men. Fourthly, because by the change of times
they become sordid and leave their splendor, for this reason, because they
have their consistence in opinion.

In Metro 4. Philosophia, conf^^mat per ner onis exemplum cui bonum fuisset ad
imperium non venisse.

In the fourth Meeter, Philosophy confirms it by the example of Niro, to whom
it had been good not to have attained the Empire.

In Prosa 5 Philosophia, probat regnum and regni familiares veram potentiam non
confer. 1. Propter paucitatem durationis regnantium. 2. Propter parvitatem
extentionis. 3. Annexum timorem. 4. Propter absentem securitatem. 5. Propter
necessitatem manendi in Officio.

In the fifth Prose Philosophy proves, that a Kingdom and Familiars of it do
not confer true power. First, by the small lasting of it, and of the rulers,
Secondly, by reason of the narrowness of its extent. Thirdly, for the fear
that is annexed to it. Fourthly, for the absense of security. Fifthly, for the
necessity of staying in the Office.

In Metro 5 Philosophia ostendit quomodo vera potentia sit acquirenda, viz.
animos feroces domando.

In the fifth Meeter Philosophy shows, how true power may be acquired by taming
fierce minds.

In Prosa 6. Philosophia ostendit quod gloria mundana non facit hominem beatum.
1. Notanter quodest vana and fallax sed nec illa quae est meritis conquisita,
quod sapienti de gloria non est cura, neque de eo quod illa non est ejus sed
parentum, cumque quodamn odo nobilitate eo necessitat, ut ei filii nobilium
bonos parents sequantur ne degenerent. Ergo gloria mortalium hominum nihil
aliud est quam magna animae iustatio.

In the sixth Proof Philosophy shows that mundane glory makes not a man happy.
1. Signally because it is vain and deceitful and not that neither which is
got by merit. That a wise man has no regard of glory. But neither that of
nobility because that is not his but his parents, and necessitates him in a
sort that the children of good parents should follow their steps, least they
should degenerate. Therefore the glory of mortal men is nothing else than a
great swelling of the mind.

In Metro 6. Philosophia ostendit quod omnes homines sunt aeque nobiles praeter
vitiosos, Dei euim genus sumus.

In the sixth Meeter Philosophy shows that all men are equally noble besides
the vicious, for we are a kin to God.

In Prosa 7. Philosophia probat quod in voluptate non sit beatitudo eo quod
multas inco^moditates includit. Atque etiam si sic esset pecudes tunc
beatificarentur. I tem faelicitas nee est in matrimonio quia inde siunt
nequissimi filii qui tortores parentum sunt potius quam beatificatores.

In the Seventh Prose Philosophy prooves that in voluptuousness is not
beatitude, because it includes many discommodities. And if so then should
beasts be beatified. Also neither is felicity in matrimony because thereby most
wicked sons are begotten, which are rather tormentors of their Parents than
makers of their happiness.

In Metro 7. Confirmat predicta per mel and per fixuram apis, quia cum
dulcedine pungit.

In the Seventh Meeter, she confirms the aforesaid by Honey and by the Sting
of the Be because it pricks with the sweetness.

In Prosa 8. ostendit quantis malis sunt mutiplicata predicta bona. Ostendit
etiam quam vilia sunt bona corporis quae in aliis anim alibut perfectiora sunt
ut magnitudo fortitudo. Quodetiam pulchritudo nimis cito perit quae in tenni
cute flavescit.

In the eight Prose she shows with how great Evils those foresaid goods are
infolded: she also shows how base the goods of the body are, which are more
perfect in other animals, as greatness and streng th, and also that fairness
too soon perishes which waxes yellow in the thin skin.

In Metro 8. Philosophia deplangit errores hominum que^ in acquirendo minima
bona sunt prudentes, sed acquirendo summum bonum abducuntur ignorantia and haec
homines sectantes non adipisci posse, quae pollicentur and probat quod illa
quinque sufficientia, potentia, gloria, laetitia and reverentia sunt unum. Et
ergo qui quaerit unum sine aliis non invenit quod quaerit, et de isto proponit
sibi veram beatitudino^, sed prius vult Dominum invocare ut ipse eam ostendat.

In the eight Meeter, Philosophy bewaileth the error of men who in getting the
least goods are prudent, but in the acquiring of the chief good are led away
with ignorance, and she exhorts men following her, that they cannot gain that
which those things promise: and proves that those five, sufficiency, power,
glory, mirth and reverence, are one. And therefore he that seeks the one
without the other finds not that which he seeks; and from that she proposes
to her self true beatitude: but first she will pray God that he will show it.

In Metro 9. orationem optimam pro summo bono and vera beatitudine cognoscenda
ponit.

In the ninth Meeter, she makes an excellent prayer for the chief good, and
that he may know true beatitude.

In Prosa 10. Philosophia probat veram beatitudinem esse diligenter in
quirendam and ostendit in quo consistit vera beatitudo. viz in Deo, and non in
aliquo extrinseco, tanquam a Deo distincto ut in accidente quod probat
quadrupliciter. 1. Quod non inest Deo ab extrinseco. 2. Quod sic Deus non esset
summum bonum. 3. Quod est omnium principium. 4. Quod alias essent plura summa
bona: Corollarium sequitur quod omnis beatus est Deus, item ista supradicta non
sunt parts integrales beatitudinis vel membra quia Deus simplex in essentia
nihilominus multa continere beatitudo videtur quae revera ad cum referuntur.

In the tenth Prose, Philosophy proves that true felicity is to be earnestly
sought after: and he proceeds to show in which true happiness does consist, to
wit, in God, and in no other external thing that is different from God as an
accident, which he confirms with four reasons. First, because God receives it
not from an external cause. Secondly, because, if so, God could not be
himself the chiefest good. Thirdly, because God is the beginning of all
things. Fourthly, because otherewise there would be more then one chiefest
good. Hence the corollarie is, that every one that is happy is a God. Likewise
those five before mentioned are not the integrall parts or members of felicity,
because God is a simple essence: but yet true happiness seems to contain
many things which indeed are but referred unto him.

In Metro 10 Philosophia hortatur ad illam veram beatitudinem pervenire qua
inventa habentur ominia.

In the tenth Meeter Philosophy exhorts us to the attainment of true
happiness, which being found all things are found.

In Prosa 11. Ostendit quod bonum est quod omnia appetunt and inde bonum and
unumsunt reciproca and quod omnia appetunt esse, and permanere, ut
animaliaarbores and plantae cujus sunt quatuor signa, scilicet certitudo loci
and scitus dispositio partium interionum and exteriorum, and seminis
propagatio: inanimata etiam moventur ad sua propria loca per naturalem
inclinationem, and conservare unitatem per continuationem partium suarum ad
invicem nituntur, quare bonum est finis et desiderium omnium.

In the eleventh Prose he shows that it is the true good which all do desire,
and that good and one are reciprocal; and that all things desire to be, and
to continue being; as both animals, trees, and plants, which is evidenced by
four signs, that is the certainty of place and site, the forming of the
internal and external parts, and the increase of their seed: yea inanimate
creatures moove to their proper places and centers by their natural
inclinations, and they endeavor to preserve unity and continuation of their
parts one to another. Therefore that which is good, is the end and desire of
all things.

In Metro 11. Philosophia ostendit modum quo possumus per venire adcognitionem
very, scilicet per retractationem ab occupationibus exterioribus and recursum
ad interiora cum adjutorio doctrina.

In the eleventh Meeter Philosophy shows the means whereby we may come to the
knowledge of that which is rightly true: that is by withdrawing ones self from
external employments, and by having recourse to more inward things by the
help of learning.

In Pros* 12. and ultima Philosophia ostendit quibus gubernanculis mundus
regitur, and probat mundum regi a Deo tripliciter. 1. Ex connumeratione partium
diversaram. 2. Ex conservatione cunctorum. 3. Ex dispositione motuum and ex
part loci ac temporis spacii and qualitatis, and ostendit quod mundus regitur
a Deo per suam bonitatem, and quod Deus omnia disponit f^rtiter and suaviter
and quod malum nihil est, quia Deus potest omnia sed non potest malum, and
discursus omnes esse cognitos in rebus de quibus loquimur.

In the 12 Prose and last Philosophy shows by whom the world is governed: and
he prooves three ways that the world is governed by God. First from the
conjunction of parts of different nature. Secondly from the preserving them
thus joined. Thirdly from the ordering of motions in respect of place, time,
space, and quallity. And he shows that the world is governd by God, by his
Goodness, and that God disposes of all things powerfully and pleasantly, and
that evil is nothing, in that God can do all things but evil: and that the
discourses of all are known in the things of which we speak.

In Metro 12. Et ultima Philosophia hortatur ad perseverandum in contemplatione
beatitudiuis ostendens per fabulam Orphti Cytharistae quomodo affectus
mundan^rum impedit perseverantiam in bon^ quia faciliter recurris homo ad ca
quae dilexerat.

In the twelfth and last Meeter of the 13 Book Philosophy exhorts us to
persever in the contemplation of happiness, showing by the fable of Orpheus
the Musician, how that the love of worldly things hinders the perseve^^nce in
good, because man readily falls back to that which he formerly loved.

LIB. IV.
Quar. lib. habet 7. Prosas and 7. Metra egregie probantia quod Divinum regimen
optimum est et quod hoc non videtur insipie^tibus, eo quod improborum quidam
florescunt, quida^ justi conculcantur. Nihilominus quod mortales licet boni
mysterium non plene intelligunt, idcirco Philosophia benign ostendit hoc esse
rationabile.

The fourth Book has seven Proses and seven Meeters, most egregiously proving
that the Divine government is most excellent, and that this is not seen by the
unwise, by reason that some bad men flourish, and just men are trodden under
foot; notwithstanding that mortals though good, do not fully understand this
mystery, therefore Philosophy does benignly show that this is reasonable.

In 1. Prosa Boethius adhuc quasi languens non plene oblitus pristinae
turbationis incipit ingemiscere cum admiratione and intentionem Philosophiae
volentis adhuc plura loqui interrumpit inquiens? Quomodo possit hoc convenire
cum praemissis: scilicet ex quibus Deus optimus optime g^bernans omnia, quare
in suo regno vitia dominarentur, et virtutes Iuerent supplicia scelerum. Ad hoc
Philosophia pulcre respondet omnino istis perversis carere est impossible,
quod in domo been disposita vilia vasa nullo modo clarescunt, nec pretiosa
sordesc^nt, sic virtutes semper pretiosae sunt and vitia abjecta monstrantur.

In the First Prose B^ethius yet as it were languishing nor fully forgetting
his former troubles, begins to groan with admiration, and interrupts the
intention of Philosophy, willing as yet to speak more, saying how can this
agre^ with the premises; to wit, by which the best that excellently, governs
all, wherefore in his kingdom should vice domincere and virtues suffer the
punishment of wickedness. To this Philosophy fairly answers that altogether,
they are wanting all perverse things, this is altogether impossible; in a house
well ordered base vessels do no way shine, nor are the precious sordid: so
virtues are always precious and vices are declared abject.

In prim^ Metro ostendit Philosophia, quomodo possit homo plene curari, atque
ut intelligat praedicta viam per qua^ devenitur ad summum bonum: intimat
scilicet, per considerationem creaturarum, quae gradatim ascendunt more avis
sursum tendendo, usquedum perveniatur ad aliquid quod super omni creatura
illucescat, and ita per subtilem intelligentiam illius supremi rectoris qui
omnia temperatissime gubernat. Tune videbit horrendos tyrannos esse exules.

In the First Meeter Philosophy shows how a man may be fully cured, that he
may understand the foresaid, she intimates the way by which a man may come to
the chief good, to wit, by the consideration of the creatures which by degrees
are to be transcended after the manner of a bird striving upwards till you
come to somewhat that out shines all creatures, and so by the subtlety of
intelligence of that supreme rector who governs all things most temperately.
Then shall he see the horrid Tyrant to be a Banditoe.

In Prosa 2 efficaciter curam adhibet Boethio per rations mult as probando
contra vulgi opinionem, quod soli boni sunt potentes: quod volunt and possunt
adipisci bonum* and quod mali hoc non volunt, igitur non possunt and per
contrariu^ sunt impotentes. Nam duo sunt ex quibus actus humani procedunt,
scilicet voluptas and potestas ex quorum altero nihil educi possit. Item si duo
sint qui nolint unum opus fa^^re and debito modo unus procedit alter non valet,
puta ambulare qui claudus est constant quod impotens est. E^ boni sunt similes
recte incedentibus motu pedum, mal^ vero mann intendentibus deficiunt ab eo
quia natura maxim intendit scili^et a bone and ab eo tanto sint impotentiores
and miseri quanto numquod negligunt est me^ius and dicunt que boni ambulant
tantum quod nihil viae superest: mali vero in foribus errant. Item malus homo
est homo sicut homo mortuus est homo and id quod mali possunt, hoc idem est in
potentia little and ergo potentia malorum est nulla quod solum malum and hoc est
nihil, quod Deus potest omnia and non potest malum. Item mali non sunt boni,
igitur non sunt potentes quod potentia est ^ona^ item naturaliter omnes
app^tuut omne quod potest desiderariscil summum bonum in quo est vera
beatitudo. Liquit igitur illos solos potentes qui hoc possunt adipisci sed hoc
mali nequeunt quia ad beatitudinem pr^bra id est vitia non veniunt.

In the third Prose Philosophy uses efficaciously the cure to Boethius proving
by many reasons the contrary to the vulgar opinion, that only the good are
powerful, because they will and obtain good; And that the bad will not
therefore they cannot, and by the contrary are impotent. For two things there
are from which men's veiw does proceed to wit, pleasure and power, of which the
one can produce nothing. Also if there be two which will not do the same work,
and one of them proceed in a deue manner, the other, cannot, for instance walk,
he that is lame is apparently impotent. And the good are l^ke those that go up
right by the motion of their feet. But the evil like those who endeavor by
the hard, because they fail of that which nature principally intends; to wit,
good, and by that they are moan impotent and miserable by how much the good
they neglect is the better, and they say the good walk so far that there is
nothing remaining of their way, but the bad do err even in their setting
forth. Also a bad man is a man as a dead man is a man, and whatsoever a bad man
can do this is no more than impotency, and therefore the power of the bad is
now, because they can only do evil and that is nothing, that God can do all
things, yet cannot do evil, also the evil are not good therefore they are not
powerful because power is good, Also naturally all desire all that may be
desired, to wit, the chief good in which is the chief beatitude. Therefore it
is plain they are only potent who can obtain this, but this the wicked cannot,
because to beatitude wickedness that is vices come not.

In Metro 2. Ostendit regulam de principibus hujus seculi si sunt mali and
quomodo veraciter sint impotentes quia non possunt facere quod volunt, and
quasi ligati gravibus catenis, atque etiam acerbis passionum acultis;
flagellantur nee unquam tranquilli sunt, sed rabis, superbia, libidine,
tristitia, and spe vana agitantur.

In the second Meeter she shows a rule concerning the potentates of this age,
that if they be evil, how truly impotent they are, because they are not able
to do what they would, being as it were fettered with weighty chains. They are
also scourged with the sharp pricks of their passions; nor have any
tranquillity, but are actuated with fury, pride, lust, sadness, and vainhope.

In 3 Prosa ostendit malis nunquam de^sse sua supplicia, nec bonis deesse sua
praemia Nullam esse piaeminis^ respectu boni: sed boni nunquam carent bono, eo
quod nemo potest ^sse benus qui b^no caret, igitur nunquam carent praemio. Item
omnis paena est de ratione mali, quia mali nunquam volunt carere malo, igitur
nu^quam care^t supplicio, supplicium ^ui^^ summum est expertem esse boni; haec
autem paena quainseperabiliter adest malis naturam vehementer inficit, and ab
huma^a condition dejicit. Ita quod probitate derelicta, unusquisque hominem
esse desierit, nic in statum divinum transire possit, and in belluam vertitur
ita avarus ut lupus, iracundus, cauis, fraudulentut vulpes, accidiosus asinus,
inconstans, avis dicip^test. Econtra cum ipsum bonum beatitudo sit bonos omnes
co ipso quo boni sunt fieri, beatot liquet, and quod beat^ sunt cos convenit
esse deo^, quod utique summum praemium est in auferibile. Et quia praemium
bonorum est fieri Deos, supplicium malorum est bestias fieri.

In the third prose she shows that evil men never want their punishments, nor
good men their rewards.

That there is no reward but in respect of good. But good men never want good.
Because none can be good who want good, therefore they never want their reward:
so likewise all punishment is in respect of evil, because evil men will never
want evil, therefore they never want punishment. For it is the greatest
punishment to be void of good, but this punishment which inseperably
accompanies evil men very much defiles nature, and precipitates from humanity,
so that when goodness being relinquished, any one ceases to be a man, nor can
be changed into a divine he is transformed into a brute, as a covetous man may
be called a wolf, an angry man a dog, a deceitful man a fox, a sluggish man
an ^sse, an inconstant man a bird: on the contrary good it self being a
beatitude, it is clear that all good men are made happy in that wherein they
are good, and they who are happy likewise they are good, and their reward is
not to be taken away: and because it is the reward of good men to be made Gods,
it is the punishment of the evil to be made Beasts.

In Metro 3. Phil^sophia solacii causa fabulam introduduei Vlissis ^ujus socii
per fae^inam quandam qua Circe dicebatur in diversas bestias corporaliter, non
mentalliter, quia sensum retin^bant, transformati fuerant ^t concludit quod
transformatio mentis per vitia, corpore manent^ e^dem, pejor est quam
transformatio corporis in billuam, aut pecus anima sua manent^, si talis per
naturam transformatio possibilis esset.

In the third Meeter, for comfort sake, Philosophy bringing the story of
Ulisses, whose companions were transformed by one Circe into several beasts,
corporally not mentally, because they retained sense. And she con^ludes that
the transformation of the mind by vices, the body remaining the same, is worse
then a corporal Metamorphoses into a beast or brute, the soul remaining. the
seem if a transformation by nature could possible be.

In Prosa 4. Boethius rationibut supradictis assentit mali sunt infalices,
ta^en adhuc quasi stato more ^i^ indig nature qui serviunt in b^nos and vellet
quod hoc ita non esse poss^t, sed potius cito auferrentur de medio. Hanc
impatientiam arguit Pihlosophia, and suo loco probare promittit quod non licet
sapienti sic indig^ari, sed majis compati, fucimus corpotaliter ^grotis; valde
enim miseri sunt vitiosi dum cupit a qua volunt perfi^iant and miseriores quam
si ^a perficere non possunt, and subjungit quod mali sunt faeliciores qui
puniti sunt quam qui ^on sant puniti, and tanto insaeliciores quanto
diuturniores, and quanto minus puniuntur* and quod illi sunt miseriores qui
faciunt injuriam quam qui came patiuntur. Ostendit etiam qua miseria malorum
esset sine fine si or um vita esset infinita and quod malitia eorum est
miseria, and addit quod malos puniri bonum est. Primo quod aliquan^o
resipiscunt a malo; secundo quod alii videntes little terrorem, declinat a malo*
3. quod ^orum miseriae additur aliquid boni, scil. paena quae rati^ne justiciae
bona est, and quod propter malum purgatorium vel infernum post mortem
requiritur, et quod opinio vulgi contraria est opi^ni Philosophia, and quod
opinioni vulgi non sit assentiendum; and ille qui facit injuria est puniendus
and non cui sacta est primus igitur est inferior, atqu^ iudices potius debenti
mitari ut compatiantur facientibus injuriam quam eundem patientibus Quia ergo
ad sapientium pertinet omne odium a se repellere and cunctis velle prodesse imo
debent clementer expectare and provocare discholos ad panitentiam, and pl^s
compatihis qui inferunt injuriam, quam qui patiantur tanquam infaelicioribus
op^rtet.

In the fourth Prose B^^thius yields to the reasons above mentioned, that evil
men are unhappy, yet still after the common custom has indignation for them
because they tyrannize over the good, and would that this could not be so, but
rather that they might suddenly be cut off. Philosophy condemns this passion
and promises in it proper place to prove that it is unlawful for a wife man*
to be so angry but rather to suffer, as we show in those who are bodily sick:
for wicked men are very miserable even when they bring to pass what they do
desire, and more miserable then if they did not effect them. And she adds that
the evil are more happy who are punnisht then those who are not punished, and
by how much the more durable and less punished by so much they are the more
miserable. And that they are more miserable who do an injury then who suffer
it. Further more she shows that the affliction of the evil are infinite if
thire life could be so; and that their malice is their misery, and adds that is
good for them to be punished. First because some time they repent them of the
evil. Secondly that some apprehending terrors do decline them from evil.
Thirdly, because there is some good annexed to their misery, viz. punishment
which in respect of justice is good. And that after death there is purgatory or
hell required for evil. And that the opinion of the vulgar is contrary to the
opinion of Philosophy, and that we must not be led by their opinion. The first
therefore is the inferior, and Judges ought to imitate ratherin this thing,
that they may have Compassion of them that do the injury, then on them that
suffer it. Therefore they that have any relation unto wisdom, ought to repel
from themselves all hatred, and to have a desire to profit all men, yea they
ought to expect for and to provoke aldisobedient men to repentance, and ought
to have compassion the more on those which offer the wrong, then those that
suffer it, as the more miserable

In quarto Metro Philosophia jucunde confirmat quae dixit et exclamat contra
homines illos qui bellicis motibus se i^viom ex odio ad m^rtem deducunt, hoc
dicens quod nemo debet mortem malorum desiderare quae de se quam plurimus sine
bello appropinquat and quod just quoque diligendi sunt boni and mali
misericorditer.

In the fourth Meter Philosophy delectably confirms what she had delivered, and
exclaims against such who by warlike commotions proceeding from enmity, mutally
kill one another saying, that no man ought to desire the death of the evil,
which of it self without wars, approaches many; and that good men are to be
loved of right, and the evil out of compassion.

In Prosa 5. Boethius quafi proficiens in scientia plures incipit dubitationes
habere quam antea habuit; and ait, perpendo qu^d in bonis fortuitis est aliquid
boni, eo quod expediens est Rhetoribus et sapientibus and politiarum
gubernatoribus casden habire and nunc stuporem meum Deus Rector exaggerat qui
in bonis fortuitis prosperitatem constituit and recta ratione mundum gubernat.
Quare ergo prospera and adversa accidunt bonis and malis and quasi diceret, si
essem pollens opibus, bonore reverendus, potentia validus etc. ut olim tunc
modica ratio sufficeret, sed quia affligor, impatienti me vexat, and idcirco
toties ad quaerendum incitor and pro consolation^, causam husus rei desidero,
and quare carceres and cruces inventae propter malos saepissime eveniant bonis:
and Philosophia respo^dit quod sic videtur esse propter ignorantiam scil. causa
fati and divinae providentiae.

In the fifth Prose Boethius becoming a proficient in knowledge makes more
doubts then formerly, and says I consider that in contingent goods there is
some good, because it is very meet for rulers and wisemen and the Governors of
Commonwealths to reflect on them, and now God the ruler of all augments my
amazement, who in contingent good can place prosperity and governs the world in
due order. Why then do prosperity and adversity indifferently befall good and
evil men, as if he should say, were I rich, honorable, and potent, etc. as
heretofore, then an indifferent reason might satisfy, but seeing I am
afflicted, I am vexed with impatience, and for this cause have so many
incitations to make my complaints, and for consolation desire the cause of
this, and why that prisons and crosses found out for the punishment of the
evil, become very often the portion of good men. And Philosophy answers that
it is ignorance. viz in the cause of fate and divine providence that maks it
appear so.

In 5. Metro. Phil. quasi viam praparando ad informandum B^^thium dicit quod
^^mmu^^ est hominibus res h^^ mirari quarum diuig^^rarant caus^^, sed illis
s^iti^ c^ssat stup^r and eximplum dat demotu siderum arcturo at que Vrsa
majore, quare scil. tardius movenour, and de eclipsi lunae and solis qua
ignorantibus mira videntur, quia nemo miratur de inquietudine aquarum slante
Borea Zephyro similiter de nivibus a solis solutis sic in proposito si causa
cesset cessat and admiratio and durante causae ignorantia, durat admiratio.

In the fifth Meter, Philosophy by preparing the way to inform Beethins, saying
that it is usual with men to admire those things whose causes they have been
long ignorant of, but that all admiration is past asloon as they are known, he
instances in the motion of the constellation Arcturus viz the greater Bear why
it moves so slow. And in the Eclipse of the moon and sun, which ignorant people
very much admire, so likewise it falls out, why none wonder at the roughness of
the waters when the Northwest wind blows, or the suns dislolving the snow,
even so in this case the cause and the admiration both cease together, and the
admiration of the cause continues as long as the ignorance thereof.

In Prosa 6. Boethius instat propter declarationem quastionis superius motae
scil. quare malis bona and bonis mala contingant. Et Philosophia praemittit
ejusdem difficultatem quia subjectum hujus eiusmodi est ut una dubitatione
soluta aliae innumerabiles succr^scant, sed tamen quoniam afflictis ista scire
expedit; ideo saltem de illis pauca narrabit and ponit quod divina mentis
stabilitas omnia gubernat, statuit and disponit. Pramittit etiam quod oportet
scire quid sit providentia, and quid fatum and tunc ad hoc quod quaritur recto
ordine procedit, providentia ergo est ipsa divina ratio in summo omnium
principe sita, vel planius hoc modo providentia est dispositio divina, sive
ordinatio existens in mente divina qua cuncta inferiora secundum statum sua
naturae sunt provisa: slatum vero est dispositio inharens rebus molibus per
quam providentia, omni inectit suis ordinibus, and ponit quod providentia and
fatum non sunt eadem, and quod fa^um cum omnibus sibi subjactantibus a
providentia dependat: diversas opiniones circa fatum componit. Scil. a quibus
vel ex quo exerceatur and quod omnia quae fato subiecta sint divinae etiam
providentia subjacent and none converso and hoc de circulis super cundem axem
ut unum super alterum and quanto exprimo modus quid firmius divinae
providentiae adhaereat tanto firmius a fatali mutatione servatur; deinde
Philosophia comparat habitudinem fati divinae providentiae per quatuor similia
comparat and quod fatum habet se ad providentiam sicut ratiocinatio ad
intellectum: idquod tactum est ad id quod est a seipso, tempus ad aternitatem:
and circulus ad punctum medium, postea ostendit quae sint illa quae fato
disponuntur^ and quod co quae apparent in reb^u consusa non intelligentibus,
sunt in divina providentia and gubernatione ordinata: and qui potest ista
animadvertere optimam in singulis inveniet rationem. Item quod indifferenter
bonis and malis prospera and adversa contingunt quae non fortuito, sed sum, mo
rationis libramine and ex providentia ordinatoris procedunt quosdam siquidem
praemio, quosdam supplico; deinde dignos praecognoscit causam generalem
ostendit quare malis bona and bonis mala contingant, scil. quod homines quae
sunt in seipsi bona vel mala nesciunt, probans per similitudinem medici
scientis diversis corporibus diversa convenire medicamenta and quod nescientes
varietatem corporum diver sificatorum in complexionibus curationis rationem
ignorant, probat etiam hoc ex contrario judicio dei and hominum, allegans
Lucanum de judicio Deorum and Catonem deinde causas speciales enarrat, quare
malis bona eveniunt: and una est, b^ia deteriores fieri potuerunt si hoc bonum
eis non evenisset, quod autem bonis mala non eveniunt fa^it torum meritum, and
ideo ^is bona eveniunt, ut praevalens improbitas reprimeretur. Item si quidem
modesti affligorentur animo fractiessent bonos reprimi and eisdem tot mala
evenire hoe etiam quia aliqui eorum ex longa faelicitate gloriari possent, and
si non his malis exercitarentur superbirent. 2. ut inde malis mereantur and
virtutum excitatione consirmentur. 3. ne plus metuerent quam oportet. 4. ne
aliquis plus presumit quam debeat. 5. propter preiose mortis gloriam. 6 propter
eximplum aliorum. Quod autem mala malis adveniunt nemo admiratur, sed quod eis
bona eveniunt. Prima causa est ne fiant pojores. 2. ut emendentur. 3. ut carum
miseria major existat: deinde ostendit causam quare mali malos puniant quia ita
tales mals fiunt boni. Donique contra hujus rei tractationem ampliorem exclamat.

In the sixth prose Boethius is still very sollicitous for the declaring the
question above mentioned, viz. why good befalls evil men, and evil befalls
good men, and Philosophy premises the difficulty thereof, because the subject
is such that upon the solution of one doubt many more will emerge, but because
it is expedient for the afflicted to know these things she will speak something of
them, and lays down that the stability of the divine power regulates,
determines, and disposes all things. She premises farther, that it is necessary
to know what is providence and fate, and then in due order proceeds to the
question. Providence therefore is a divine c^unsell sited in the prince of
allthings. Or more plainly thus, Providence is a divine disposition or
ordination in the divine mind, whereby all inferiors things are considered
according to the state of their nature. But fate is a disposition inherent in
things moveable, whereby providence chains all things in their courses. And she
lays down that providence and fate are not the same, and that fate with what
ever is subordinate to it, depends on providence. And she lays down several
opinions, concerning fate of whom it is exercised. And that all things that are
subject to fate are also subject to divine providence, but not on the contrary.
And she manifests this in circles moved one above another, as upon the same
axle tree, and by how much any thing adheres the more steadfastly to divine
providence, by so much the more certainly it is defended from fatal mutation.
Furthermore Philosophy compares the habitude of fate to divine providence by 4
similies, to wit, late has relation to providence as ratiocination to the
intellect, that which is made to that which is of it self. Time to eternity;
and the circle to the Center. Afterward she demonstrates which are those
things which are disposed by fate, and that those things which appear confused
in matters to those which understand not, are ordained in divine providence and
government, and he which is able to make his observation of these things, shall
find excellent reason in every one of them. In like manner that prosperity and
adversity wayed indifferently to good and bad, proceeds not by fortune but with
the most exact poyze of reason, from the providence of him that ordained, for
as much as he knows some worthy of reward, some of punishmont. Afterward she
show the general reason, why good things happen to evil men, and evil to
the good, to wit because men are ignorant which things are good and evil in
themselves, proving by the similitude of a Physician knowing that different
medicines are suitable to different constitutions, others being ignorant of the
variety of Bodies diversifyed in their Complexions are ignorant of the reason
of the diversity of theirs, she also proves this from the judgment of man
contrary to that of God. Alleging Lucan concerning the judgment of the Gods,
and Cato: afterward shelayes down especial reasons, why good things happen to
evil men, and the one is because they might have been worse, if this good had
not happened. But first the evil things happen not to good men, their merit is
in the cause and therefore good things happen to them that their impiety
prevailing may be repressed. Likewise if certain modest men should be afficted,
they would be discouraged, because good men are repressed, and evils happen to
them: This so falls out because some of them would be apt to boast of the
duration of their felicity, and were they not exercised, might grow proud.
Secondly, that from thence their merits might be the greater, and by this
exercise might be confirmed in their virtues: Thirdly, that some are more
fearful then is requisite: Fourthly, because some presume more of themselves
then they ought: Fifthly, for the glory of a precious death: Sixthly, for the
example of others. But why evil things happen to evil men, none admires, but
that they should participate of good; the first reason is, that they become not
worse: the second, that there might be some amendment: thirdly, that their
misery might be the greater. Afterward she declares the reason, why wicked men
punish those that are wicked, because so such evil men become good. Lastly,
she exclaimeth on any larger handling of the matter.

In Metro 6. confirmat Philosophia quae dicta sunt per similitudinem, jucunde
alloquens Boethium, ut ita recreatas ad sublimiora tenderet, and divinam
commendat providentiam in regimine corporum caelestium, Elementorum temporum,
generabilium and corruptibilium, ex authoritate Dei regentis. Ait ergo si tibi
plac^erit pura mente summi Dei judici^ intelligere, aspice calum, and
disciplinam stellarum, and anni cursus quam varii videntur, and tamen unum non
confundit alterum, sic in actibus humanis omnia recte ordinantur. In the 6.
Meeter Philosophy confirms those things which were spoken of by a similitude,
pleasantly treating with Boethius that so being refreshed, he might tend to
sublimer matters, and she commends the divine power in the government of the
celestial bodies, Elements, Times, Generables, and corruptibles, from the
authority of God ruling, she says therefore, if thou desire with a pure
mind to understand the judgments of the most high God, reflect on the Heaven,
and the discipline of the stars, and the seasons of the year, how different
they seem, and nevertheless, one confounds not another, so in humane acts
all things are rightly dispensed.

In Prosa 7. concludit Philosophia ex pradictis quod omnis fortuna est bona,
tanquam adeo infallibiliter administrata unicuique secundum sua merita, nam
iucundos renumerat, asperos exercet vel decurtat, and ostendis quod vulgi
sententia sit contrarium quasi dicat o Boethi ne sequaris vulgi opinionem qui
semper de rebus pessime censent sed attend quod mutua potestate sit, qualem
vis fortuna^ fingere, et per haec tantem hortatur, fortunam suam magnanimiter
tollerare, and in hominis potestate constitutum, formare sibi fortunam, qualem
vult, concludit.

In the seventh Prose Philosophy concludes from the premises that all fortune
is good, as it were infallibly distributed to every one according to his
merits, for she rewards the ple^sant, she exercises or takes short the
stubborn, and lays open that it is contrary to the vulgar, as if she should
say. O Boethius have a care that thou adhere not to the opinion of the vulgar,
which always judge things in the worst sense. But observe that it is in thy own
power to forge out thy own fortune, and by this exhorts him at length to bear
fortune with a courage, concluding it to be in the power of man to frame to
himself what fortune he pleases.

In Metro septimo Philosophia suadelam suam exemplo virorum fortium, qui
spretis voluptatibus and spe laudis and gloria labores maximos subjere
confirmat and per hoc hortatur virtute praeditos ut a proposite suo propter
labores non desista^t quia difficile enim me dium tenere, and pouit tres
fabulas quasi sola^ii causa ipsi Boethio ne nimium seriis gravetur, atque sic
concludit o fortes ite nunc per vias altas ad superna, si tanta fecerunt in
fideles pro gloria iuani, cur vos inertes and pigri terga virtutis, id est,
labores respuit is? quando terrenis and carnalibus superath praemia vobis
celestia largientur.

In the seventh Meeter Philosophy confirms her exhortation by the example of
Courageous men, who despising pleasures for the hope of praise and glory have
undergone the greatest labors. By this she exhorts virtuous men, that they
desist not from their purpose because of labors: For it is difficult to keep a
mean, it lays down three fables, as it were solacing Boethius that he might
not be oppressed with serious matters: But she concludes, o valiant men steer
your course toward heaven. If infidels have effected so great things for vain
glory, why do ye sluggards and slothful men turn your backs, that is, refuse
labors, seeing earthly and Carnal things being conquered, heavenly rewards
shall be abundantly bestowed upon you.

LIber hic De Consolatione, a Praeceptore meo Wintoniensi Doctore Nicolao Love
streni loco dabatur ab ipso pro duodenario nulla expositione adhibita. Quid ad

revocare studuerit. Quod ad me spectat quicquid vel ad expositionem vel ad
ornatum hujus libri faceret omnino non omittendum censeo. Ideoque aliquid,
parum licet, de meo protult and fortassis in paucis multa and utilia quod in
bonam partem consulat lector ingenuus inveniet. Nunc Boethium ipsum spectet.

Boethianae sunt hae quae sequuntur liniae, incipientes in Metro 9. lib. 3. Non
quod quae procedunt sint inutilia, sed quod quae sequuntur sint Explicatione
and Commentario digniora, quas Thomas Aquinas Angelicus licet Doctor haud recte
interpretatur.
O Qui perpetua mundum ratione gubernas,
Terrarum caeli: que sator, qui tempus ab aevo
Ire jubes, stabilisque manens das cuncta moveri,
Quem non externae pepulerunt fingere causae
Materiae fluitantis opus; verum insita summe^
Forma boni, livore carens, tu cuncta superno
Ducis ab exemplo: pulchrum pulcherremus ipse
Mundum mente gerens, similique in imagine formans,
Perfectasque jubens perfectum absolvere parts.
Hic Angelicus Doctor paulam cecutit, and cum haec ad mentem Aristotelis
trahere vult Platonicum frustra conatus ejus sunt, nihilque obtinet: de Idaeis
nunc secundum P^atonem dicendum, primo de Idaea materiae fluitantis, id est.
materia prima quae ideo sluitans dicitur quia nullam stabilem habebat formam,
sed omnium ex aequo formarum capax: Terra erat inanis and vacu and tenebra
erant super faciem Abissi. (In fita sumis sorma boni, haec universalis Idea and
communicative, livere c^^^^s) odio etiam and aversione, nam Deus vidit o^^ia
qua fecerat and erant valde bona in ^uncta superno etc. Generalis haec ell
Idaea antedicti perfectasque jubes perfictum absolvere parts, sed non est
anima mundi nisi Deus.

Tu numeris clementa ligas, ut frigor a flammis
Arida conveniant liquidis: ne purior ignis
Evolet, aut mersas deducant pondere terras.
Nunc collectae aquae erant and te^ra apparuit: Aquae vocabaniur Mars, Terra
vocabantur Aridum.

Tu triplicis mediam naturae cuncta moventem
Connectens animam per consona membra resolvis.
Quae cum secta duos motum glomeravit in orbs,
In semet reditura meat, mentemque profundam
Circuit, and simili convertit imagine caelum.
Quaeto, quaesivi atque adhuc quaeto interpretationem horum versuum, neque
adhuc invenio; neque quisquam, uti spero non expectet solidum: sed qualemcunque
habucrit boni consulat and uberiorem vel det vel m^cum desideret.

Thomas noster, licet Angelicus, non deditimo magis sensum eorum obscuravit
vultis habere quod loquitur ille magister nostrandus vel noster magistrandus,
sic habeto, attamen nihil habes nisi ejusdom verba.

Hic Philosophia ostendit sapientiam ex animae mundi productione ubi sciendum,
quod ita communiter exponuntur ad intentionem. Platonis, in Timeo, sed quod
ista expositio est difficillima et modicae utilitatis ego came pertranseo, and
ponam facilem and expeditam quae est ad mentem Atistotelis, ad cujus evidentiam
notandum est quod per animam mundi intelligitur hic intelligentia movens orbem
quae per metum suum virtutem in inferioribus addit. Haec intelligentia dicitur
media inter deum and anim^m humanam: sicut enim in dignitate and perfectione
exceditur a deo sic ipsi animam nostram excedit: notandum quod intelligentia
hujusmodi dicitur triplicis naturae, propter tres operationes quas habet,
movere orbem, intelligere Deum and intelligere seipsam, notandum quod orbs
ceelestes dicuntur consona membra intelligentiae, quod per ipsos tanquam per
organa et instrumenta intelligentia inferioribus influat: Licet enim
intelligentia prima, intention moveat propter se, tamen secunda movet propter
inferiora, his praemissis ita perspicuum est ut dici potest. Tu Deus animam
spiritu^ mundi, quae est intelligentiamedia supple inter te and animam humanam
triplicis naturae id est, triplicis operationis cuncta moventem: supple
inferiora per influxum illum: tu connectens resolvis, id est distinguis eam per
consona membra, id est, per convenicutes orbs, quae anima cum secta id est
divisa, quae tum ad operationes glomeravit id est impressit motum in duos orbs
supple in orbem primi mobilis and in plenetatum ipsa redditura id est reflexa
motu procedit in semetipsam, semetipsam intelligendo quae est una operatio: et
ipsa circuit mentem profundam id est divinam, Deum intelligendo quae est alia
operatio: ipsa convertit id est movet coelum simili imagine id est
intellectione, quod est tertia ejus operatio. Notandum etiam quod licot corpora
coelestia sint diversa, tamen ratione unitatis unum Corpus dici possunt, sic
licet intelligentiae sint diversae, tamen possunt dici una intelligentia
propter unitatem ordinis in operatione movendi, ergo in singulari dicitur
Animam and non Animas.

Haec non egent confutatione ita sibi minime cohereant: vis meam sententiam,
mallem certe sequi doctorem quemcumque probubitem quam meam proferre, nam nec
mea mihi placet, sed qualiscunque sit in bonam p^rtem consules and emendes si
placeat sic habe, Tu triplicis mediam naturae cuncta moventem, Connectens
animam per consona membra resolvit: tu connectens med^um animam triplicis
naturae id est, connectis mediam animim humanum (scil.) triplicis naturae id
est vegetativae, sensitivae, and rationalis per consona membra id est, per
consonas facultates resolvis, quae dum secta duos motum glomeravit in orbs
vegetativam and sensitivam facultatem. In semet redditura meat mentemque
prosundam Circuit, id est meat in mentem profundam nempe suipsius rationalem,
Circuit and simili convertit imagine coelum (id est) mentem ipsius: horreo enim
dicere quod anim a creata mentem divinam circue^e p^ssie, ita l^quitur Thomas
Aquinas, sed si licu^sset mihi hos versus interpretare de anima Christi Dei
pariter and hominis, manifestior esset sententiae totius exp^sicio.

Tu causis animas paribus, vitasque minores
Provehis, and levibus sublimeis currilus aptans
In coelum, terramque seris: quas lego benigna
Ad te conversas reduci facis igne reverti.
Quamvis vani sua sint quae Thomas profert nihil tamen de iis dicere quoniam
nihil sunt.

Tu provehis animas vitasque minores causis, and seris in coelum terramque
aptans sublimeis levibus curribus, Quas benigna legereduci facis, et ad te
conversus igne reverti.

Platonicum hae nimis sapiunt qui universas animas creaautumabatur cum luce
vera autem Philosophia dicit de animis humanis quod creando infunducitur ex
infundendo creantur, nova est enim formatio uniuscujusque hominis and eductio.

Da pater augustam menti conscendere sedem
Da fontem lustrare boni, da luce reperta
In te conspicuos animi defigere visus.
Diljisce terrenae nebulus and pondera molis,
Atque tuo splendore mica, tu namque serenum,
Tu requies tranquilla piis: te cernere finis,
Principium, vector, dux, semita, terminus idem.
Thomas hic mihi satisfecit sua expositione, pluribus non opus est.

Lib. 3. MIT. XI.
QVIS quis profunda mente vestigat verum,
Cupit que nullis ille deviis falli,
In se revolvat intimi lucem visus,
Longosque in orbem cogat inflectens motus.
Animumque doceat quidquid extra molitur,
Suis retrusum possidere thesauris.
Dudum quod atra texit erroris nubis.
Lucebit ipso perspicacius Phoebo.
Non omne namque mente depulit lumen,
Obliviosam corpus invehens molem
Haeret profecto semen introrsum very,
Quod excitatur ventilante doctrina.
Nam cur rogati sponte recta censetis,
Ni mersus alto viverit fomes cord?
Quod si Platonis Musa personat verum,
Quod quisquis discit, immemor recordatur.
Expressa sunt haec and facilia ideoque interpretatione non egent.

Prosa 12. incipit Philosophia tractationem de malo sed quia parva profert
omittends, donec in tramatur, pleniore rem exponat, existimo.

In Prosa 4. Lib. 4. haec sunt, nullane animarum supplicia post mortem
relinquis? and magna quidem inquam, quorum alii paenali acerbitate alii vero
purgatoria clementia exerceri puto.

De his Thomas noster commentatur, assensum tamen meum praebere non possum Nam
post mortem supplicia nulla sunt temporalia, ubi tum Purgatorius ignis: in die
tantum iudicii cernitur ubi corpus igne mundatur, and stramine a quae
comburuntur and corpus tanquam metallum purificatur and ita immortale fiat.

Lib. 5. MET. 3.
QUAE nam discors faedera rerum
Causa resolvit? quis tanta d^^^
Veris statuit bella duobus,
Ut quae carptim singula constent,
Eadem nolent mista jugari?
An nulla est discordia veris,
Semperque sibi circa cohaerent,
Sed men's, caecis obruta membris,
Nequit oppressi luminis igne
Rerum tenueis noscere nexus;
Sed cur tanto flagrat amore
Very tectas reperire notas?
Scitne, quod appetit anxia nosse?
Sed quid nota rescire laborat?
Et si nescit, quid caeca petit?
Quis enim quidquam nescitus optet?
Aut quis valeat nescitasequi?
Quove inveniat, quisve repertam
Queat ignarus noscere formam?
An cum mentem cerneret altam,
Pariter summam and singula nor at?
Nunc membrorum condita nube,
Non in totum est oblita sui,
Summamque tenet singula perdeus.
Igitur quisquis vera requirit,
Neutro est habitu, nam neque nevit,
Nee penitus tamen omnia nescit:
Sed, quam retinens meminit, summans
Consulit, alte visa retractaus,
Ut servatis queat oblitas
Addere parts.
Lib. 5. MET. 4.
QUONDAM porticus attulit
Obscuros nimium senes,
Qui sensus, and imagines
E corporibus extimis
Credant mentibus imprimi,
Ut quondum celeri stylo
Mos est aequore paginae
Quae nullas habeat notas,
Pressas figere literas.
Sed men's si propri is vigoris
Nihil motibus explicat,
Sed tantum patiens jacet
Not is subdita corporum,
Cassasque in speculi vicem
Rerum reddit imagines,
Unde haec sic animis viget
Cernens omnia notio;
Quae vis singula prospicit,
Quae divisa recolligit,
Aut quae cognita dividit:
Alternumque legens iter
Nunc summis caput inserit,
Nunc desidit in insima,
Tum sese referens sibi,
Veris falsa redarguit?
Haedest efficiens magis
Long causa potentior,
Quam quae materia modo
Impressas patitur notas.
Praecedit tamen excitans,
Ac vires animi movens,
Vivo in corpore passio.
Cum vel lux oculos ferit,
Vel vox auribus instrepit:
Tum mentis vigor excitus,
Quas intus species tenet,
Ad motus similes vocans,
Notis applicat exteris,
Introrsumque reconditis
Formis miscet imagines.
Non hoc Metrum omittendum est totam enim viam and scientiae and error is
indicat: sed jam recollige quae dispersae sunt in quinque libris de
Consolatione Boethianae and si placent Commentariolum tuum add: Brevissimum
certe eri^quod de tribus prioribus, libris, agitantur: in primo Bo^^hius
Conditionem suam post ejus exilium plangit and Philosophia cum consolatur. In
2. ostendit nec fortunam, nec ulla alia externa vel bona, vel mala esse. In 3.
tractatum habet de faelicitate falsa. In hoc libro sparsae sunt aliquae
sententiae quas recolligere necessum erit.

Prosa ultima Li. 3.
Philosophia quaerit number Deus facere malum possit, concludit malum, igitur
nihil est, cum id facere ille non potest, qui nihil non potest.

Nunc licet paulisper expatiari, si malum nihil sit, quare Deus irascatur
nihilo? revera tamen malum nihil est and tamen ira Dei justa est and reale
objectum habet annon haec ludi^r^ sunt: imo seria peccatum fatcare aliquid and
hoc solum malum; at si quid peccatum sit quaeris, est aversio mentis a Deo and
conversio ejusdem creaturae quam Deus sibi constituit. Hoc situm est in animo
malum, sed essentiam in se nullam habet and enim tantum independentiam a deo,
conatur quod nec efficere potest animi mala cupiditas quae in eorum animo
impedimentum, and nihil aliud est ideoque in rerum natura vere nihil: nam quam
materiam vel formam habet merus conatus.

PROSA 6. Lib. 4.
I am jam maximo conamine opus est, aude aliquid brevibus Gyat is aut coarcere
dignum.

Hic ipsa Philosophia ex Boethiana Christiana est, itaque ab Ethnica trahit
spiritum anhelum, parce tamen inquam: ejusmodi namque materia est ut una
dubitatione succisa, innumerabiles aliae, velut Hydrae capita succrescunt, nec
ullius fecerit modum nisi quis cas vivacissimo mentis igne coerceat. In hac
enim de providentia simplicitate, de fati serie, de repentinis casibus, de
cognitione and praedestinatione divina de arbitrii liberate quaeri solet quae
quanti sunt oneris ipse perpendito.

PROSA 1. Lib. 5.
Tractat casum and fortunam and ita textus in se continet: libet ig^ur sic
definire casum esse: scilicet, inopinatum and confluentibus causis in his quae
ob aliquid geruntur, evenrum* Concurrere vero and consluere: causas facit ordo
ille inevitabilis connexione procedens qui de providentiae font descendens,
cuncta fuis locis and temporibusque disponit.

PROSA 2.
Manet autem liberum arbitrium neque enim fuerit ulla rationalis natura quin
eidem libertas assit arbitrii.

Sed hanc non in omnibus aequumesse statuo, nam superiis and divir is
substantiis and per^picax judicium et imorrupta voluntas and efficax optatorum
presto est potestas. In humanis vero animis libertas quidem esse necesse est
cum se in mentis divinae speculatione conservant, minus vero cum dilabuntur ad
corpora, minusque etiam cum terrenis actibus colligantur, extrema vero est
servitus cum vitiis deditus ra^ionis propriae poss^ssione exciderint.

PROSA 3.
Quid igitur quonam modo Deus haec incerta futura pernoscit nam si
inevitabiliter eventura censet quae etiam non eventura possibile est, fallitur,
quod non sentire modo nefas est sed etiam voce proferre. At si quemadmodum
sint, ita ea futura esse decrevit, ut aeque vel fieri ea vel non fieri posse
cognoscat quae est haec, praescientia, quae nihil certum nihil stabile
comprehendit. At quid hoc prefertur vaticinio illo Tyrhesiae ridiculo quic quid
dicam aut erit aut non erit, quid etiam Divina Providentia humana opinio
prestiterit si veluti homines incerta judicat quorum est incertus eventus: Quod
si apud illum rerum omnium certissimum fontem nihil incerti esse potest certus
little est eventus quae futura firmiter ille prescivit. Quare nulla est humanis
consiliis actionibusque libertas quas Divina men's sine falsitatis errore cuncta
perspiciens ad unum aligat ac constringit eventum, quo semel recepto quantus
occasus humanarum rerum consequutus esse liquet: frustra enim bonis malisque
praemia paenaeve proponuntur quas nullus meruit liber ac voluntarius motus
animorum, idque enim videbitur iniquissimum quod nunc aequissimum judicatur vel
punire improbos vel remunerare probos, nec vitia igitur nec virtutes quicquam
in definiendo fuerint.

PROSA 4.
Quasi vero nos ea quae Providentiae futura esse prenoscit non esse eventura
credamus, ac non illud potius arbitremur: Quod licet eveniant nihil tamen ut
evenirent sua natura necessitatis habuisse, quod hinc facile perpendere licet:
Plura etenim dum fiant subjecta oculis intuemur: ut ea quae in quadragis
moderandis, at que flectendis facere spect^ntur aurigae atque ad hunc modum
certe aguntur, Number igitur quicquam illorum ita fieri necessitas ulla compellit,
frustra esset artis effectus si omnia coicte moverentur, quae igitur cum fiunt
carent existendi necessitate eadem priusquam fiunt sine necessitate futura
sunt, quare sunt quaedam eventura quorum exitus ab omni necessitate sint
absolutae. Nam illud quidem nullum arbitror esse dicturum quod quae nunc fiunt
prius quam fierent esse eventura non fuerint, nam sicut scientia praesentium
rerum nihil istis sit cum fiunt ita praescientia futurorum nihil his quae
futura sunt necessitatis importat.

Erroris causa est quod omnia quae quisque novit ex ipsorum vi atque natura
cognosciaestimat quae sciuntur quod rationi contrarium est: omne enim quod
cognoscitur non secundum sui vim sed secundum cognoscentium potius
comprehenditur facultatem, nam ut hoc brevi liqueat exemplo eandem corporis
rotunditatem aliter visus, aliter tactus agnoscit, ille eminus totum (scil.)
jactis radiis intuetur hic vero cohaerens orbi atque conjunctus circa ipsum
motus ambitum rotunditatem partibus comprehendit, ipsum quoque hominem aliter
sensus, aliter imaginatio, aliter ratio, aliter intelligentia contuetur, sensus
figuram in subjecta materia constitutam, Imaginatio solam sine materia judicat
figuram, ratio hanc quoque transcendit, speciemque ipsam quae singularibus
inest universali consideratione perpendit: Intelligentiae celsior oculus
existit, and super gres^^one facta universitatis ambitum and ipsam illam
simplicem forman purae mentis acic contuetur.

PROSA 6.
Aeternitas est, in terminabilis vitae tota simul and perlecta possessio.

Nota quod in verbo vitae, omnia quae snot ejus vitae comprehenduntur scilicet
potentia, scientia, sapientia, gaudium complacentia, etc.

Quid igitur postulas, ut necessaria fiant quae divino lumine lustrantur cum ne
homines quidem necessaria faciant esse quae videant. Number enim quae presentia
cernis aliquam eis necessitatem addit intuitus, at qui si est divini humanique
presentis digna collatio sicut vos hoc temporario presenti quaedam videtis ita
ille divino suo aeterne cerneret, sed duae sunt necessitates, simplex una
veluti quod necesse est omnes homines esse mortales: Altera conditionis ut si
aliquem ambulare scies cum am^ulare necesse sit, quod quis novit id esse aliter
ac notum est nequit.

Fiunt productio ne cuncta quae futura D^us esse prenoscit, sed quaedam de
libero arbitrio sunt, quae quamvis eveniant exinde tamen naturam propriam non
amittunt.

Commentariolum tuum Domine inquies lector uti sit non video notae quaedam and
scholi, tantum cernuntur. Imo Lector dispositio and ordinatio sententiarum
Boethanarum naturam aliquid loco commentarii faciunt, magis enim ad ipsum
Lectoris intellectum reddit Boethius. Ipse sed quoniam Commentariolum meum ita
efflagitus, accipe super hos versus:

Tu triplicis mediam naturae cuncta moventem,
Connectans animam per consona membra resolvis, etc.
Hos versus and qui sequntur sic secundum mentem Boethianam interpretari
licebit, and completa erit veritas little, anima haec triplicis naturae est
anima Christi. Dei and hominis, media anima etiam est inter Deum and hominem.
Deus ille erat cuncta movens ab aeterno and tempus abaevo movere jubebat, per
cum omnia sunt facta quae fuirunt facta and sine eo nihili. Per consona membra
resolvis etc. Adaptasti corpus animae educta a Marla Virgin vi Spiritus Sancti
and obumbrationem ejus Sanctum illud quod non vidit corruptionem internam vel
externam Cabalistae habent 7. Sepheroth p^imus eorum est Trinus: Intelligenria,
Sapientia Energia seu amor activus: Sapientia est hic noster persona and media,
filius intelligentiae, a quibus spiritus seu amor activus, procedit.

Quae dum secta duos motum glomeravit in orbs,
In semet reditura meat mentemque profundam
Circuit etc.
Secta, id est, inter divinam and humanam naturam nam in perfectione habet
utramque and ratio tantum dividit inter ea and sunt ratione tantum divisa re
nunquam. Non per mortem Christi licet anima humana vire a corpore per spitium
trium dierum divisa fuit.

In semet reditura meat etc. Circul non scil facit co^pletum in reflexione sui
ipsius, mentemque profundam Circuit, etc. id est dietatis, and quis hoc potuit
nisi Christus Jesus, sed Circulus hic internus and per reflexum mutuumque
amorem and complacentiam est.

Et simili convertit imagine Coelum similima certe imagine circumgirat Coelum
vocatum Primum Mobile. Haec interpraetatio uti reor salva fide Catholica and
orthodoxa est and ex nulla part inconveniens fieri potest.

Laus Deo Trino and Gloria in ^ternum. Quae addenda sunt non crunt loco
commentarii sed superstructurae quaedam necessariae, non ex naturae and
Philosophiae puteis sed ex font limpidissimo scripturarum exhaustae.

Ipse Boethius ut refert Author Commentarii in librum sequentem Boethianum ex
literatorum relationes de Trinitate quaedam locutus erat quae adjicienda essent
libris de Consolatione, sed quoniam amissae sunt de eis nihil certum statui
possit.

Nos in superstructuris nunc operam impend^mus, and primo de altiore scientia
non enim intuitiva and instans tantum est in deo scientia, sed ut omnisciens
est ita omnimodum habet, scientiam and ex se and in se.

Scientiam habet perspectivam prospiciens omn a, videt onim omnia quae fecerat
and erant valde bona, and ^aec visio prospectiva erat intuitiva est interna
scientia, perspectiva autem rerum ad extra, deus enim recolligit prospectum ad
extra and eum ad internam, ideam sive insitam summi fo^mam boni reducit and in
illa universali idea omnia perspecta ad extra revocantur, haec est vera and
divina Philosophia summeque metaphysica.

Satis antea de malo and peccato dictum est, sed de ira and exscandescentia Dei
parum aut nihil, de illis itaque aliquid dicendum. Haec autem est vis and
virtus punitaria in Deo, sed sine passione and altercatione more humano D. us
irasci aut excandescere dicitur. Notandum etiam quod adeo obstrusa and
recondita sunt haec in natura Dei, eo quod nihil nisi peccatum haec potuit
educere; ipse amor and bonitas nihil nisi amabile and bonum proferre potuit:
malum hoc ergo ut ante dictum, nihil est eo quod qui omnia potest illud non
potest facere, aliquid autem de malo considerandum ut antea, propter hoc quod
justam vindictam Dei postulat; sed de his satis, and n^hil sicut spero
superfluum,

Nunc de lapsu hominis aliquid dicendum per quod mors in mundum intravit, super
omnes homines and triumphavit poenas infernales, and aeternas introduxit.

De Redemptione etiam Christi Jesu multa dicenda sunt, and cognitu necessaris,
amor enim ipsius humano generi jam lapso exprimi non potest: non dico tamen,
quamvis vere dici potest, faelix peccatum quod talem meruit Redemptorem, sed
potius infaelix peccatum quod tale onus humeris suis imposuit and quidem talis
and tanti Redemptoris, qui crucem ligneam impositam humeris ipsius habnit, sub
qua succubuit, non tale onus imposuerunt milites multis gradibus excedat onus
peccatorum quod ipse Jesus tulit, cum enim Simon crucem ligneam ejus onere
vacuum, bajulabat, leviter praeterit crux enim illa lignea vacua fuit oneris
peccatorum, sed ipse Christus, illud peccatorum onus and Torcular irae and
vindictae summi D^i, solus ipse tulit.

Mirabilis cerie est ejus Incarnatio mirabilia sua omnia quae sustinuit and
fecit in carne, si dicturus eram; eorum numerus Caput and Cap^um meum; super
grederetur numerum citius stellarum indicarem aut arenas Maris numerarem omnia
quae fecerat Deus ille and Salvator Noster ad gloriam and immortalitatem
nostram efficient, cujus nomini sit Laus and Gloria in aeternum: Sed
observandum est quod licet Deus and homo fuerat Christus ideoque ab omnibus
adorandus, nunquam tamen quamdiu fuerat in terris prostrationem tulit, in via
status humiliationis suae. Imo nec post resurrectionem ejus admisit Mariae enim
dixit quum cum adorare vellet, Noli me tangere nondum enim ascendi; ultima pars
ejus humiliationis erat in terris per quadragin^a dies quiescens mora.

Nunc autem venite exultimus Domino, jubilemus Deo Salvatori nostro.
Veniamus ante faciem ejus gratias dantes and latemur in eo cantantes Psalmos.
Magnus enim est Deus noster, and Rex magnus super omnes Deos.
Venite adoremus and prostramus and flectemus gen^a ante Dominum and refectorem
nostrum, quoniam misericordia ejus extendit se usque ad Coelum, and veritas
ejus usque ad nubes, and aquas supra coelestes quae universum circumgirant
conamine enim eorum tendunt ad Centrum and cum non descendere permittuntur per
primum Mobile se movent and secundum motum eorum movetur primum Mobile,

Mentemque profundam Circuit, etc. Qualis est hic Circuitus, Internus certe,
nam neque ipse Deus Circuere seipsum potest, nam sic extra se esset quod est
impossible and implicat contradictionem and Circuens erit major Circuito.
Quanto minus possunt res Creatae quae non mentem prosundam possunt Circuitu
interno complecti. Sic enim Deo aequiparatentur quod etiam foret impossible.
Absit itaque quod quisquam diceret mentem creatam aliquo modo posse mentem
divinam Circuire: Thomas autem hoc dicit non ergo sic explicatur Boethius sed
obscuratur.

Nunc de aeternitate Dei loquendum, sciendum etiam est quod licet Deus sit
aeternus, est etiam perpetuo durabili: Qui est, qui erat, and qui venturus est,
quam ultimam particulam potius reddendum esse censeo per haec verba qui
perpetuo est duraturus, nam haec verba qui venturus est aliquantu^um in
aeternitatem impingunt: Scientia etiam ejus perspectum habet in duratione
rerum, Reflexum etiam in ea quae fuerunt. His premissis nunc de Deo salvatori
nostro u^terius dicendum, a quo sola Beatio nostra and faelicitas dependit.
Ipse confratres and cohaeredes aeternitatis nos secumveat, Hic est veritas and
vita, Atque ita inquit Boethius noster.

Te Cernere finis.

Principium Vector Dux semita terminus idem.

Quisquis igitur faelicitatem vel precatur vel optat hunc sequi ducem necessum,
est ipse enim est Lumen illuminans universumque, ipse fons omnis bonitatis and
beatitudinis, Ipse Salvator and Redemptor qui super mortem and Gehennam
triumphavit, Ipse preparavit nobis mantiones aeternus in Coelis, and in nova
Jerusalem, utque in facie ejus videbimus Deum ad vitam^^ternam.

Da Pater Augustum mente conscendere sedem.
Da sontem lustrare bonis da luce reperta,
In te conspicuos animi desigere visus.
Te Cernere finis.

Principium Vector, Dux, semita, terminus Idem.

Uoum maxim notandum quod cum Salvator noster esset sapientia Patris, se tamen
adeo humiliavit cum parvulis and infantibus commercium habere voluit and ulnis
suis eos recepit and manus suas eis imposuit and benedixit eis, and dixit
Sinite parvulos venire ad me nam illorum est regnum: si illorum sit regnum,
illorum est Spiritus Sanctus, nam sine Spiritu nemo intrat Regnum, si Spiritus
illorum sit, quare aquam baptismi iis denegetis? Quomodo aquam denegate
possitis quum aeque vobiscum Spiritum Sanctum receperunt, O duri infantum
soceri Anabaptistae qui nec baptizare nec in baptismo Infantes permanere
sinitis sed copiosam illam redemptionem rejicitis, and baptisinum ejuratis
Diabolus ab Auruspicibus suis nihil magis requirit: J am vero totum hoc opus
fere expedivi, unicum tantum restit quod a Thoma exhaurias. and breviarum est
quinque librorum ordine digestum quod and Latino and Anglico Sermon tenemus,
and proculdubio optime sonat ejus commentarium, and si nihil fecisset ulterius
perbelle a se factum esset.

Tu Provehis causis animos vitasque minores. Si qua vera Philosophia ex his
elicere posset prompte proferam si non Platonicam dimittam falsitatem, quae
apud eos raro evenit. Nam propemodum veraces sunt P^atonici and ex maxima part
vera loquuntur.

Tu provehis seu promoves causis animas vitusque minores, id est vegetativas
and sensitivas, rationales excipe, and vere haec sonant.

Et Levions sublimes curribus aptans,
in coelum terramque serio.
In hoc etiam nihil falsi reperio, sed pro his quae sequuntur meam non possum
dare sententiam.

Quas lege benigna.

Ad te Conversus reduci facis igne reverti Immortalitatem brutorum and Arborum
vix patior immortalitati enim animarum humanarum praejudicat, licet autem
falsum sit nihil tamen inconvenientiae ulterius ponit.

O qui perpetua mundum ratione gubernas, etc.

O thou who with perpetual reason govern'st
This World, Maker of Earth and Heaven for ever blessed,
Who do from aye make time proceed to all past motion,
Thy self still standing firm, not pressed with the devotion
Of outward causes to frame the flued matter
Of which Philosophers so vainly chatter,
But by blessed Ideal form, no ways envying,

Dear Father let my mind thy glorious seat ascend,
Let me behold the spring of gra^e, and find the light,
That I on that may six my souls well ^l^ered sight,

To pious m n, whose end is to behold thy Ray,
Who art their first, Conveigher, Guide their last, and way.
I will make use of the Translator in all that follows in verse.

He that would seek the truth with thought profound,
And would not stray in ways which are not right,
He to himself must turn his inward sight,
And guide his motions in a circled round,
Teaching his mind what ever she design
Her self in her own Treasure does possess;
So that which late lay hid in cloudiness,
More bright and clear then Phoebus beams shall shine.
Flesh has not quenched all the spirits light,
Though this oblivious lump holds her possessed,
Some seed of truth remains in our breast,
Which skillful Learning easily does excite.
For being ask't, how can we answer true,
Unless that grace within our hearts did dwell,
If Plato's heavenly Muse the truth does tell,
We learning things remember them a new?
Lib. 5. MET. 3.
What cause of discord breaks the bonds of love?
What God betwixt two truths such wars does me,
That things which severally well settled be,
Yet joined in one will never friendly prove,
Or in true things can we no discord see,
Because all certainties do still agree;
But our dull soul covered with members blind
Knows not the secret Law which things do bind,
By the drowned light of her oppressed fire,
Why then the hidden Notes to find
Does she with such a love of truth desire,
If she knows that which she does so require.
Why wishes she known things to know again?
If she knows not, why strives she with blind pain?
Who after things unknown will strive to go?
Or will such ignorant pursuit maintain?
How shall she find them out? or having so,
How shall she then their forms and natures know?
Or when this soul the highest mind did view,
Must we needs say, that it all natures knew?
Now she, though clouds of flesh do her debar,
Forgets not all that was her ancient due,
But in her mind some general notions are,
Though not the skill of things particular.
He that seeks truth in neither course does fall,
Not knowing all, nor ignorant of all;
He marketh general things which he retains,
And, matters seen on high, does back recall,
And things forgotten to his mind regains,
And joins them to that part that there remains.
Laurentius Valla Gramaticus vocat Boethium eruditorum ultimum, non ordine aut
gradu sed tempore, tum enim Gothi and Vandali in Romanam ditionem irruptionem
fecerunt cum Theodoricus erat Imperator, Boethius autem Romanorum eruditissimus
eju^aetatis, vel a retro per multos annos fuit ut opera ejus testantur.

Ancients in Schools once too obscurely taught,
That sense and shape presented to the thought
From outward object, their impression take,
As when a paper smooth and plain,
On which, as yet, the marks of Ink has layne,
We with a nimble pen do letters make.
But if our mind to nothing can apply
Their proper motions, but do patient lie
Subject to forms which do from bodies flow,
Like to a Glass, rendering the shape of things;
Who then can show from whence that motion springs?
By force of which the mind all things does know.
Or by what skill are several things espied?
And being known, what power does them divide,
And thus divided does again unite,
And with a various journey often aspires
To highest things, and often again retires
To basest, nothing being out of sight.
And when she back unto her self does move,
Does all the falsehoods by the truth reprove?
This vigor needs must be an active cause,
And with more powerful forces must be decked,
Then that which from these forms that do reflect
From outward matter all her virtue draws,
And yet in living bodies passions might
Does go before, whose office is to wait,
And the first motions in the mind do make,
As when the light unto our eyes appears,
Or some loud voice is sounded in our ears,
Then does the strength of the dull mind aw^ke
Those Fantasies which she retains within,
She stirs up such motions to begin,
Whose objects with their natures best agree;
And thus applying them to outward things,
She joins th'externall shapes with those she brings,
With forms which in her self included be.
THE LIFE and DEATH OF Anicius Manlius Torquatus Severinus Boethius.
Taken out of Peter Bertius, and Jul. Martianus Rota.
ANicius Severinus Boethius was a Roman, one eminent both by the Nobility of
his Ancestors, and the endowments of his soul. His life befell him in those
times when Italy was held and oppressed by the Barbarians. For he was borne not
long after Rome was taken by Aleric, and flourished in King Theodoricks time.
This Theodorick being assisted by Zeno with many thousands, took to himself
Italy after he had taken it away from Odoacer, and planted his Kingly seat at
Ravenna, doing what ever him listed; which Boethius well seeing, he applied his
mind to honest studies. Being therefore well skilled in Greek and Latin
learning, he first translated something out of Euclide, and to them added some
things of his own. And that which was not f^und in Aristotle's age, he taught
to make a Square equal to a Circle. And he rendered in Latin Nichomacus
Arithmetic, not as a bare interpreter, but as one that knew how to do it in
the best manner. Then Music a most perplexed and inturned Art, was collected
by him out of the best; in which he gave a full expression of Aristoxenis and
Pythagoras. There is extant an Epistle of Theodorick to Boethius, which shows,
that he translated into Latin both Ptolemies Syntaxis, and Archymedes his
Mechanic. He shows in his own words that he intended to translate
Aristotle, what ever of Aristotle's works shall come to my hands, I will turn
them into the Roman style and Language, Every little of them will I make to
speak Latin, that what ever shall be of the subtilty of Logic of the Prudens
of the morals and whatsoever is set down by Aristotle out of the quick ingeny
of the Natural, all that will I ordinately transfer and illustrate with a
cle^r light of Commentation.

He explained that Porphery whom Cornelius Apher after had translated in a
compe^dious manner, and illustrated the same with new Expositions. As Soon as he
had put his hand to the Predicaments, behold he was made Consul of Rome; this
he expresses in his own words. And although the cares of the Consular Office
do hinder me, by which means I cannot employ all my vacancies and my full
industry in these studies, yet it seems to pertain to some part of the care of
the Commonwealth to instruct the Citizens in any elucubrate part of learning.
Nor shall I deserve ill of my fellow Citizens, seeing the ancient virtue of men
of the other Cities have transferred the Empire and Government to this only
Commonwealth, I to that alone which is left may instruct the mode of our City
in the Arts of the Greek Wisdom. Therefore this is not impertinent to the
Consular Office, seeing it has been always the custom of Rome, that in what
Nation soever that which was the most fair and excellent to make that more and
more splendent by immitation. Thus he. But he came to be Consul a young man, by
the favor of the chief of the City, for they took the charge of him being a
Boy, being they knew he was from the ancient family of the Manlii Torquati,
and saw the ingenuity of the Anician great Grandfather budding in him. In his
first Consulate the King of the Huns and Italy Odoacer, by Pheba the Captain of
the Rugi, he was taken and possessed and enjoyed as C^ssi^dore relates, who
names Boethius only but twice, Consul once with Symachus. And he not only
obtained this honor, but his two sons, which had never before happened, he saw
Patricius and Hyparius at the same time Consuls. That very year Theodorick
being called to the Court at Rome in the name of S. P. Q. R. Boethius made a
Panegyric with the highest eloquence in Theodoricks praise, betwixt the two
Consuls, when he made a triumphall feast to the multitude.

In his last Consulate he had to colleague Symachus his Father in Law.

A sore famine oppressed Campania, and above all, a more bitter levy and
exaction was demanded by the Tyrants Exactors, which this Consul would not
suffer to be gathered.

Peter Bertius says, there were diverse who wrote upon the Books de
Consolatione: to wit, of the more ancient Albertus Magnus, and Tho. Aquinas;
after them Rodolphus Agricola Frisius Joannes Murmellius, Ruremontanus, and
nuper admodum Joannes Bernartius and Theodorus Zitzmannus. This Book was
lately by me read upon in my public Lectures in the Academy. It appears
evidently that Philip the fair (the French King) did so highly esteem these
Books, that though he well understood the Latin, yet he took it as a benefit
at the hands of John Magdunensis or Mouns the Poet, who dedicated to his Name
his French Translation of it. This Book was written in the Prison of Ticinum,
where afterward Boethius lost his head.

There were more Boethiuses then this one. One Laertius names, that was a
Stoic. Another Plutarch names, who was an Epicurean. A third cited by Galen, a
Certian, a Studier of Aristotle, a Consular man. And our Boethius names a
fourth in his Comment upon Porphyry anciently cited by Amonicus and Symplicius.
A fifth was Boethius his own Father.

Our Boethius his first name is taken from the Anicii, the antiquity and
nobleness of whose name S. Hierom not in one place alone sets forth. The most
eminent of the Anicii was Boethius his great Grandfather, Anicius Sextus
Petronius Probus, of whom there is frequent mention in Amianus Marcellinus,
Ausonius, Symachus, and in the Code of Theodosian, Claudian doubts not to
prefer this Anisius before all the Romans then living, for his Nobility.

Quemcunque requiris (inquit.)
Haec de stirpe virum, certum est de consule nasci
Per fasces numerantur Avi, semperque renata
Nobilitate virent, and prolem Fata sequuntur,
Nec quisquam procerum tentat licet aere vetusto
Floreat, and claro cingatur Roma Senatu.
Se jactare parem.
Quia Manlii gens Torquata erat eo factum est ut noster Boethius dictus fuerat
Torquatus. But how our Boethius came to be named Severinus it seems to be
doubtful; some draw it from the severity of the Manlian family, to which I
cannot assent; for though I find many of th^^t family to have been abundantly
severe, yet I find none of them to be named either Severi or Severine.
Therefore I had rather ascribe it to the name of the Family of the Severines.
And indeed there were many of that name and family Consuls under the Emperors
Leo and Zeno. It may be Manlia the daughter of Theodorus was married to a
Severyne, the Grandfather of our Boechius. Our Boethius was born the same year
his Father was killed, to wit, the year of our Lord ^55. I do not doubt but
the praenomen or first name of Boethius was Flavius. For I find in the
Ecclesiastical acts these words Fl: Boethii V.C. Consule die 3. Iduum Martiarum
in Basilica Constantiana residente venerabili viro Papa Felice etc. which words
are to be referred to Boethius his first Consulship. Boethius was borne the
year of our Lord Boethius bestowed 11 years at Athens, that he bestowed 11
years there, his Book de Disciplina Scibolarium confirms it.

The first Wife he married was Elpis a Sicilian, a noble Virgin, by whom he had
two sons, Patricius and Hypatius. Of her making it is believed the two Hymns
Aurea lux and faelix per omnia were, which are now sung in the Church.

The first Consulat was the 487. year of Christ before Theodorick came to the
Kingdom of Italy 2 years. His sons Patritius and Hypatius were Confuls 13 years
after him, which was the year of our Lord 500. Boethius his second Consulat was
the year of our Lord 510. of Theodoricks 18. He had a Library full fraught with
Books of all Languages, whose wall shone with Ivory and glass.

With this fullness being instructed, Boethius did intend to ^l^ustrate all
Philosophy in the Latin tongue, for thus he writes. For I turn every work of
Aristotle which shall come to my hand into the Roman Style; will write out all
of them in the Latin speech; that whatsoever of his, either subtlety of
Logic, for the skill of moral gravity, or the shortness of natural verity,
made transparent, by Aristotle, all that I will ordinately transfer and
illustrate, with some kind of light and commentary.

These things he with much labor in unisall Philosophy, did turn either out
of the Greek, or himself write in Latin.

In Logic these things.

Arithmeticke: this amongst the Greeks Nicomachus did diligently expound whom
first Maudacensis Apuleius, and then the magnificent man Boethius did give to
the Romans translated in the Latin speech. Of Arithmeticke, two books.

In Music he translated Pythagoras the Musician: he writ of Music 5 books.

In Geometry he translated Euclide; Cassiodore speaking of Geometry, whose
discipline he says among the Greeks Euclide, Apollonius, Archimedes, and also
other writers to be observed who are extant, of which the magnificent man
Boethius did give in the Roman tongue; who if he be diligently read, that
which of Divisions before said is apparent, shall be known by manifest
understanding and clear truth.

He writ upon the Geometry of Euclide, three books Of the quadrature of the
Circle.

In Geography and Astronomy he translated Ptolomeus Alexandrinus

In the Mathematics he translated Archimedes his Mecanicks.

Besides these he put forth Plato turned by him. Epistles to diverse 1 book.

Also he attempted the concord of the Philosophy of Aristotle with Plato.

Of weeks 1 book.

I might believe even at Rome, that either extraordinarily he taught some noble
young men, or did oversee some others that taught them; did institute various
exercises of all sapientes, at his own house; for Rome was then excellent in
all learning and Philosophy and humane discipline, as may be seen out of the
rescript of Theodorick the King, to Symachus, Boethius his Father in Law, in
which he calls Rome the Mother of eloquence, and the large Church of all
virtue, lest the Valri^n children that came from the Syracusan City for the
cause of study to Rome, without consulting with him or his knowledge should
return to their Father.

Boethius was very busy in Translations and writing Books when Elpis his
dear Wife was taken away by death. A faithful Companion of his cares, joys,
and studies. Her Epitaph uncertain whether written by Boethius or some other,
such as it is, is thus read.

Elpis dicta fuit Siculae regionis alumna
Quem procul Patria conjugis egit amor
Quo sine maesta dies nox afraflebilis hora.
Porticibus sacris jam nunc peregrina quiesco,
Judicis aeternt testificata Vironum.
Elpis being dead, Boethius married a second Wise, Rusticena the daughter of
Symachus, a Senator and Consular man, by whom he had two sons. After this comes
Boethius his last Consular, which he bore with Symachus his Father in law, the
year of our Lord 522. and of his own age 67. Unto Symachus the Senators of new
Rome, to Boethius the Senators of old Rome, gave the Consular. To this Symachus
Boethius inscribed a Book made by him of the holy Trinity, against Nestorius
and Eutiches. For Boethius was specially studied in Theology, and at that time
the more diligent, because he saw Orthodox sentence of the holy Trinity to be
opposed vehemently, by the Arrian Eastern Goths and Theodorick their King;
Therefore he wrote of the Unity of the Trinity, whether the Father, Son, and
Holy Ghost do predicate substantially of the Divinity. Moreover of the Faith
to John the Deacon, of the two natures in Christ. But Boethius having put out
those Works, did excite the hatred of Theodorick the King, and raised a
suspicion in him, that he intended to change the Commonwealth to vindicate its
liberty. Nor were there men wanting, who upon this occasion did oppose openly
upon this point, and did oppose openly his Consular authority, to which
Boethius enjoying a good conscience valiantly opposed himself, and was not
afraid for the defending of the Commonwealth and private Citizens right to
undertake the enmity of great men. Then he represt Conigastus the exactor who
invaded wickedly the fortunes of the miserable Citizens. Nor did he that once
only in his Consulship, but often. After that Triguilla the Prefect, or Steward
of the Kings house, he called back from his begun, and now almost perfected
injury.

Boethius complained to Theodorick of the undoing of the Provinces by the
rapines of the Prefects and public Levies. In the famine of Campania and other
intolerable exactions, by which it was almost ruined, he for the common good
had a combat with the Prefect of the Pretorians, and the King himself knowing
of it, he contended vehemently for Campania, and by the force of his Oratory
he effected the prohibition of that coemption.

These things being don by Boethius in the time of his Consulat when the hate
of the King and his Courtiers were inflamed. The next year Maximus being
Consul, he was accused by Basilius Opilius and Gaudentius, men most
flagitiously wicked, and (because of the Kings example, they followed the most
impious tenent of Arrius) most bitterly against the Orthodox: Amongst these
Basilius who had been discharged from the Kings service, being very much
indebted in hope of the Kings favor he accused Boethius, but Opilio and
Gaudentius who for many heinous crimes were destined to banishment, defended
themselves by Sanctuary (although the King had made an edict, that if they
departed not within their appointed day from Ravenna, they should be pulled out
from the Temple, they should be driven out with burnt marks in their forehead.
Yet when they professed the accusation of Boethius, that very day designed for
their Banishment, they were admitted, heard, and received into the Kings
favor, and restored to their pristine dignity.

The sum of his accusation, or rather delation, was, because Boethius wished
all well to the Senate and its Authority. That he opposed the Delator, lest he
should bring Instruments by which he should prove the Senate guilty of high
Treason. That he endeavored the restiuition of the Roman Empire, to the
confirmation of which head, they produced Letters, as written by Boethius, when
they were forged by themselves. They said also that Boethius through the
ambition of dignity had polluted his conscience with sacrilege. Theodorick the
King, who had before born himself moderate to the Orthodox, from this very
time began to be cruel; so that believing in such feigned things, so that he
condemned Boethius unguilty, than whom to him there was not another more
beloved and lovely: and having declared all his Goods forfe it, he sent him to
the Prison of Ticinum (which the later men call Papia) 500 mile from the City.

In this Prison (according to the example of Socrates) he first wrote a Book
an Apology and Defense; and there also he wrote a Book to Symachus of the
Trinity. He did not perfect his work de Consolatione; for I have most
certain arguments by which I can evince, that the purpose of Boethius was to
add those things out of the Christian Doctrine, that the mind might be the
most exalted in the consideration of eternal life. And take it for last.

Himself proposing these Philosophical things, does promise some other things
more high and excellent than those. Add to these that which he says in his 4.
Book, he calls Philosophy the passable way to true light, therefore he means
not to make a full stop in that part, but to go on forward to the greater
light. I had thought now to have stepped from Bertius, and to have returned to
Martianus Rota; but finding Bertius more punctual and significant in
describing the life of Boethius, I shall proceed with him first.

In the Prison of Ticinum Boethius lost his head the year of our Lord 526. of
Theodoricks reign 34. of his own life 71. The Citizens buried his body in S.
Peter's Church, under the golden Heaven in S. Augustines Chapel, where the
ascent begins.

His Epitaph.
Maeoniae and Latiae linguae clarissimus etqui
Consul eram hic perii missus in exiliam,
Sed quem mors rapiut probitas evexit ad aura^,
Et nunc fama viget maxima, viget opus.
After his death Amalisuenta Theodoricks daughter, the Mother of Ahalerick, the
Widow of Eutharicus erected all the Satua's of Boethius that were levelled in
Rome, and restored to his Heirs the whole patrimony. Also Theodebate the King
to whom Amalisuenta his sister promoted to the Crown as it is with Cassiodore
l. 10. Epist. 11. called one Maximus one of the Anician family to the dignity
of the Primiceriat, and he took a Wife of the Kingly stock.

To conclude 270 years after, to wit, in the year of our Lord 996. Otho the
3. Augustus took the bones out of the Sepulcher: in which those of Boethius had
layn hid, and removed them, and exalted them to a marble Tomb. In memory of
which act, Gerbertus is, that having abandoned the Arch Bishopric of Rhemes;
betook himself to the Bishopric of Ravenna, and last of all was Pope of Rome,
by the name of Sylvester the second, made this Verse at that time.

Roma potens dum jura sua declarat in orb
Tu Pater and Patriae lumen Severine Boethi
Consulis officio rerum dispones habenas,
Infundis lumen studiis and cedere nescis
Graecorum ingeniis: sed men's divina coercet
Imperium mundi gladio bacchante Gothorum
Libertas Romana perit Tu Consul and exul
Insignes titulos praeclara morte relinquis,
Nunc decus imperii summas qui praegravat arts,
Tertius Otho suum sua dignum te judicat aula,
Aeternumque tui statuit monumenta laboris,
Et been pro meritum meritis exornat honestis.
To the five Books de Consolatione, if a sixth h^d been added of eternal life,
we had had a consummate consolation against all the evils of this life.

I now come again to Martianus Rota. Tycinum was a City placed amongst the
Insubrians, now Savoyards.

Boethius in writing his Books, consulted the best Authors, to wit,
Theophrastus Eudemus, Andronicus, Aspatius, Herminius, Alexander, Syrianus,
Porphyrius, Themistius, of whose opinions, as an honorary Arbitrator, he gave
his dicision.

He himself attests this in his Exposition on Aristotle's book de Enuntiatione,
in the 3. of which books when on the manner of Contingents, he there declares,
that he had written better of them in his Physics. Thereupon he gives us
occasion to conjecture, that he left also enucleations over natural
Philosophy.

But hitherto these Books are missing, though they have been brought lately to
Tarvisium as well as those which he wrote on the Analyticks and Topics, seeing
that he himself cytes these. And upon the Topics of Cicero he wrote seven
Books, as himself professes. He also takes upon him to Latinize Plato's
Dialogues, that they were done, Cassiodore affirms. I should wonder at the
multitude and largeness of these Works, but that I know that those divine
Commentaries upon Aristotle's Book de Interpretatione was done by him in two
years, which time would scarce serve to turn over so many Commentators as
wrote upon it. For among the Peripateticks, there is scarce one famous that
has not written upon that Book: Boethius Commented upon this Book when
Theodorick passed the Alps, and overthrew his Father in law Clodoveus, or Lewis
the French King in a great battle. Boethius wrote 4 excellent Books of Topical
differences, by which he dissevers the Logic from the Rhetoric, and as many
more of both Sylogisms. Also of Division and on each 1. That which is the
Introduction to the Categoricall Sylogisme is falsely inscribed with the Books
of Aristotle of the Eununciation. For either it is a Breviary, as he calls it,
or certainly the same with the first upon the Categoricall Sylogism. And that
Work de Disciplina Scholarium, belies not only the title, but also the
elocution and invention. For Boethius would have written otherwise; but let
that alone, and let us bring somewhat of his Weeks to light. The Work of the
Weeks is distributed into 7 parts. Varro first wrote upon the Weeks, and then
our Author, out of which the little Book of the good of substance, or
substantial good, and that other of the Unity, or One, are taken. He composed
the Weeks a young man, as also of that on the two Natures and one person of
Christ. Upon the Commotions of the Acephali there was an handle or holdfast
given to our Boethius to compose a Book against Nestorius, who joined to the
two Natures as many persons, and against Eutiches, who allowed but one Nature
and one person.

The Inhabitants of Tycinum do always constantly assever this tradition from
their Ancestors, that our Severyne when he was mortally wounded by the Kings
Darter, to have carried up his irrased head with both hands, and being asked of
whom he thought he was wounded? answered, by the impious, and so when he came
into the neighboring Church, and with ^ended knees had received the holy
things of the After, expired presently after. Being dead, he obtained Sainting
honors amongst ours, because he suffered death because he maintained the
Catholic Doctrines against the perfidies of the Ar^ian.

He had an Eulogy besides his Epitaph before recited, before he was quietly
laid, by Luitprandus King of the Lumbards.

Ecce Boethus adest in Coelo magnus, and omni
Perspectus mundo, mirus habendus homo
Qui Theodorico Regi delatus iniquo
Ticini senium duxit in exilio,
In quase maestum solans dedit urbe libellum
Post ictus gladio exiit e medio.
I cannot omit what is said of Symachus the Colleague, and Father in Law of
Boethius, of them two remembered by my present Author Marianus Rota. There were
two of the Symachi of great estimation for learning each of them; the first
lived in Gracian and Valerians, the last in the times of Zeno and Anastasius;
his Epistles are extant, and in esteem carried about by many, and he is often
mentioned in Macrobius his Saturnals. Of this other there is nothing, but to
pretermit the testimony of Boethius. Priscian of Caesarea writing of weights,
does so commend him, that he does appear thereby to have attained all the tops
of all Disciplines.

And now I shall close all with Rota's Eulogy. This was the end of this
excellent man, who for eloquence, honesty, and learning, did very much excel.
The last of all the Romans who did consecrate any thing to literatures
monuments; the first of all who did illustrate Aristotle in the Latin tongue.
Of so great authority with posterity, that there was almost no appeal from his
sentences. By his death we lost Plato and Aristotle's Concordance, which he
promised, and had done, if not cut off by violent and immature death, and he
only could do it.

But the revenge, or rather vengeance, stayed not long inflicted by Gods hand.
For Theodorick supping when a fishes head was set before him, the King thought
he saw in that, Symachus his face biting his nether lip, and with fierce eyes
threatening; being struck with the spectacle, the Tyrant fell into a sickness,
and as soon as he confessed what he had seen, expired. His families divulged
his death to be by a bloody stroke. But Amalasiunta knowing well the thing,
when she succeeded in the Kingdom, rescinds all her Fathers acts done against
Law and right, and restored all Severynes and Symachus his Goods to their
children.

I Am glad to hear it from Bellarmin that Aquinas was not the Author of that
unhappy Commentary that goes under his name upon Boethius. But sure that
Commentator was ancient, for I have him printed above an hundred years since. I
wish we had the right Aquinas and Albert^^ Magnus, for these latter
Commentators understand him not, and are mere Mountebancks; else I wish we
had Bertius his Lectures upon him.

I should be glad that some man would find out a convenient sense for those
Verses of Boethius, if mine do not altogether please them; for I put no
obligation upon any man to follow me.

Tu triplicis medium naturae cuncta moventem
Connectens Animam per Consona membra resolvis
Quae dum secta duos motum glomeravit in orbs,
In semet reditura meat mentemque profundam,
Circuit, etc.
And therefore I add this to my former interpretation and say, this Circuitus
mentis profundi sive Divini, may perhaps mean no more than the intuitive
comprehension of the Ideal form in the mind of God, by which the Heavens are
turned round. And this sense is facile and easy, and then this Anima triplicis
naturae and media, may well be the soul of man, without any danger of error or
blasphemy. And the foolish opinion of Anima mundi, or intelligentia movens
orbem, may be discarded and exploded.

substantialem ex lumbis propriis superfuturam, claritatis and nominis
continuationem, imo ut videas filios filiorum and pacem and religione^^,
proseripiam in terra hac nostra Anglicana, restitutam and denuo reslorescentem
Viteriores sunt mibi supplicationes quas loqui non licet, nec dum convenit,
licebit autem posthac Deo volente iubenceque.

Namque dabit Deus his quoque finem. Sed quanta est tibi mei cura, vir
literatissime, and fame ut non sinas Boethiana mea praelo mandari, sine
circumspactione ^ua and judicio? Sed ve mibi, impresse sunt aliquae schaedae ut
mihi videtur, non been excusae. Et ni ocius remittas mibi chartas meas male
exaratas, opus finitum ^rit priusquam a ter recipiam eas, quod d^l^ncer dico.
Sed hoc magnopere flagito, quod cum jam innotuit tibi ubi sit translatio illa
optima (matri tuae optimae dedicata) eam mibi celeri maun mittas. Nam operi meo
Boethiano ea translatio multum attulerit, and hoc a te vebemeuter peto. Valo
