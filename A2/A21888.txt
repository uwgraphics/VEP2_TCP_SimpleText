By the Queen.
WHere, for the service of her Majesty, and her Realm, committed to Sir
Walter Raleigh Knight, Captain of her Majesty's Guard, to be done upon the
Seas for defense of the Realm, some number of Mariners have been prested to
serve in that voyage, and some other more are further to be prested, Because
her Majesty would have the said service in no sort to be delayed, and that
the said Sir Walter Raleigh is fully ready with all the Ships to be under
his charge: Her Majesty most straightly commands, that all Mariners and
Soldiers that are already prested, do forthwith repair to their shipping,
upon pain of death, as is due to them that shall offend to the contrary: And
that all others that shall be prested for this service, do repair likewise
without delay to the shipping, upon like pains. And that no person do
entertain or with hold any of them that are already prested, or that shall be
prested, upon pain of imprisonment and further punishment according to the
quality of their offenses.

Given at her Majesty's Palace of Westminster, the second day of March, in the
four and thirtieth year of her Majesty's reign.

God save the Queen.

Imprinted at London by the Deputies of CHRISTOPHER BARKER, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.
