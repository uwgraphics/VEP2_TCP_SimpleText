A Declaration of great troubles pretended against the Realm by a number of
Seminary Priests and Iesuists, sent, and very secretly dispersed in the
same, to work great treasons under a false pretense of religion, with a
provision very necessary for remedy thereof. Published by this her Majesty's
Proclamation.
ALthough we have had probable cause to have thought, that now toward the end
of xxxiij. years, being the time wherein almighty God, has continually
preserved us in a peaceable possession of our kingdoms, the former violence
and rigor of the malice of our enemies (specially of the King of Spain)
would after his continuance in seeking to trouble our estate, without any just
cause so many years, have waxed faint and decayed in him, and all others
depending on him, and been altered into some peaceable humor, meet to have
disposed him to live in concord with us, and other Christian Princes his
neighbors, and by such good means to establish an universal peace in
Christendom now by his wars only, and no otherwise disturbed: yet to the
contrary we find it, by his present mighty actions, so great as he never
before this time attempted the like. Whereby it so pleases the Almighty God
of Hosts, (as we are persuaded) to suffer the ruin or correction of such as
will not be content to live in peace with their own: And to that end, to
permit the said King now in this his declined years meetest for peace, and
when he ought to be satisfied, without seeking of more kingdoms, by violence
and arms (seeing he possesses at this day, more Crowns, Kingdoms and
Countries, and more earthly wealth then any of his progenitors, or any other
Prince Christian ever had) now to beginue a most unjust and a dangerous war
for all Christendom against the present French King. As in like manner appeared
he meant two years past to have done the like against us, by inuading of our
Kingdoms, in the very time of a treaty of peace with us. Whereof God gave him
and his whole army a just cause of repentance.

1 And therefore seeing we do now manifestly understand, that he has of late
(to fortify these his strange violent attempts with some new color)
procured a Milanois a vassaile of his own to be exalted into the Papacy of
Rome, and has seduced him, without consent of the College of Cardinals to
exhaust the treasures of the Church, and therewith to levy forces in Italy
(which had no sound of war in it these many years) and in many other
places, to be guyded by his Nephewe, and sent to invade France, a kingdom that
has been always a maintainer of that Church in all their oppressions. And for
that this war, so generally, and mightily against France, concerns our
estate very greatly, and cannot but be directly very dangerous to our
dominions: And that it is also known to us, that by sundry means, besides the
preparation of other great forces for the Seas, against our Crown and
Dominions, the same be greater for this year to come, then ever he had
before. And for furtherance thereof, has also lately by color of this his
peculiar Popes authority, which he has now hanging at his girdle, practiced
with certain principal seditious heads, being unnatural Subjects of our
Kingdom (but yet very base of birth) to gather together with great labors
upon his charges, a multitude of dissolute young men, who have partly for lack
of living, partly for crimes committed, become Fugitives, Rebels, and
Traitors, and for whom there are in Rome, and Spain, and other places
certain receptacles made to live in, and there to be instructed in School
points of fedition, and from thence to be secretly and by stealth conveyed
into our Dominions, with ample authority from Rome, to move, stir up, and
persuade as many of our Subjects, as they dare deal withal, to renounce
their natural allegiance due to us and our Crown, and upon hope by a Spanish
Invasion to be enriched and endowed with the Possessions and Dignities of our
other good Subjects: For which purpose they do bind our Subjects (with whom
they practice) by Oaths, yea by Sacraments to forswear their natural
allegiance to us, and yield their obedience with all their powers to this
King of Spain and to assiste his forces. And for the more forcible attraction
of these unnatural people (being weak of understanding) to this their bend,
these Seedemen of treason bring certain Bulls from the Pope, some of
Indulgences pretending to promise Heaven to such as will yield: and some of
cursinges, threatening damnation and Hell, to such as shall not yield to their
persuasions. And though these manner of Popish attempts, have been of long time
used, yet in some sort also they have been impeached, by direct execution of
Laws against such Traitors for mere treasons, and not for any points of
Religion, as their fautours would color falsely their actions, which are
most manifestly seen and heard at their arraignements, how they are neither
executed, condemned, nor endited, but for high Treasons, affirming, that
amongst other things, they will take part with any army sent by the Pope
against us and our Realm. And of this that none do suffer death for matter of
Religion, there is manifest proof, in that a number of men of wealth in our
Realm professing contrary Religion, are known not to be impeached for the
same, either in their lives, lands, or goods, or in their liberties, but only
by payment of a pecuniary sum, as a penalty for the time that they do
refuse to come to Church, which is a most manifest course to falsify the
slanderous speeches and Libelles of the Fugitives abroad. Yet now it is
certainly understood, that these heads of these dens and receptacles,
which are by the traitors called Seminaries, and Colleges of Jesuits, have
very lately assured the King of Spain, that though heretofore he had no good
success with his great forces, against our Realm, yet if now he will once
again renew his war this next year, there shall be found ready secretly
within our Dominions, many thousands (as they make their account for their
purpose) of able people that will be ready to assist such power as he shall
set on land, and by their vaunting, they do tempt the King hereto, who
otherwise ought in wisdom, and by his late experience conceive no hope of any
safe landing here: showing to him in Spain, by the special information of a
Schooleman named Parsons, arrogating to himself the name of the King
Catholics Confessor, and to the Pope at Rome, by an other Scholar called
Allen, now for his treasons honored with a Cardinals Hatte, certain skroles
or beadrolles of names, of men dwelling in sundry parts of our Countries, as
they have imagined them, but specially in the maritimes, with assurance, that
these their Seedmen named Seminaries, Priests, and Jesuits are in the sundry
parts of the Realm, secretly harbored, having a great part of them been
sent within these x. or xii. months, and shall be ready to continue their
reconciled people in their lewd constancy to serve their purpose both with
their forces, and with their traiterous enterprises when the Spanish power
shall be ready to land, upon which their impudent assertions to the Pope, and
to the king of Spain (though they know a great part thereof to be false)
they have now very lately advertised into diverse parts by their secret
messengers, whereof some are also very lately taken, and have confessed the
same, that the King upon their informations and requests has promised to
employ all his forces that he can, by sea this next year, to attempt once
again the invasion of this Realm: Wherewith because some of his wisest
Counselors doubt that he shall not prevail, therefore he is otherwise
persuaded, that if that his purpose shall not take place here, yet the same may
be well employed against France or the Low Countries, or against some part
of Scotland, into which Realm there has also some number of the like brood
been lately sent.

2 Wherefore considering that these the intentions of the King of Spain, are
to us in this sort made very manifest, And although we doubt not, but almighty
God, the defender of all just causes, will (as always hitherto he has) make
the same void: Yet it is our duty as being the supreme Governor under his
Almighty hand, to use all such just and reasonable means as are given to us,
and therewith to concur or rather attend upon his most gracious favor by the
help of our faithful Subjects, both to increase our forces to the uttermost
of their powers, and by execution of Laws, and by all other politic
ordinances to impeach the foresaid practices of these seditions and treasons.

3 And before all other things, we do first require of the Ecclesiastical
state, that the like diligence be used by the godly Ministers of the Church,
by their diligent teaching and example of life, to retain our people
steadfastly in the profession of the Gospel, and in their duties to almighty
God and us, as it is seen a few Capital heads of treasons are continually
occupied with their Seminaries, in withdrawing of a multitude of ignorants to
their enchantments.

4 And secondly, for having of sufficient forces in readiness by Sea, we hope
by Gods goodness, and with the help of our good Subjects, to have as great,
or greater strength on the Seas then at any time we have had, to withstand
these puffed vaunts from Spain: And for our forces by land, our trust is, that
seeing we have distributed our whole realm into several charges of
Lieutenancies, that they by themselves where they may be personally present,
and otherwise by their deputies and assistants of other our Ministers, will now
after the general Musters which have been by our special order lately taken,
consider of all things requisite to perform, and make perfect all defects that
shall appear necessary, to make all the bands both of horsemen and footmen
fully furnished with armor, weapons, and munition, and with all other things
requisite for their conduction to the places of service, and there also to
continue as time shall require to defend their Country. And so we do most
earnestly require and charge all manner of our Subjects, with their hands,
purses, and aduises, yea all and every person of every estate, with their
prayers to God, to move him to assist this so natural, honorable, and
profitable a service being only for defense of their natural country, their
wives, families, children, lands, goods, liberties, and their posterities
against ravening strangers, wilful destroyers of their Native country and
monstrous traitors.

5 And lastly, to withstand and provide speedy remedy against other fraudulent
attempts of the Seminaries, Jesuits, and Traitors, without the which (as it
appears) the forces should not be now used, the same being wrought only by
falsehoode, by hypocrisy, and by underminings of our good Subjects under a
false color and face of holiness, to make breaches in men's and women's
consciences, and so to train them to their treasons, and that with such a
secrecy by the harboring of the said traitorous messengers in obscure places,
as without very diligent and continual search to be made, and severe orders
executed, the same will remain and spread it self as a secret infection of
treasons in the bowels of our Realm, most dangerous, yea, most reproachful to
be suffered in any well ordered common weal: Therefore we have determined by
advise of our Counsel, to have speedily certain Commissioners, men of honesty,
fidelity, and good reputation to be appointed in every Shire, City, and Port
towns within our realm, to inquire by all good means what persons are by their
behauiours or otherwise worthy to be suspected to be any such persons, as have
been sent, or that are employed in any such persuading of our people or of any
residing within our realm to treason, or to move any to relinquish their
allegiance to us, or to acknowledge any kind of obedience to the Pope or to the
King of Spain, and also of other persons that have been thereto induced, and
that have thereto yielded. And further to proceed in the execution of such
their Commission as they shall be more particularly directed by instructions
annexed to their said Commission.

6 And furthermore, because it is certainly known and proved by common
experience, upon the apprehension of sundry of the said traitorous persons
sent into the Realm, that they do come into the same by secret Creekes, and
landing places, disguised, both in their names and persons: Some in apparel,
as Soldiers, Mariners, or Merchants, pretending that they have been heretofore
taken prisoners, and put into Galleys, and delivered: Some come in as gentlemen
with contrary names, in comely apparel, as though they had traveled into
foreign Countries for knowledge: And generally all, or the most part, as soon
as they are crept in, are clothed like Gentlemen in apparel, and many as
gallants, yea in all colors, and with feathers, and such like disguising
themselves, and many of them in their behavior as Ruffians, far off to be
thought, or suspected to be Friars, Priests, Jesuits, or Popish Scholars. And
of these many do attempt to resort into the Universities and houses of Law
from whence in former times they departed: many into services of Noble men,
Ladies and Gentlemen, with such like fraudulent devises to cover themselves
from all apprehension, or suspicion: and yet in process of time, they do at
length so insinuate themselves to get themselves credit with hypocrisies, as
they infect both the Masters and Families, and consequently adventure also,
yea secretly to use their offices of Priesthood and reconcilements: Whereby
all such as do retain them are worthy to be suspected, and may be charged
by Law to their great danger.

7 For avoiding whereof, and either to discover these venomous Vipers, or to
chase them away out of the realm from the infecting of many more, We do order
and straightly charge and command all manner of persons of what degree soever
they be without any exception, Spiritual, or Temporal, Nobleman, Gentleman,
Lord, Lady, Master or Mistress, or owner whatsoever of any house, family,
lodging, yea the very Officers of our own household, and Governors of any
societies, to make a present, due, and particular Inquisition of all manner of
persons that have been admitted, or suffered to have usual resort, diet,
lodging, residence in their houses, or in any place by their appointment, at
any time within the space of one whole year now past, and ended at Michaelmas
last: Or that from thencefoorth have, or shall be admitted, or suffered so to
resort, eat, lodge, reside or attend: And by such Inquisition and examination,
to be duly and particularly informed of what condition and Country any such
person is, and by what kind of means he has heretofore lived, and where he
has spent his time for the space of one whole year before. And likewise to
know whether he has used, and does use to repair to the Church at usual
times to divine service, according to the Laws of the realm. And to cause
those Inquisitions, with their answers to be put into writing particularly,
and the same to keep in a manner of a Register or Calendar to be showed when
they shall be demanded, that upon cause of suspicion of any such person, the
same may be further tried by the Commissioners of those places, whether the
same persons so examined be loyal Subjects or no. And if any such shall be
found unwilling to answer to such Inquisition, or shall be found by his
doubtful answer not likely to be an obedient Subject, the same person shall be
stayed by the householder, or him that ought to have examined him, and shall be
sent to any of the Commissioners above mentioned next adjoining. And if any
person having government or commandment over any such servant, or resiant,
shall be found not to have performed the points of the foresaid Inquisition
as is above limited, the same shall be called to appear before the said
Commissioners, or before our privy Counsel, if the quality of the person
shall so require, and shall be further used and ordered for such default, as
the said Commissioners, or our Counsel shall have just cause to deal with such
a person. And finally, we do admonish and straightly charge and command all
persons that have had any intelligence, with any such so sent or come from
beyond the Seas to such purposes, to detect them to the Commissioners in that
behalf to be assigned as aforesaid, within twenty days after the
publication hereof, in the Shire, Town, or City, or Port, within the
precinctes of the same Commission, upon pain that the offenders therein, shall
be punished as abettours and mainteiners of traitors. Wherein we are
resolutely determined to suffer no favor to be used for any respect of any
persons, qualities, or degrees, nor shall allow, or suffer to be allowed any
excuse of negligence for not detection, or for not due examination of the
qualities of such dangerous persons according to the order here before
prescribed, being no wise contrary, but agreeable to the most ancient laws and
good vsages of our Realm, devised for the good order of al manner of subjects
in every precinct of any Leete to be foorthcomming to answer for their
behauior toward the dignity of our Crown, and the common peace of our Realm.

Given at our Manor of Richmond the xviii. day of October, 1591. in this
xxxiii. year of our reign.
God save the Queen.
