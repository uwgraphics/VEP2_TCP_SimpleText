To the Camp of Israel, etc.
MY dearly beloved Friends, Brethren and Sisters, who are of the stook of
Abraham, and Seed of Israel, who are brought, and bringing forth of the Land of
darkness, and house of bondage, by the outstretched Arm of the Almighty
Jehovah, to follow him who is an everlasting Light, into the Heavenly Land of
rest and peace, which endures for ever; who are of Caleb and Joshua's spirit,
wholly resigned to do or suffer the Will of God in all things in your
generation, who are the true Israelites indeed, without guile, partiality or
hypocrisy, the chosen generation, the Royal Priesthood, zealous for God and
good works, and valiant for the Truth upon earth, who can forsake all to follow
the Lamb in his footsteps of patience, long-suffering, love and meekness,
wisdom and fear, bearing all things, enduring all things, hoping always in God,
and rejoicing in tribulations, glorying in nothing saving in the Cross of our
Lord Jesus Christ, resolving in his strength with purpose of heart to cleave
fast unto the Lord, though your outward man perish or be offered up as a living
sacrifice for his holy Name and Truth: I say, that you truly are my brethren
and sisters; I have no greater joy than to sit down with you, and feed with you
at your Table, which indeed is no less then the Table of the Lord which he has
spread for us; yea, even when we were in the Wilderness did he give us Manna
from Heaven, Angels food, and water out of the Rock which then followed us;
blessed for ever be the Lord and the remembrance of his Name. And when I call
to mind these things, and the multitude of his mercies and endless compassions
which he showed toward us in the days of our infancy, when he took us by the
hand, and taught us to go; my bowels are turned within me, and I am melted
before the Lord. O Israel, what has thy God done for thee! Stand still a
little, and consider how he has dealt with thee in the days past; whether he
has dealt so with any Nation; how he has made Rivers in the Desert, and the
dry Land to become springs of Water: How has he filled the hungry with good
things, and sent the rich empty away! He has brought down the mighty from
their seats, and exalted them of low degree: He has made the Wilderness a
fruitful field, and turned the fruitful Land into barrenness, because of the
iniquity of them that dwelt therein. He has divided the sea, and made it stand
on heaps while his chosen Remnant passes over, He has overthrown the horse
and his Rider; he has pierced Leviathan, and bruised the head of the crooked
Serpent, and broken the great teeth and jaws of the wicked; he has delivered
from the mouth of the Lion, and from the paw of the Bear, and from the
uncircumcised Philistines: He has made the Lame to leap as an Heart and the
Tongue of the dumb to sing. He has set the solitary in Families, and is
leading Joseph like a Flock, and making him Ruler over Egypt, the Land of
darkness. O magnify the Name of the Lord all ye children of Israel, and let
the inhabitants of the Ro^k sing for joy, for great and mavelous things has
the Lord done for his people; he has raised the dead, and brought Lazarni from
the grave: He has opened the eyes of the born blind; he has cleansed the
Lepers, and cast out Devils, and they are gone into the Herd of Swine. He has
fed a great multitude with a little portion, and yet much remains. He has
cured the daughter of Abraham which was bowed down many years. He has stopped
the running issue, which all the Physicians of no value could never do. He has
made a Hedge about Job, and delivered just Lot out of Sodom, and brought him to
Zoar.

These things has the Lord of Life done among us, of which we are
eyewitnesses; and his own Arm, has brought salvation, and has wrought all
our Works in us, and for us, which none other man could do. O praise the Lord
for ever, all ye that have breath in the Land of the living, and let the sons
of Jacob have him and his works in everlasting remembrance. If we forget his
mercies showed unto Zion, and his wonders in deep, let our right hand forget
her cunning: If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, and what thy God has done for
thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth: But how is my soul become
as a watered Garden, in brokenness and humility before the Lord God of our
salvation, when I call to mind his tender mercies and dealings of old; and when
I remember the Wormwood and the Gall, and how there was none found worthy in
Heaven nor Earth to open the Book, and to loose the seals, neither to look
thereon, but the Lamb which had been slain; then was the time of weeping and of
great mourning, as in the Valley of Haddadrimmon; yea even apart in the
Wilderness and solitary places. O Lord God, shall thy people ever forget these
things, and thy wonders upon the Land of Egypt, which thou wroughtest for thy
Seeds sake, and the great salvation which thou have showed to Israel? Shall
there ever be an image made, or the likeness of any thing in Heaven or in
Earth, to be bowed down to, but thy Name alone, which is and shall be exalted
above every Name, in which thy babes and children have found comfort, strength
and safety to this day? Or shall any thing sit in thy Judgment Seat with thee,
but that which overcomes, and is thy Son? is not all power in Heaven and
Earth, and all Judgment committed to him in whose mouth is found no guile, who
is meek and lowly in heart, who loosed the seals, and opened the Book, and did
prevail, and has prevailed over the Dragon and his Angels; who makes war in
righteousness, and in it goes on conquering and to conquer: who has the Keys
of Death and of Hell. Therefore let your eyes be alone unto him, O ye followers
of the Lamb, and fear not man, neither look unto man whose breath is in his
nostrils; but be valiant for the Truth upon Earth, which endures for ever.
Follow your Captain, even of your salvation, ye White-Horse-men, who are of the
Armies that are in Heaven, whose clothing is white and clean, and your Armor
the whole Armor of Light, having on the ornament of a meek, quiet and patient
spirit, which is of great price in the sight of God, though in it you appear as
fools in the sight of men: You are of that Troop which shall overcome at the
last, though you seem as to the outward appearance, to be overcome and trampled
under foot for a season, for the exercise and trial of your faith and patience,
through which God is bringing his Lambs nearer to his bosom, though their face
is marred more then any man's, and their form more then the sons of men. But the
Lord of Hosts is with you, and the shout of a King is among you, which shall
make Nations to tremble, and the beasts of the field to fly before him. The
Lion of the Tribe of Judah has roared out of Zion, and has uttered his voice
from his holy Temple New-Jerusalem, and he it is that must get the victory, and
have the dominion and reign, til all his Enemies are become his footstool. This
is the Lords doing, and this Work he will accomplish by his own arm; therefore
lift up your heads ye babes and suckling children of the most High, and be bold
in the strength of the Almighty, and in it be very courageous in this the day
of his power: Feel Caleb and Joshua's spirit stirred up, which says, We will
go on, the Lord will go before us, and he will fight our battles, and we shall
prevail: For the Battle is the Lords, the Work is the Lords, and he will
accomplish it; the day is his, the set-time is come, and the victory is and
must be his: Here you dwell in the pure sense and feeling of the noble Plant of
renown, the right Seed, which will wholly follow the Lord; this his soul takes
pleasure in, and he will never forsake it, though a Woman may forsake her child;
this will never draw back because of persecutions, threatenings or fiery trials,
Furnace or Den of Lions; but puts on the whole Armor of God; and is clad with
zeal as with a Cloak, and sets its face like a Flint, because of truth, and
because of righteousness. This is the Royal birth which God has raised and
will raise, to whom the Kingdom and Dominion belongs forevermore; it is against
this the enmity is; the Devil and the Dragons malice is against this Child,
after its Blood the Whore, Beast, Dragon and false Prophet have thirsted from
Cain unto this day: This is the Lamb that has been slain from the foundation
of the World. This is the holy Child against whom Herod and Pilate, and all the
Rulers took counsel in all ages against the holy Child; not so much against
Profession is their aim, but at the Life and holy Birth it self, which is born
and manifest in flesh, which has been the mystery hidden from ages and
generations, but now is, and shall be manifest more and more through all these
trials and shakings, to the ends of the earth. This is he whose Vesture is dipped
in blood, whom the Armies in Heaven follow; in heaven, not in earth, or of the
earth are his Armies; but in heaven, making War in righteousness and
holiness, patience and long-suffering: This is his heavenly Army that shall
overcome with him, and get the victory over the Beast, the Dragon, the Whore
and the false Prophet; the Lord God that lives for ever has spoken it: The
Lamb must overcom, and the Kingdom, and the greatness of it shall be given to
the Saints of the most high, and they shall possess it even to the end.

Therefore fear not ye little Flock, whose breathing hearts are upright before
God, Angels and men, who have the witness in you, that you seek nothing but
Truth, Righteousness and Peace with God and Man, and have no end but the glory
of God and the exaltation of his Name, by the raising of his Seed, and the
salvation of the souls of the children of men, whose feeding is in the green
pastures, which lie in the low Valleys by the still Waters of Shiloh which run
softly. The Lord is with you, though you are as Worms in your own eyes, and are
ready to say with Mary, How can this be, seeing I know not a man! I have no
might, power, wisdom, strength or ability of my own. Be but the Virgin, wholly
resigned into the Will of God, with thine eye single, fixed in thy head, and the
power of the Most High shall overshadow thee: And the Kingdom of God consists
in power righteousness and joy in the holy Ghost, into which the wise Virgins
enter, who are the followers of the Lamb (in whose mouth is found no guile)
through the great tribulations; these are the true Israelites indeed, not only
in word, but in deed and in truth. These follow him in the regeneration, and
have the white Robes and the Palms given unto them. These sing the new song
which no man could learn but they that are redeemed from the Earth. These sit
in the heavenly places with Christ Jesus, upon twelve Thrones judging the
twelve Tribes of Israel. These are they that are beheaded and suffer for the
Word of God, and the Testimony which they hold: Mark, they hold it, and do not
let it go, but let go the Earth with the glory, treasures, delights and
pleasures of it; but holds the Testimony of Jesus, and have chosen the good
part with Mary, which endures for ever, and lets go the cumbrings with the many
things, for the one only needful thing, the Word of God, which is the Word of
Power, of Life, of Patience, of Reconciliation, and of Wisdom, which saves the
immortal soul, which is but one Word which was in the beginning, with whom
Enoch walked, and was translated, which is God the Judge of all, unto which we
are come, and to the Heavenly Jerusalem, the City of the living God, and to the
spirits of just men made perfect, where is no occasion of stumbling, but God is
the Judge of all, who brings the hidden things to light; but before this is
witnessed, there may be stumbling and occasions of stumbling, and a Judgment
may be given (before the Lord come) in the unjust man's spirit, which is for
Judgment. But take heed of this thing, I charge, and also beseech thee, O
Israel, in the Word of the Lord that lives and abides for ever, as thou
love his holy Name, the peace and prosperity of Jerusalem, and the welfare of
thine own soul: But live in the Word of Wisdom and true Authority and patience
of the Lamb, and dwell with God the Judge of all, in whose righteous Judgment,
and before whose Throne judge thy self, and let the beam be plucked out of
every eye that would presume to judge before the time; and let the dread of the
Lord be before it; for it is a fearful thing to usurp Authority over Christ
Jesus, which is the man that must judge the World in righteousness, and the
people with Truth, who says to his Disciples, Be ye merciful as your heavenly
Father is merciful: And they who are children of their Heavenly Father, are not
apt to judge rashly before the time, out of his counsel, truth, power, wisdom
and fear; but rather wait in patience until the Time comes (even the Lord) who
brings the hidden things to light, having an eye to the glory of God, and the
good part in all people, as well as salute the people: These have no respect of
persons, neither admire men's persons for advantage sake. These are not in
prejudice or evil surmizings against any, knowing God's hand is going over all
these things, who is the Judge of all; for where any prejudice, respect of
persons, with the beam in the eye, lodges in the heart of any man, in that
state that man's Judgment is unjust and unrighteous, who ever he be; (J speak
from God without partiality:) He has not the mercy that God has to the
unjust; and the very Sun in the Firmament will teach that man wisdom.

Therefore my dearly beloved Friends, Brethren and Sisters, with whom I am
bound up in the bundle of Life, to live and to dye in, and for the righteous
Cause and Work of God, which is his Truth that endures for ever; this is my
exhortation unto you all from the least to the greatest, without respect of
persons or things outward: In the bowels of unfeigned love look all at the good
part which is of God in your selves, and dwell in the good part, in the
remembrance of his mercies and loving kindness which he has showed unto you;
and shut your eyes from seeing of evil, and look only at the good part in all;
then will you answer the good part in Jew and Gentile, and the Church of God.
Here you shall be able to dwell with everlasting burnings, and in the Munition
of Rocks. Here ye dwell with God the Judge of all, and the spirits of just men.
Here Is every high imagination and every thought that would exalt self, brought
down through the Judgment of God, into the obedience of Christ. Here Is that
unjust spirit judged which would take the neighbor or brother by the throat,
or lay hands suddenly on any, which Paul charged Timothy not to do.

Therefore all ye dear children of God, keep out of that spirit, and let it not
have place in you, no not for a moment; but dwell in the life and wisdom of God
the Judge of all, where you will feel the just man's spirit, which can judge and
try all things, and be established in it; for I have considered that this is a
day of great trials and temptations on every hand, and of the making manifest
them that are approved in God's sight. It is a day which requires retiredness,
fear, watchfulness and diligence, which will keep out of being easily moved or
provoked: But your hearts will come to be established in power, love, and a
found mind, in which your compassions will flow forth toward your brethren,
and toward all men; and ye will feel mercy arise, and pity toward Enemies:
Dwelling your selves always in the sense and feeling of God's Mercies,
Compassions and Long-suffering toward you. I speak what I know through the
exercise of my faith and patience concerning these things; and I have found,
That the thought of prejudice and evil surmizing against any man or creature
whatsoever, is judged with the Life of the true Seed (which lives in the bosom
of God, the Judge of all, which can stand upon the Sea of Glass mingled with
Fire) to be of the Enmity which came of the old crooked Serpent, the beguiler
and separater from the Tree of Life; Here you will see the Tale-bearers, which
separateth very Friends, of which Wisdom spoke to be very near.

The Lord open your understandings (my dear friends) for my bowels and very
heart is open toward you, with desires and prayers to God for all Israel, That
they might be saved from the Wrath which is to come as a Flood upon the ungodly
and rebellious generation.

And the Lord God of Mercies and Blessings keep us all in meekness and fear,
in his Spirit of Lowliness, Love and Forbearance, in tenderness, forgiving
and forbearing one another, as God for Christ (his Seed's) sake has forgiven
us; shutting that eye that looks after the Moat, for that is the evil eye, the
Hypocrite gone out from, and exalted above the Heir, the Life of God, to which
the Judgment and the Power is committed: This shall never inherit true peace
with God or Man in that state: For evil thoughts lodging, and being joined
unto, defile a man, and shuts that Kingdom against him, into which no unclean
thing can enter.

So my dear Friends, and all you whose faces are turned toward the Paradise of
God, from the Earth, into which ye were driven by transgression: Mind these
things, and let this remembrance be always fresh in you, that you bear not the
Root, but the Root bear you: And this will keep you, that you shall not be
high-minded, but fear; and to be little in your own eyes, as the little Child,
unto whom the Kingdom of God belongs.

And this Spirit (beforementioned) of forgiveness, mercies and long-suffering,
love unfeigned, gentleness and patience, dwelling in the watchfulness for good
(in the Wisdom of God) and not for evil, is the Spirit of the Lamb, whom the
Lord has said, (and fully determined) That it shall prosper and spread through
Nations, and it shall have dominion over them, and they shall bow to it, and it
shall be a blessing unto many people and Nations afar off; and the everlasting
presence and blessings of the Almighty shall accompany it for ever; and the
Gates of Hell shall not prevail against it: But that which is rash, high,
heady, proud, wilful, foolish and stubborn (in which the Leven of the Pharisees
lodges) God will lay low, and abase before him; and all Judgment which is not
his Sons (in whom he is well-pleased, to whom all Judgment is committed and
belongs) he will judge and condemn: And he that judges before he is to me, who
is Lord and Judge of all (and without him) God will judge.

So in the Spirit of the Lamb, dear Babes and Children of Light, go on and
prosper, and be faithful and valiant for the Truth upon the Earth, keeping low
in your own measure, every one marching in his own path; then your Ranks will
not be broken; for thus is it written of the Camp of the Lord which must get
the victory; for the Enemy is very busy, striving every way to draw forth your
simple minds from the strong hold of the Prison of Hope. Therefore blessed is
he that watches and waits always at Wisdoms gate, for there is the simple
preserved in meekness and fear, love and patience, godliness and brotherly
kindness, which is the most excellent way. This is the path where the Lion
cannot come, nor any ravenous Beast can touch this Mountain, but he will be
struck through with the slingstone of David, or a Dart of God's righteous
Judgments: Here Is no destroying nor hurting in all this holy Mountain, but
bearing all things, enduring all things without murmuring, complaining or
envying, dwelling in that love which thinks no evil: This is that Spirit of the
Lamb of God which saves souls, and overcomes or takes away a Multitude of
sins, wherein is no delight to lay open the Brother's nakedness (for that is of
Ham's stock, which God has cursed for ever) but rather a secret crying to the
Lord concerning such things, (O that thy Name might not suffer nor be
reproached through any who profess thy everlasting Name and Truth) and can say
as Moses did, Blot out my Name, rather then thy Name should suffer, or be
justly reproached or dishonored amongst thy people. This is that which is
raised in many, which they love more then Father, Mother, Wife, Children, House
or Lands, yea, or their own Life, as God is witness. Here Is a passage through
the daily Cross, the strait gate into the place of broad Rivers, where goes no
galley with Oars, but a stretching forth and swimming in the Eternal Will and
Obedience of God.

So lift up your Heads, all ye tender Plants of my Heavenly Fathers own
planting, from the virtue which you receive at the Root of David, from which
the branch of Righteousness springs; and dwell in the stilness and patience, in
which ye will feel the bowels of God's Love and Mercies opened in you like a
Fountain, at which ye may drink and be satisfied, and rejoice in God your
Savior, in the midst of all Trials and Tribulations, wherein ye will have
strength and boldness to confess his Name before men, even to the death, in the
day when many shall hide themselves for fear, and for looking at the things
which are swiftly coming upon the Earth. So dear Babes of God, and Children of
the Stock of Israel, put on the whole Armor of Light, and make War in
Righteousness, in the Spirit of the Lamb, in whose mouth guile is not found;
this is the Captain of our Salvation, who has left us an example, that we
should follow his steps, whom looking to, and obeying, the Lord God that made
Heaven and Earth will be with you, and preserve you all his dear children in and
through all your trials and tribulations, which may be suffered to come upon
you for the trial of your faith and patience; and for the purifying and
cleansing his sanctuary: And this Man will be your hiding place from the storm
and from the rain, even the same which was found, the Rock, in a weary Land:
And this is he that vvil stand the last upon the Earth, and get the Victory and
Dominion over and through all, of whose Dominion and Kingdom shall be no end.

So in this the Lord God of Life, of Heaven and Earth, keep you all by his
Eternal power, and establish you on the unmovable Rock of salvation, that so
with one heart, mind and soul, we may glorify the holy Name of our God in this
our Day and Generation, and right walking before him, that so we may give up
our account with joy, and not with grief, and have the Witness in us and for
us, that we are vvel-pleasing in his sight; in which whether we live or dye,
we shall have peace, and joy unspeakable and full of glory.

The Lord God of Life, Love and Peace; Wisdom and Righteousness, be with you
all my dear Brethren and Friends, and preserve you all in his Eternal power
unto his Heavenly Kingdom, there to remain, and in it to rest, when this World
shall be no more.

This is given forth in the movings of the Bowels of God's Love, unto his
people Israel, and in the remembrance of his mercies of old, and of his daily
compassions toward them, which is as an entreaty thereby, that we may all
remember and love his mercies, walking humbly before him all the days of your
life. And to be read in your Meetings as in wisdom and convenience of time ye
have meet opportunity.

By a Companion of them that follow the Lamb through the great tribulations,
for whose sake he can say he loves not his life to the death, enjoying that
Love which is stronger then death: Blessed be the Name of the Lord forever,
Amen.

THE END.
