By the King.
FOrasmuch as his Majesty understands, that there be diverse ancient and
other good and necessary Laws and statutes of this his Kingdom of England,
which do inflict and impose diverse grievous Corporal and pecuniary pains and
punishments, extending in some cases to sentence of death (the last and
greatest punishment,) and in some cases to final exile and banishment out of
their natural Country for ever, upon such as unlawfully hunt or enter into
any Forest, Park, Chase, or Warren, to kill or destroy any Dear or Game with
any Dogs, Nets, Gunnes, Crossebowes, Stonebowes or other Instruments, Engines,
or means whatsoever, or by any such unlawful means or devises to spoil or
destroy the Game of Pheasants, Partridges, Hearne, Mallard, and such like, And
also diverse other good Laws and Statutes, provided for the preventing of the
said offenses, and therefore do prohibit upon great pains and penalties
as well the having or keeping, as the using of any Dear hayes, Buckstalles,
Dogs, Gunnes, Crossebowes, Nets and other Engines, as by the same Laws and
Statutes appears: And yet his Maiestic understands withal, that the same
good Laws and Statutes have had (especially of late time) little or no effect,
in respect there has not been any due execution (the life of all Laws) of the
same, by such to whom the care and charge thereof apperteined: by means
whereof, such boldness and disobedience has grown, specially in the vulgar
sort, as that of late peers, the several Games above mentioned, have been
more excessiuely and outragiously spoilet and destroyed, then has been
attempted and practiced in former ages. His Majesty intending a due and speedy
reformation of the said abuses and offenses, And that the said good Laws and
Statutes be hereafter put in due execution. And yet of his Princely Clemency
and Benignity, now in the beginning of his most happy and prosperous Reign
toward all his loving Subjects, is graciously pleased, and does by these
presents vouchsafe to publish to all his Subjects his intention and
determination therein, to the end that none of them, (which his Majesty
desires) might hereafter incur the severity and punishment of the said
Laws and Statutes: but like good and natural Subjects for their own safety
and good, obey and observe the same. And therefore does straightly charge and
command all and every person and persons, of what estate and degree soever, not
to Hunt, Kill, Take, or destroy, by any of the ways or means abouesayd, or by
any other unlawful mean, device, or invention whatsoever, any of the Games
abouesaid, contrary to any of the aforesaid Laws or Statutes: Nor that they
have, keep, or use any of the said Dear hayes, Buckestalles, Dogs, Gunnes,
Crossebowes, Nets, and other things above mentioned, or any of them, contrary
to any of the said Laws or Statutes. And that if any person or persons, shall,
after this Proclamation made and published, oftend in any of the premises,
against any of the said Laws and Statutes, that then he shall not only
undergo and suffer the severe sentence and punishment of the same, as well for
such offenses hereafter to be attempted or done, as for the like offenses
formerly committed, but also such pains and penalties as may be inflicted upon
such as wilfully contemn and disobey his Commandment Royal. And his Majesty
does further charge and command al Justices, Officers and Ministers
whatsoever, to whom in these cases it does appertain, that they from
henceforth diligently and carefully look to the due executing, as well of the
said Laws and Statutes and every of them, as of his Majesty's pleasure and
Royal Commandment, signified and declared by these presents, And that without
respect of any person or persons of what estate or degree soever, as they will
answer the contrary at their uttermost peril.

Given at our Manor of Greenwich the 16. day of May in the first year of our
Reign of England, France and Ireland, and in the six and thirtieth of
Scotland.
