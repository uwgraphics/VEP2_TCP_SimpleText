A Proclamation concerning Tobacco.
WHereas in the Reign of Our most dear and Royal Father, King JAMES of
blessed memory, and since Our access to the Crown, several Proclamations
have been made and published concerning Tobacco, Yet notwithstanding all the
care and providence which has hitherto been used, We find the unlimited
desire of gain, and the inordinate appetite of taking Tobacco, has so far
prevailed, that Tobacco has been continued to be planted in great quantities,
in several parts of this Our Realm, and a vast proportion of unserviceable
Tobacco made and brought from Our Colonies of Virginia Summer Islands, and other
Our Foreign Plantations, besides an incredible quantity of Brasill and
Spanish Tobacco imported hither, and secretly conveyed on Land. And it is now
come to pass, That those Our Foreign Plantations, that might become useful
to this Kingdom, lingering only upon Tobacco, are in apparent danger to be
utterly ruined, unless We speedily provide for their subsistence; The bodies
and manners of Our people are also in danger to be corrupted, and the wealth
of this Kingdom exhausted by so vselesse a Weed as Tobacco is; which being
represented unto Us by the humble Petition of Our loving Subjects the Planters
and Adventurers in Virginia, and also by the like humble Petition of the
Retailers and Sellers of Tobacco in and about Our Cities of London and
Westminster, We have thought it worthy of Our Princely care, as a matter not
only fit for Our profit, and the profit of Our people, but much concerning Us
in Our honor and government so to regulate the same, and compel due obedience
thereto, that Our Foreign Plantations and Colonies may be supported and
encouraged, and they made useful to this Kingdom, by applying themselves to
more solid commodities, that the healths of Our Subjects may be preserved, the
wealth of this Kingdom enlarged, and the manners of Our people so ordered and
governed, that the world may not justly tax Us, that these are at once
endangered only by the licentious use of Tobacco. And therefore having seriously
advised hereof, We, by the advice of Our Privy Council, have now resolved
upon, and published these Our Commands following concerning Tobacco, which Our
Royal will and pleasure is, shall be in all things observed upon pain of Our
highest displeasure, and of such pains, penalties and punishments, as by Our
Court of Exchequer, and Court of Star Chamber, and by any other Courts and
ministers of Justice, or by Our Prerogative Royal can be inflicted upon the
offenders.

And first, Our will and Command is, that no person whatsoever do at any time
hereafter plant, preserve, or maintain any Tobacco, which is, has been, or
shall be planted in Our Kingdoms of England or Ireland, or Dominion of Wales,
or in the Islands of Iersey or Guernesey, but that the same be utterly
displanted and destroyed, and that none presume or adventure to Buy, Sell, or
utter any such Tobacco, the same being utterly unwholesome to be taken.

And further, that no Tobacco whatsoever be from henceforth imported into
these Our realms, or any Haven, Port, Creek or place thereof, which is, or shall
be of the growth of any the parts or places beyond the Seas, belonging to, or
under the obedience of any foreine King, Prince, or State whatsoever; But such,
and so much thereof only, as We shall specially allow to be imported, until
it shall be fully settled between those Foreign Princes and Us, according to
those Treaties which are between Us, that Our Subjects may not unthriftily
vent the solid Commodities of Our own Kingdoms, and return the proceed
thereof in Smoke.

And further We will and command, that no Tobacco of the growth of any of Our
English Plantations in Virginia the Summer Islands, Caribee Islands, or other
Islands or places in America, or the Coasts thereof, be at any time hereafter
imported or brought into Our Kingdoms of England or Ireland, or Dominion of
Wales, at any other Port then at, or in Our Port of London only, and the same
duly entered in Our Custome-houses there, nor that any greater quantity
thereof be imported there, then We by the advice of Our Privy Council shall
hold fit, and under Our Privy Seal, shall declare to be competent for the
expense of these Our Kingdoms, We not thinking it fit to admit of an
immeasurable expense of so vain and needless a Commodity, which ought to be
used as a Drugge only, and not so vainly and wantonly as an evil habit of
late times has brought it unto.

And these sorts of Tobacco which shall be thus brought from Our own Colonies,
We will take present order shall be well ordered and made up, and so
certified to be, under the hand of the Governor of that place, and when the
same shall be brought hither, shall be again Searched, Tried and Sealed, that
Our Subjects be not abused by corrupt Tobacco.

And Our express Command is, that whatsoever Tobacco shall be taken, which
shall be imported contrary to this Our Proclamation, the same shall be
forfeited and confiscate, and by the Officers of that Port or place where it
shall be taken, shall be immediately burnt.

And for the ordering and governing of the expense and use of Tobacco when it
shall be imported, We, by the advice of Our Privy Council, shall speedily
direct such a course as We shall hold fit, which We expect shall be also in
all things observed.

And We straightly charge and Command all Our Customers, Comptrollers,
Searchers, and all other the Officers and Ministers of Our Ports, that they and
every of them in their several places, do carefully and faithfully observe
Our Royal Command, in, and concerning the premises; and if any of them shall
be found remiss or negligent therein, or to conniue at any such offender, that
he or they shall for such their fault, without any remission be removed from
the place or places of his or their attendance on Our service.

And to the end Our pleasure and Command hereby published, may be the better
executed, We do hereby will, require and Command, all Majors, Sheriffs,
Justices of peace, Bayliffes, Headboroughs, and other Our Officers and loving
Subjects whatsoever, to be aiding and assisting, and so much as in them lies,
to take care that the premises herein mentioned, be duly put in execution, as
they tender their duty and allegiance to Us, and will answer the contrary at
their uttermost perils.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall the sixth day of January, in the sixth year of
Our Reign. God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: and by the Assigns of John Bill. 1630.
