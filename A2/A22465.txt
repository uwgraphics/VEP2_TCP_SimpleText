A Proclamation against the unnecessary waste of Gunpowder.
THE Kings most Excellent MAJESTY, observing the excessive waste, and
consumption of His Majesty's Powder, under pretext of Salutations, and other
needless Ceremonies, grown into custom, and used in His Majesty's Castles,
Block-houses, and Forts, and also in his Ships and Fleetes, which at all
times are needless and superfluous, but in these times of Action are no way
fit to be continued, when there is so much use of Powder to be employed for
Services of necessity: For reformation of which abuse, and preventing the like
for the future, His Majesty by the Advice of His Privy Council, does hereby
straightly charge and command, that from henceforth all Commanders, Captains,
and Officers, of or in any Castles, Blocke-houses, or Forts, do carefully
observe, that they suffer no expense or waste of Powder, to be made in that
kind, or any Shot at all to be made, in, or from such Castle, Blocke-house,
or Fort, otherwise then in Fight with His Majesty's enemies, or as a warning
Piece upon discovery of any enemies, or for staying of any Ships or Vessels
by sufficient Warrant, or for the defense of any the Ships or Vessels of His
Majesty, His Subjects, Friends of Allies, coming within the protection of any
His Majesty's said Castles, Blocke-houses, or Forts: His Majesty does also
straightly charge and command all Admirals, Viceadmirals, Rereadmirals, Captains
and Officers, of, or in any of His Majesty's Fleetes and Ships, that they
neither make, nor suffer to be made, any Shot from any His Majesty's Ships, or
from any Ship or Vessel in His Majesty's service, otherwise then for warning,
or in Fight, or for intercepting or arrest of any Foreign Ships, or upon
assault of any His Majesty's enemies, or in case of distress, or in the
defense or protection of any His Majesty's Ships, or His Subjects, Friends, or
Allies, without special authority, or instructions in that behalf given, or
derived from His Majesty, or from the Lord high Admiral of England, upon
pain, that whosoever shall presume to disobey, or neglect this His Majesty's
Royal Commandment, shall be put from their several and respective Commands,
Offices, and places in which they serve, and upon such further punishments, as
by the Laws of this Realm, or by His Majesty's Prerogative Royal may be
inflicted upon the offenders.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the tenth day of February, in the third year
of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
