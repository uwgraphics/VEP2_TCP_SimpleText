A Proclamation for the better settling of his Majesty's Manufacture of Gold and
Silver thread within this his Realm.
WHereas the Art or Mystery of making Gold and Silver thread ( a commodity of
continual use in this Our Kingdom of England) has formerly been used, and
made by Strangers in foreign parts only, and from thence transported into this
Our Realm; but of late has been practiced by some of Our loving Subjects,
who by their great charge and industry, have so well profited therein, and
attained to such perfection in that Art, that they equal the Strangers, in
the skillful making thereof, and are able by the labors of our own people to
make such store, as shall be sufficient to furnish the expense of this whole
Kingdom. And whereas We, esteeming it a principal part of Our Office, as a
King and Sovereign Prince, to cherish and encourage the Knowledge and
Invention of good and profitable Arts and Mysteries, and to make them frequent
amongst Our own people, especially such, wherein Our people may employ their
labors comfortably, and profitably, and many thereby may be kept from
idleness, hereby to preserve and increase the Honor and wealth of Our State
and people. And finding that the exercising of this Art or Mystery
(considering the continual use of Bullion to be spent in the Manufacture
thereof) is a matter of great importance, and therefore fitter for Our own
immediate care, then to be trusted into the hands of any private persons, for
that the Consumption, or preservation of Bullion whereof Our Coins (the sinews
and strength of Our State) are made, is a matter of so high onsequence, as it
is only proper for Our self to take care and account of; We have heretofore
to the good liking of the Inuentors thereof, taken the said Manufacture of Gold
and Silver thread into Our own hands, and so purpose to retain, and continue
it, to be exercised only by Agents for Our selves, who shall from time to time
be accomptable to Us for the same. And whereas for the better perfecting of so
Royal a Work, by Our Proclamation, Dated the two and twentieth day of March,
in the fifteenth year of Our Reign of England, We did utterly prohibit the
Importation of all foreign Gold and silver thread made in any the parts beyond
the Seas, and the use of any other Gold or Silver thread, then such as should
from time to time be Sealed with a Seal to be to that purpose appointed,
thereby to discover all false, counterfeit and prohibited Stuff, whereby either
Our loving Subjects might be abused, or Our selves deluded, as by the same
Proclamation appears; which We will and Command, and Our express pleasure
is, shall in all things be firmly observed and kept, according to the purport
and true meaning thereof, and of Our Royal intent and pleasure therein
expressed.

Now forasmuch as We find, that notwithstanding Our Proclamation, many have
adventured secretly and by stealth to import Gold and Silver thread from
foreign parts, and many others to make the same within this Realm (not being
thereunto allowed by Us, or Our Agents) and to utter the same to diverse of Our
loving Subjects, not being Sealed with the Seal to that purpose appointed,
whereby We find that Our own Agents and workmen employed about the said
Manufacture are discouraged, and much false and counterfeit Stuff is vented,
to the great deceit of Our Subjects, scandal of the work, and Our own proper
loss, and yet the Offenders therein cannot easily be discovered, whereby they
might be punished according to their demerits: for that the Silkemen and Silk
weauers, and others, who buy and use the said Gould and Silver thread, are
unwilling to discover such Offenders, and (as We have cause to fear) do
rather encourage them in their offense, in contempt of Us and Our proceedings.
To the end therefore, that this Our work which We have appropriated to Our
self, may prosper in Our hands, and neither Our Agents be discouraged, nor the
work discountenanced by the making, working, or uttering any false,
counterfeit, or prohibited Stuff, and that those whom We have trusted and
employed therein, may also perform their duties justly and faithfully, without
just grieuance, or offense to any of Our loving Subjects; We do hereby
straightly charge and Command, That all Silkemen, Silkeweauers, and all and
every person and persons, who now use, or hereafter shall use the Art,
Mystery, Trade, or Occupation of making, working, selling, or uttering of any
Lace, Buttons, or any other thing or things whatsoever, in all, or in part
wrought of or with Gold or Silver thread, or of or with Copper Gold, or Silver
thread, shall from time to time take and keep a true, just, and exact account
in writing, of all the names, professions, and habitations, of all and every
person and persons, of whom they or any of them shall from time to time buy or
receive any Gold or Silver Thread, or Copper Gold or Silver Thread, or any
thing wrought or made in all or in part therewith, with the time and times and
several quantities when and what they so bought or received the same: Which
said Account, they and every of them shall once a month deliver unto a
Register to be to that purpose appointed by some of Our Commissioners for the
said Manufacture, that so the offenders against Our former, and this present
Proclamation, may be the better discovered, and their offenses severely
punished, as being a high Contempt against Us and Our Prerogative Royal: For
the due performance whereof, and to prevent the Inconveniences that may ensue,
Our will and pleasure is, and We do hereby straightly charge and command, That
all and every the persons aforesaid, shall enter into Bond of one hundred or
two hundred pounds a piece and not above (as shall be thought fit by Our
Commissioners appointed for the said Manufacture now, or that hereafter shall be,
or any two of them) to Our Attorney General for the time being, in trust for
Us, with condition to perform all and every the particulars in the former
Clause expressed and commanded, upon the pains hereafter limited, which We
will shall be severely inflicted on them.

And further We will and Command that no Fynor or Fynors of Gold or Silver,
shall at any time or times hereafter melt, disgrosse, or sell, or cause to be
molten, disgrossed or sold any refined Gold or Silver, to any person or persons
whatsoever (other then to Our Agent and undertakers for our said manufacture)
until he or they shall have first entered into Bond to us of one hundred
pounds, or more before our said Commissioners, or any two of them to our use,
to melt none of Our Coins for the making of refined Gold or Silver, and from
time to time, to give a true account in writing of all the Names, Professions,
and habitations of every such person and persons, as shall from time to time,
buy or have any refined Gold or Silver of him or them, and of the true quantity
and quantities of all and every such parcel and parcells, as he or they shall
from time to time utter, sell, or deliver: For all which said Bonds so to be
entered into respectively, We are nevertheless pleased, That no fee or
allowance shall be required or taken, nor that the same Bond shall be sent or
delivered into Our Exchequer, nor otherwise put in Suit, but upon apparent
breach thereof, first appearing to Our Commissioners aforesaid, or any two of
them, or to Our Attorney general for the time being; and that at the end of
every six months the same Bond respectively shall be delivered up to the party
bound, to be Cancelled, if in the mean time no breach thereof shall appear to
have bin made as aforesaid, and then a new Bond to be entered into by him or her
respectively to the same effect, to continue likewise for other six Months,
and so for every six Months, as long as this or Our former Proclamation shall
remain in force, or that Our pleasure shall be further signified to the
contrary. Likewise Our pleasure is that if any of Our said loving Subjects
shall casually or unawares, without any wilful or obstinate Contempt, fall
into the breach of any such bond; that Our Chauncellor of England, or Keeper of
Our Great Seal, for the time being, shall upon a Petition to him exhibited, and
in a summary Course, have power to order and Moderate the same, as he in his
wisdom shall think fit. And also We will and Command, That no Gold-Drawer
or other person or persons, whatsoever, shall at any time hereafter, during this
or Our said former Proclamation, draw, flat, or use any refined Gold or Silver,
for the making of Cloth of Gold, or Cloth of Silver, without the special
License of two of Our said Commissioners, under their hands in writing, first
had and obtained; upon pain of forfeiture of all such Gold or Silver as shall be
wrought, contrary to this Our Royal will and Commandment; and upon pain of
Our high indignation and displeasure, and such other pains and punishments as
in like Cases are usual.

And Our further will and pleasure is, and hereby We do give full power and
authority unto Our said Commissioners, or any two or more of them, and to all
and every such person and persons, as Our said Commissioners or any two or more
of them, shall by warrant or writing under their hands nominate or appoint,
from time to time and at all times convenient, at their pleasure, in peaceable
manner (taking with them a Constable or other fit officer, and giving notice to
the owner or possessor, or his or their servant or servants, or their purpose
in that behalf, to the end they may if they will accompany them) to enter into
all, and all manner of Shoppes, Cellers, worke-houses, warehouses, Storehouses
or other Rooms or places whatsoever, by them suspected, within Our said Realm
of England or the Dominions thereof, as well in Cities, Tsownes corporate, and
places privileged, as elsewhere: And likewise to enter into any ship, bote, or
other vessel whatsoever, riding at Ancre, or otherwise abiding in any Port,
Haven or Creek of Our said Realm, and Dominions thereof, for the searching
and finding out of all such offenses, of what nature soever, as shall be
Committed contrary unto this, or Our said former Proclamation: And likewise to
seize and take into their hands unto Our use, all such Gold and silver thread,
and Copper Gold and Silver thread, and Gold and Silver wire imported, or that
shall be imported into this Our Realm wrought or made, or that shall be
wrought, made, drawn, or flatted within this Realm, other then by Our Agent
and Undertakers, their Deputies and Assigns, touching the said Manufacture.
And further Our pleasure is, that whatsoever thread wrought, or unwrought, as
aforesaid, or wire, shall be so seized to Our use as aforesaid, shall
forthwith, upon the seizure thereof be inuentoried in writing, subscribed by
all such persons, as shall be present at any such seizure, and shall with all
convenient speed, be brought unto Our said Commissioners, now, and for the time
being, or any two of them, to be disposed of, as we shall think fit, and
direct from time to time. And for the better accomplishment of Our service
herein, We do hereby straightly charge and Command all Majors, Sheriffs,
Justices of the Peace, Constables, Comptrollers, Searchers, Waiters, and all
and every other Our Officers, or Ministers and Subjects whatsoever, That they
and every of them be from time to time assisting, aiding and helping unto Our
said Commissioners, and such as they, or any two of them shall authorize in
that behalf, in and by all things in the due Execution and performance of the
premises, according to Our true meaning herein declared, as they tender Our
pleasure, and will answer the contrary at their utmost perils. And further,
We will and declare Our Royal pleasure and Commandment to be, that if any
person or persons shall withstand, or refuse to obey this Our Proclamation, in
all or any part thereof, upon complaint and proof thereof had and made in that
behalf, before Our Commissioners or any two, or more of them, that now be, or
hereafter shall be for the said Manufacture, or before Our Attorney General
for the time being, that they take order to punish any such person so
offending, as a contemner of Our Royal will and Commandment, by imprisonment
or otherwise, as shall and may stand with the Justice of this Our Realm. And
We further hereby declare Our intent and pleasure to be, That if any Agent,
workman, or other person or persons whatsoever, employed by Us, or Our said
Commissioners, now or at any time hereafter, in, or about the said Manufacture,
or any thing thereunto belonging, or in, or about any search to be made as
aforesaid, shall in any thing falsify the trust by Us, or Our said
Commissioners committed to him, or them, to the just offense, or grieuance of
any of Our loving Subjects, that Our ears shall be ever open to any just
complaint to be made thereof: And that every person who shall wilfully or
corruptly offend by color of any authority, or employment given, or derived
from Us, any way touching or concerning the said Work, shall be severely
punished for the same, according to the quality of his or their offense.

Given at Roystone the tenth day of October, in the seventeenth year of Our
Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the three and fiftieth.
