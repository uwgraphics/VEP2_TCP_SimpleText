By the King.
A Proclamation for reforming the abuses in making of Gold and Silver Thread
within this Realm, and for the inhibiting the Importation thereof, from the
parts beyond the Seas.
JAMES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
defender of the faith, etc. To all to whom these presents shall come, Greeting.
Where We have always held it one of the most necessary cares and
considerations, incident to the State and office of Kings and Sovereign
Princes, so to dispose of their people and government, as the knowledge and
use of good and profitable Arts and Inventions, may become common and frequent
among their people, the same being one of the greatest means to increase and
preserve the wealth and strength of State and people; considering that labor
and industry well employed, makes kingdoms great and flourishing. And
forasmuch as some of Our good and loving Subjects of Our Realm of England have
of late, to their great charge, brought into this Our Kingdom, and have herein
by their great industry erected and perfectly established the Art and Mystery
of making Gold and Silver thread, a Feate or Manifacture, formerly used or made
in foreign parts beyond the Seas, and by Strangers and others from thence
transported and brought, as a commodity of great use, into this Our Kingdom
of England, wherein they have so well and commendably proceeded, as that they
are now able to make sufficient store of Gold and Silver thread, to serve for
the use and expense of Our whole Kingdom. And whereas, a matter of so great
consequence, and wherein so many of Our people should be interessed, both in
the making and use thereof, may well be judged more fit for Us to take into Our
hands, then to leave the same to the power and dispose of private men; and
as well to prevent the abuses which may be offered to Us and Our Subjects, by
the counterfeiting of the said Gold and Silver thread, as likewise for the
preservation of Bullion within this Our Kingdom, We have caused this Our
whole work to be taken into Our possession, for the general good and benefit
of Our people and loving Subjects, and have also provided and taken sufficient
order that Our loving Subjects in all parts, shall not at any time want
convenient quantity of the said Gold and Silver thread for their use, but shall
also be served of it at reasonable prises: And that such as are skillful in the
working and spinning thereof, shall be employed therein, if they faithfully and
honestly perform the same, and at such rates and wages, as they whom We
specially shall license thereunto shall think meet and convenient: which care
and good intention of Us, has of late been greatly interrupted and opposed,
not only by the bringing into Our said Kingdoms and Dominious great
quantities of Gold and Silver thread, from diverse parts beyond the Seas, but
also by the private working and making thereof in Corners, by diverse strangers
and others, contrary to Our Patent of privilege heretofore granted; the same
being no known nor continued trade within these our Realms; howsoever diverse
of the Goldsmiths of London have lately presumed and attempted to make the same
parcel of their Trade, by reason only of some few experiments heretofore by
them and others made, and by fittes only, and for very small quantities of
Gold and Silver thread, whereby this so excellent an Invention thus brought
into this Our Kingdom, is likely to be utterly overthrown, and Our Subjects
much wronged by counterfeit and base Gold and Silver thread, made and sold by
the underhand workers, if the same by Our care should not be provided for, and
speedily prevented: And albeit that by means of the Gold and Silver thread,
made and to be made within Our said Realms, We should receive great
hinderance in Our Customs and other duties, formerly paid unto Us and Our
Predecessors, Kings and Queens of this Realm of England, for and upon that
commodity imported, for which nevertheless We have taken order as far as is
convenient: Yet We that in all Our Actions and proceedings have Our eye of
grace rather upon the flourishing estate of Our Kingdoms, and the comfort of
Our people, then upon Our profit, have resolved to prefer the estate and good
of Our Kingdom, before the precise consideration of Our own benefit, rather
then to interrupt or overthrow so excellent a work, and effect of our care and
princely policy for the welfafe of Our subjects. These are therefore to
require and command all and singular person and persons whatsoever, as well Our
natural borne subjects as Denizens, or strangers, that none of them, nor any
other person or persons whatsoever, (other then such as We shall give special
license thereunto; and such as they shall set on work) do at any time or
times hereafter attempt or presume to make any Gold or Silver thread, or Copper
Gold and Silver thread within Our said Realms and Dominions, upon pain of
forfeiture of all and every quantity and quantities, parcel or parcels of
such Gold and Silver thread, and Copper Gold and Silver thread, so made in Our
said Realms and Dominions contrary to this Our present commandment, and also
upon pain of Our high indignation and displeasure, and such further pains,
penalties, and punishments, as for the contempt of Our commandment Royal in
this behalf, may any way be inflicted upon them or any of them so offending,
contrary to the true intent and meaning herein signified.

And whereas by a Statute made in the fourth year of the late King Henry the
seventh, it was ordained and enacted, that no Finer of Gold and Silver, nor
parter of the same by fire or water, from thenceforth should alay no fine
Silver nor Gold, nor none sell in any otherwise, nor to any person or persons,
but only to officers of Mints, changes, and Goldsmithes within this Realm, for
the augmentation and amendment of Coin and Plate; nor sell to no person any
manner of Silver, molten and alaied, upon pain of forfeiture of the same, or the
value of the Gold or Silver so alayed or sold. And that no Goldsmith within
this Realm should melt or alay any fine Silver, to, or for any works of other
intent, but only for making of amels, or for amending of Plate, nor that they
should sell no fine Silver, nor other Silver alayed, molten into mass to any
person or persons whatsoever they be, nor one Goldsmith to another, upon pain
of forfeiture of the same Silver, or value thereof. We therefore for the
better execution of Our said will and pleasure, and preservation of Our Bullion
within this Our Kingdom, do further straightly charge and command, that no
Goldsmith or Goldsmithes, Finer or Finers, Parter or Parters of Gold and Silver
within Our said Dominions, shall for their use or benefit, uses or benefittes,
fine, part, or cause to be fined or parted any Gold or Silver, or provide or
cause to be provided any Gold or Silver, and the same utter and sell or
otherwise dispose to any person or persons whatsoever, whereby to make or cause
to be made the said Gold and Silver thread, except to such person and persons,
as We shall license to make the same to Our use; And that the said Goldsmith or
Goldsmithes, Finer or Finers, Parter or Parters or any of them, or any for them
or to their use or uses, shall not provide, utter, sell, or deliver any Gold or
Silver at all to any person or persons whatsoever, without taking special
notice of the names and habitations of such person and persons, as shall buy,
receive, or have any such Gold or Silver of them, to the end it may appear to
Us, to what use and uses the same Gold and Silver shall be employed, upon
pain of forfeiture of all such Gold and Silver, and of undergoing Our high
indignation and displeasure, with such further pains and punishments, as for
the same their defaults, may any ways be inflicted upon them and every of
them, in this behalf offending.

And We do further straightly charge and Command all and singular person and
persons whatsoever, within Our said Realms and Dominions, that they nor any of
them do, or shall at any time or times hereafter make, erect, set up, mend, or
use any Frame, Engine, Instrument, Mill or Tool whatsoever, for the Drawing,
flatting, milling and spinning of Gold and Silver thread, or of Copper Gold and
Silver thread, or for the Drawing or Flatting, of wire to the end to make the
same, without the license of Us, or such as We in that behalf shall specially
appoint, upon the pains and penalties before expressed: nor that any person or
persons whatsoever shall prouid or sell, or cause to be provided, or sold any
Silk to be thrown or made fitting for the making or spinning of Gold or
Silver Thread, or of Copper Gold and Silver Thread, except to such person and
persons as We shall license to make the same to Our use, upon the like pains and
penalties before mentioned. And that no person or persons whatsoever after the
twentieth day of April next coming, shall attempt or presume to bring in, or
cause to be brought into Our said Realms, and Dominions thereof, or to any of
the Ports, Havens, Creeks, or places of any of them, any Gold or Silver Thread,
or any Copper Gold and Silver Thread, made or to be made in any Foreign place
or places whatsoever, upon pain of Forfeiture of all such Gold and Silver
Thread, and of all such Copper Gold and Silver Thread, so brought in, or caused
to be brought into any of our said Dominions, contrary to Our said
commandment. All which said Gold and Silver Thread, and Copper Gold and Silver
Thread, brought in and forfeited as aforesaid, Our will and pleasure is that
such person or persons as shall make seizure of the same, shall forthwith bring
and convey the same to the Storehouse, within Our Custom House, in Our City of
London. And after such person and persons shall have made such Seizure, of such
forfeited Gold and Silver Thread, and Copper Gold and Silver Thread, and
brought the same to our Custom House as aforesaid, then Our will and pleasure
is that he or they after due appraisement thereof, by the sworn praisers for
such purposes, shall receive the moitie of the value of such Gold and Silver
Thread, and Copper Gold and Silver Thread, so seized and brought in, as
aforesaid, upon pain of imprisonment, and such other punishment as shall be
fit to be inflicted for the breach of this Our Royal Commandment. And Our
further will and pleasure is that no person or persons whatsoever, after the
twentieth day of April next coming, shall buy, receive, utter or sell any
Gold or Silver Thread, or Copper Gold or Silver Thread, made in the parts
beyond the Seas, or made or to be made within any of Our said Dominions, but
only such Gold and Silver Thread, and Copper Gold and Silver Thread, as shall be
first Sealed with Our Seal, already appointed for that use, by such person or
persons as shall be by Us in that behalf, especially nominated or appointed. And
We do hereby further charge and command all Customers and Collectors of Our
Customs, Comptrolers, Farmers and their Deputies, that after the twentieth day
of April next, they take no entry, nor receive any Custom or Subsidy of any
Gold and Silver Thread, or for Copper Gold or Silver Thread, to be imported
from the parts beyond the Seas into this Our Realm of England, or the
Dominions thereof: And for the better Execution of this Our present Will and
Commandment, We do straightly charge and command all Justices of peace,
Majors, Bayliffes, Sheriffs, Constables, Headborowes, Tithingmen, and all
other Our Officers, Ministers and loving Subjects, to whom it shall or may
appertain, from time to time, to be aiding and assisting to all such person
and persons as We shall lawfully, from time to time authorize, for the
searching, seazing, taking, or carrying away of all such Gold or Silver Thread,
and Copper Gold and Silver Thread, imported, wrought, or made, within this Our
Realm and Dominions, contrary to Our pleasure herein expressed.

Given at White Hall the two and twentieth day of March, in the fifteenth year
of Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the one and
fiftieth.s God save the King.
