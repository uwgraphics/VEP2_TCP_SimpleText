By the Queen.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty, foreseeing that in such resort and
concourse of people as commonly at the repair of great Ambassadors into this
her Highness Realm from foreign Princes is usually wont to be, there may
some disorder fall out amongst the inferior and meaner sort, which beside the
inconveniences likely to ensue thereby, might turn greatly to the dishonor of
her Majesty, a matter whereof her loving Subjects ought to have great regard,
especially at this time of the repair of so honorable personages hither, as
the like in such nombers has not of long time been sent unto any of her
predecessors from any foreign Prince or Potentate: Does therefore by this her
Highness Proclamation charge and command that no person or persons, during
the time of the continuance of the said Ambassadors and their retinue, within
this her Majesty's Realm, presume, after the publication of this present
Proclamation, to offer violence by drawing of any weapon, or to strike, hurt or
move quatels to any person of what Nation soever he be, upon pain of death to
be inflicted upon any person so offending, as a provision needful to be at
such a time excuted against manifest breakers of peace, to the dishonor of her
Majesty, and her Realm. And for her Majesty reputeth and takes the sending
of so Honorable personages and in so great a number unto her from her good
brother the French King, as a singular testimony of the princely good will and
affection he bears to her, and accordingly is desirous to make it appear to
the world by all the best effects and demonstrations of like good will and
affection she can, how greatly she accepts thereof, and thinks he self
honored thereby, does further look that her loving Subjects of all sorts,
shall not onley carry themselves in that orderly and quiet sort, during the time
of the abode of the said Honorable personages and Ambassadors here, as no
disorder or quarrel may fall out, But also that all Lords and Masters having
company of servants attending upon them, will so direct their companies to
observe the peace at this time, not only toward all strangers, but also all
others their own Countrymen, her Majesty's Subjects: So as on no part by any
means her Majesty's peace be broken during the abode of the said Ambassadors
here. Whereby they shall give a good demonstration and testimony not only of
their loyal devotion to her Majesty, and the care they have to do her that
honor, by all possible means they can (as in duty to them apperteyneth) but
also minister unto the said Honorable personages and strangers and their
trains, a just occasion to make good report of the good and peaceable
government under her Majesty, and of the obedience which her Subjects do
bear her Majesty, and also of the friendly usage and enterteinment they have
received here greatly to her Majesty's honor, and the honor of the Realm.

Given at her Majesty's Manor of S. James the xviii. day of April, 1581. in
the three and twentieth year of her Highness reign.

excellent Majesty.
