By the Queen
A Proclamation against the sowing of woade.
FOrasmuch as the Queens Majesty by many means understands, and specially
by complainte of great nombers of her people in counties using clothing and
tillage, and sustained by food coming of Dayries, (things necessary to be
mayntayned in her Realm, above any other new devise,) that a late attempt of
breaking up and tilling of very fertile grounds to sow woade, is upon a late
private and inordinate gain practiced, to the manifest grief of her people in
diverse places where the same is used: And that the excessive gain found
thereby, without regard to the public weal, is like both to continue and
increase this attempt, to ye great damage of ye common weal: Therefore, until
there may be a further consideration had, how the same may be suffered with
some tolleration and measure, in places convenient for the same, and not so
manifestly hurtful as now it is: Her Majesty by advise of her counsel
wills and commands, that no manner of person or persons of what degree
soever the same be, shall directly or indirectly after the publication hereof,
break up, or cause to be broken up, any manner of ground of what nature soever
it be, for the use or purpose to sow or plant woade in, neither that any
person do continue any ground already broken up for that purpose to the use
of woade, lying within four miles of any market town, or other town
occupying the common trade of clothing, or of any city within this Realm, or
within eight miles of any house of her Majesty's reserved for her access, upon
pain that whosoever shall attempt any thing to the contrary hereof, the
persons so doing, and the workmen that therein shall be employed, shall be
committed to the next common prison by the next Justices of peace, and there to
continue, until certificate be made thereof to her Majesty's privy counsel
by such as shall commit them, so as order may be taken for further punishment
of the persons offending, according to the quality of the offense.

And furthermore her Majesty wills, that all persons that have heretofore
broken up, and employed their grounds to the use of Woade, shall before the
feast of Christmas next, certify the Sheriff of ye county, or (in places
exempted) the principal officers, what quantity of grounds, and of what
nature the same were, and how the same were used before the conversion of them
to Woade, and in what parishes they do lie. In which certificate it shall be
contained, how near any of the said grounds lie to any of her Majesty's houses
above mentioned, or to any Cities or clothing towns, upon pain of
imprisonment of the parties that shall make default of such certificate. And
further, that they shall make certificate thereof into her Highness Exchequer
before the first day of Hillarie term next, upon pain of fine and
imprisonment, as hereafter shall seem convenient to her Majesty by advise of
her Counsel.

Given at her Majesty's Manor of Richmond, the fourteenth day of October, in
the seven and twentieth year of her Highness reign.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens most
excellent Majesty.
