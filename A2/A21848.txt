HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE royal blazon or coat of arms
By the Queen.
The Queens Majesty being given to understand, that diverse Soldiers upon the
dissoluing of the Camp at Tilberie in the county of Essex, have in their way
homeward sold diverse their Armors and weapons, which have been delivered unto
them by the Officers of those Counties where they have been levied and set out:
and besides the sale of their said Armor and weapons, have most falsely and
slanderously given out, that they were compelled to make sale of them for that
they received no pay, which is most untruly reported. For remedy whereof, her
Highness does straightly charge and command all her good and loving Subjects,
not only to forbear hereafter to bye any such Armors and weapons as shall be
offered unto them to be sold by any of the said Soldiers: but also immediately
upon any such offer, to take and apprehend the said Soldier, and to deliver
him or them into the hands of the next Constable, charging him by virtue of
this Proclamation in her Majesty's name, to carry him to the next Jail, and
shall see him committed, there to remain without bail or maineprise, until
there shall be some general order taken for the punishment of the said
parties. And further her Majesty's pleasure is, that such of her Subjects as
have since the dissoluing of the said Camp, bought any of the said Armor and
weapons before the publishing of this present Proclamation, shall within two
days after the publishing thereof, present unto the Mayor, or any other chief
Officer of that City, Town, or place where the said Armor has been bought,
the said Armor and weapons so by them bought: and shall by their corporal
oath declare unto the said Mayor, or chief Officer, what sum or sums of
money they have paid for the said Armor and weapons, and of whom the same
was bought, or of what band the party was that sold the same, to the end
there may some order be taken for the restitution of such sums of money as
have been by them disbursed. And in case any of her Majesty's Subjects shall be
by any means detected and proved to have transgressed against the true meaning
of this her Highness Proclamation, either in not confessing and bringing in to
the Officers aforesaid such Armors as they have bought in manner aforesaid, or
in buying hereafter any the said Armors to be offered as aforesaid unto them:
or in not apprehending any the foresaid Soldiers offering the sale of their
Armors: her Highness meaning is (besides her heavy displeasure to be
therefore sustained) that every such transgressor shall suffer for his offense,
not only imprisonment, but such further punishment in body or by sine, as by
her Majesty's privy Counsel shall be thought meet. The one moitie of the
said fine to be to the use of the detecter of the said Offender, and the other
moitie to be employed in provision of corn poulder, to the public benefit
of the County where the said Detecter shall dwell. And to the end this
Proclamation may take the better effect, her Highness pleasure and
commandment is, that all Justices of peace, and other inferior Ministers in
their several divisions of their Counties, make all diligent inquiry of all
offenses and Offenders against the true meaning of this present Proclamation.

Given at he Majesty's Manor of Saint James, the five and twentieth day of
August. 1588. In the thirtieth year of her Majesty's reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty.
