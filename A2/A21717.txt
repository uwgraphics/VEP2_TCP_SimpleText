(...)seneschall / and sir Fergus. And so by the advise of them all sir
Trystram was bannysshed out of the country of Cornewayle for ten year / and
thereupon he took his oath upon a book before the king and his barons / and so
he was made to depart out of the country of Cornewayle / and the were many
barons brought him unto his ship / of the which some were his friends and some
his foos. And in the mean while there came a knight of king Arthurs his name
was Dynadan / and his coming was to seek after sir Trystram then they showed
him where he was armed at all points going to the ship. Now fair knight said
sir Dynadan or ye pass this court yt ye will Just with me I require the /
With a good will said sir Trystram and these lords will give me leave. So the
barons granted thereto / and so they ran together / and there sir Trystram gaf
sir Dynadan a fall. And then he prayed sir Trystram to give him leave to go
in his felaushyp. Ye shall be right welcome said sir Trystram and so they took
their horses and rode to their ships together. And when sir Trystram was in
the sea he said. Great well king Mark and all mine enemies / and say them I
will come again whay I may. And well am I rewarded for the fighting with sir
Marhaus / and delivered all this country from seruage / and well am I rewarded
for the fetching and costs of queen Isoude out of Irlonde / and the danger
that I was in first and last / and by the way coming home what danger I had
to bring again queen Isoude from the castle Pluere / and well am I rewarded
when I fought with sir Bleoberys for sir Segwarydes wife / and well am I
rewarded when I fought with sir Blamor de ganys for king Anguysshe fader unto
la beale Isoude and well am I rewarded when I smote down the good knight sir
Lamerok de galys at king Marks request / and well am I rewarded when I fought
with the king with the hundred knights and the king of Northgalys / and both
these would have put his land in seruage / and by me they were put to a rebuke
/ and well am I rewarded for the sleynge of Tauleas the mighty gyau^t / and
many other deeds have I done for him / and now have I my waryson. And tell
king Mark that many noble knights of the table round have spared the barons
of this country for my sake. Also am I not well rewarded when I fought with the
good knight sir Palomydes and rescowed queen Isoude from him. And at that time
king Mark said before all his barons I should have been better rewarded / and
forth withal he took the sea.

How a damoysell sought help to help sir Lau^celot against. xxx. knights /
and how sir Trystram fought with them. ca. xxiij.
ANd at the next londynge fast by the sea there met with sir Trystram and
with sir Dynadan sir Ector de marys and sir Bors de ganys / and there sir Ector
Iusted with sir Dynadan / and he smote him and his horse down. And then sir
Trystram would have Iusted with sir Bors and sir Bors said that he would not
Just with no Cornysshe knights / for they are not called men of worship and
all this was done upon a bridge. and with this came sir Bleoberys and sir
Dryaunt / and sir Bleoberys profred to Just with sir Trystram / and there sir
Trystram smote down sir Bleoberys. Then said sir Bors de ganys. I wist never
Cornysshe knight of so great valor nor so valyau^t as that knight that bears
the trappours enbroudred with crowns. And then sir Trystram and sir Dynadan
departed fro them in to a forest / and there met them a damoysel that came for
the love of sir Lau^celot to seek after some noble knights of king Arthurs
court for to rescowe sir Lau^celot / and so there was ordained for sir
Lancelot by the treason of queen Morgan le fay to have slain sir Lau^celot /
and for that cause she ordained. xxx. knights to lie in a wait for sir
Lau^celot / and this damoysell knew this treason. And for this cause the
damoysell came to seek noble knights to help sir Lau^celot / for that night
or the day after sir Lau^celot should come where these.xxx. knights were. And
so this damoysel met with sir Bors sir Bleoberys sir Ector and sir Dryaunt /
and there she told them all four of the treason of Morgan le fay / and then
the promised her that they would be nyghe where sir Lau^celot should mete with
the.xxx. knights / and if so be that they set upon him we will do rescowes
as we can. So the damoysell departed / and by adventure the damoysell met
with sir Trystram and with sir Dynadan / and there the damoysell told them all
the treason that was ordained for sir Lau^celot. Fair damoysell said Trystram
bring me to yt same place where they should mete with sir Lancelot. Then
said sir Dynadan what will ye do / hit is not for us to fight with.xxx.
knights / and wete you well I will not thereof / as to match one knight or two
or three is enough and they be men. But for to match.xv. knights that will I
never undertake. Fie for shame said sir Trystram do but your part Nay said sir
Dynadan I will not thereof / but if ye will lene me your shield / for ye bear a
shield of Cornewayle / and for the cowardyse that is named to the knights of
Cornewayle ye be ever forborne Nay said sir Trystram I will not depart from my
shield for her sake that gaf it me. But one thing said sir Trystram I promise
the sir Dynadan but if thou wylt promise me to abide with me / here I shall
slay the. For I desire no more of the but answer one knight / and if thy
heart will not serve the stand by and look upon me and them. Sir said sir
Dynadan I promise you to look upon and do what I may to save my self / but I
would that I had not met with you. So then anon these.xxx. knights came
fast by these four knights / and they were ware of them / and either of
other. And so these.xxx. knights let for this cause yt they would not wrath
them if cause be yt they had ado with sir Lau^celot / and the four knights
let them pass to this intent that they would see and behold what they would
do with sir Lau^celot / and so the.xxx. knights past on / and came by sir
Trystram and by sir Dynadan / and then sir Trystram cried on high / loo here
is a knight against you for the love of sir Lau^celot / and there he slew two
with one spear and.x. with his sword And then came in sir Dynadan and he
did passing well / and so of the.xxx. knights there went but.x. away and
they fled. All this battle saw sir Bors de ganys and his three fellows / and
then they saw well hit was the same knight that Iusted with them at the
bridge / then they took their horses and rode unto sir Trystram and praised
him and thanked him of his good deeds / and they al desired sir Trystram to go
with them to their lodging / and he said nay he would not go to no lodging.
Then they all four knights prayed him to tell them his name Fair lords
said sir Trystram / as at this time I will not tell you my name.

How sir Trystram and sir Dynadan came to a lodging where they must Just
with two knights. ca. xxiiij.
UHenne sir Trystram and sir Dynadan rode forth on their way till they came to
the shepherdes and to the herd men / and there they asked them if they knew
any lodging or herberowe there nyghe hand. Forsothe syrs said the herd men /
here by is good lodging in a castle / but there is such a custom that there
shall no knight be herberowed but if he Just with two knights / and if ye be
but one knight he must Just with two / and as ye be therein soon shall ye be
matched. So there is shrewde herberowe said sir Dynadan / lodge where yt ye
will for I will not lodge there. Fie for shame said sir Trystram are ye not a
knight of the table round / wherefore ye may not with your worship refuse your
lodging. Not so said the herd men / for and ye be beten and have the wors ye
shall not be lodged there / and if ye beat them ye shall be well herberowed. A
said sir Dynadan they are two sure knights / then sir Dynadan would not
lodge there in no manner / but as sir Trystram required him of his knyghthode /
and so they rode thither / and to make short tale sir Trystram and sir Dynadan
smote hem down both / and so they entered in to the castle and had good chere
as well as they could think or deuyse / and when they were unarmed and thought
to be merry and in good rest / there came in at the yates sir Palomydes and sir
Gaherys requyrynge to have the custom of the castle. What arraye is this said
sir Dynadan. I would have my rest / That may not be said sir Trystram now must
we needs defend the custom of this castle / in so much as we have the
better of the lords of this castle / and therefore said sir Trystram needs must
ye make you ready. In the deuyls name said sir Dynadan came I in to your company
/ and so they made them ready. And sir Gaherys encountered with sir Trystram /
and sir Gaherys had a fall and sir Palomydes encou^tred with sir Dynadan and
sir Dynadan had a fall / then^e was hit fall for fall. So then must they
fight on foot / that would not sir Dynadan for he was so sore brysed of the
fall yt sir Palomydes gaf him. Then sir Trystram unlaced sir Dynadans helm
and prayed him to help him. I will not said sir Dynadan / for I am sore wounded
of the.xxx. knights that we had but late agoo to do withal. But ye fare said
sir Dynadan unto sir Trystram as a mad man and as a man that is out of his
mind yt would cast himself away / and I may curse the time that ever I saw
you. For in all the world are not such two knights that been so wood as is
sir Lau^celot and ye sir Trystram / for ones I fell in the felaushyp of sir
Lau^celot as I have done now with you and he set me a work that a quarter of
a year I kept my bed. Ihesu defend me said sir Dynadan from such two
knights / and specially from your felaushyp. Then said sir Trystram I will
fight with them both. And so sir Trystram badde them come forth both / for I
will fight with you. And then sir Palomydes and sir Gaherys dressyd them and
smote at them both / and then^e sir Dynadan smote at sir Gaherys a stroke or
two / and turned from him. Nay said sir Palomydes it is to much shame for us
two knights to fight with one / and then he did bydde sir Gaherys stand a
side with that knight yt has no list to fight / And then^e they rode together
and fought long / and at the last sir Trystram doubled his strokes and drofe
sir Palomydes a back more than three thrydes And then by one assente sir
Gaherys and sir Dynadan went betwixt them and departed them in sonder. And
then by assente of sir Trystram they would by assente of sir Trystram they
would have lodged together. But sir Dynadan would not lodge in that castle /
and then^e he cursed the time that ever he came in their felaushyp / and so he
took his horse and his harneys and departed / then sir Trystram prayed the
lords of that castle to lene him a man to bring him to a lodging / and so
they did and ouertoke sir Dynadan and rode to their lodging two mile thens
with a good man in a pryory and there they were well at ease. And that same
night sir Bors and sir Bleoberys and sir Ector and sir Dryau^t abode stylle in
the same place there as sir Trystram fought with the.xxx. knights / and there
they met with sir Lau^celot the same night / and had made promise to lodge
with sir Colgreuau^ce the same night.

How sir Trystram Iusted with sir Pray and sir Sagramor le desyrus / and how
sir Gawayne turned Trystram fro Morgan le fay. ca. xxv.
But anon as the noble knight sir Lau^celot herd of the shield of Cornewayle
then wist he well that hit was was sir Trystram that fought with his enemies /
and then^e sir Lau^celot praised sir Trystram and called him the man of most
worship in the world. So there was a knight in that pryory that hight
Pellynore / and he desired to wete ye name of sir Trystram but in no wise he
could not / and then sir Trystram departed and left sir Dynadan in the
pryory / for he was so weary and so brysed that he might not ride. And then
this knyt sir Pellynore said to sir Dynadan / sythen that ye will not tell me
that knights name / then will I ride after him and make him to tell me (...)
