TO The right Honorable and his much honored Lo. Thomas Lo. Brudenel, Baron of
Stauton.
Right honorable, and my very good Lo.
YOur singular knowledge in all excellent, and solid Literature, and your ever
Heroicke, and Noble disposition to the best kinds of Learning, are not unknown
unto the world; And amongst other studies in your Lo. minority at the
University, you took no little affection, to the Mathematical Arts, as by
your Lo. own Manu-scripts and excellent Books in your Lo. great Library I
have often seen; Besides, not only by mine own sundry conferences with your
Lo. but also by the relation of others of more mature judgment I have bin
amply informed in these your L. more aged years not only of your continued
love to these Arts, but also that your knowledge in them far exceedes many of
the Nobility of this kingdom. Now my L. when I caused the subject of this
Tractat to be made for your Lo. last Summer (I mean your Lo. Horizontall
Quadrant) I had not then any intention so soon to have written publicly upon
it; But, having then but declared unto your Lo. the excellent and abundant use
of the Instrument by the heads of the propositions then slightly compiled,
(far exceeding the Isntrumental way in this nature, that either Nobility,
Gentry, or others are now acquainted with in this kingdom, for a recreative
Instrument, as well for the copious use thereof, as its great facility, and
expedition in operation) your Lo. then encouraging me to the publishing of it
for a general end; many Months after I considered thereon: and drew it up
into a Body, and thus accommodated it, as I here present it now unto your Lo.
favorable censure, and Patronage (to be sheltred under the wings of your Lo.
clemency against all calumniators and malevolents) as belonging especially to
your Lo. since you were the sole motive to this work, and had both the use of
the Instrument before it came thus to a public view, and the first Quadrant
that ever was made common in this kind: accept therefore favorably I beseech
your Lo. this small mite of my labors, as from the hands of one of your
poorest servants (yet true affectionate) who shall always acknowledge your Lo.
Nobleness toward him, and ever rest

Your Lo. most humbly devoted to Honor and serve you De la main.

To the Reader.
BEfore I show the Projection, describe the particulars, and deliver the uses
of this Horizontall Quadrant, it will not be impertinent, for the satisfaction
of some, to give the Reader to understand what moved me unto it, how it exceeds
other Instruments, and whence it might be drawn, and projected.

Now the ingenious aptness for Invention, and accomodating of things in a
fair and expedite course for Mathematical Practices, of that late professor
of Astronomy Mr. Gunter is not unknown unto many about this kingdom,
satisfying many of his friends (according to his free and noble affection) by
Transcripts in that of more solid matter, but such of vulgar Practices he has
publicly made manifest for the use of all such as affect those Studies. In
which work many years past I took occasion to consider the Scheme, or
Diagramme of the fourth Projection in his Book of the Sector Page the 64. and
65. which according as he says is after the manner of the old Concaue hemisphere
(but being in truth a natural Projection of the visible Hemisphere, that is,
one Moytie of the Globe, projected on a Plain) which Diagram and Projection is
now challenged by my Reverend good friend Master Oughtred, and it should seem
that Master Gunter had the Original of it from his labors, and invention, who
composed and made the same so, for more then thirty years past, as appears by
his own Writings, and Manuscripts upon that Protection shown me in the time
of the Printing of this Tractat upon my Horizontall Quadrant, whose excellent
knowledge in Mathematical Learning may evidently confirm it: which Projection
the said Master Oughtred gave to the late Bishop of Winchester, Doctor Bilson,
for more then 20. years past, and to some others of very good quality.

And it may also, by a Letter from that most famous and admired Geometer,
Master Henry Brigges unto Master Oughtred dated from Gresham College June, the
2. Anno. 1618. be collected that the said Master Gunter had the first overture
of that fourth Projection, from the said Master Oughtred, in which letter are
these words: Master Gunter does here send you the Print of an Horizontall Dial
of his drawing after your Instrument; And afterward the said Projection was
also presented by Master Gunter to many Noble Personages, and in particular to
the Right Honorable the Earl of Bridgewater, causing it to be cut in Brass,
in such a form a^ I have placed at the end of this Tractat, some uses of which
Dial are extant, viz. the 2. 18. 21. and 34. Pro. of the Index or Table
following.

Now having considered diverse Pocket Instruments (that many men are practiced
in) and looked into sundry Projections, amongst which that of Gemmafrisius
(there drawn in the Book of the Sector) is of admirable use, yet making a
more serious quaere, and contemplating more intensively upon that Diagram,
drawn and specified in that 64. and 65. Pages of the Sector (aforesaid) I
found it far to exceed all others in the Multiplicity, and excellency of
performance.

If I should add unto it a Calendar of time, and an Index graduated with an
Axis, and Perpendiculars to be erected upon it at pleasure: and referring only
the Trapeziall form, it should be fitted far to exceed any portable
Instrument for the Pocket, ever yet produced in respect of the general uses of
it: in resolving such ordinary Propositions which are practiced in Astronomy,
upon the Globe, Sphere, Hemispheare, Quadrants of all sorts, Astrolabe of
Frisius, Blagraue, and others for facility, expedition, or certainty, (like
Magnitudes considered) for in these Instruments for several times, and
several Propositions, there must be diverse rectifications of the parts
belonging to these Instruments, and that diversely by reason of their diversity:
By this Horizontall Quadrant, the former redifications are avoided,
Contemplation and the eye being only the Index, the aptness, and fitness of
the parts, and lines so naturally projected, or described as they are upon the
plain of the Instrument (being a part of the Horizon the Parallels Meridians,
and Vertical Circles, that are contained or may be described in our Latitude
sufficiently necessary) induces any one in the understanding of the uses of it
that is but indifferently versed in the linaments and principles of the Globe,
what to speak, and what to answer in a Proposition without farther direction:
And having had this Horizontall Quadrant for many years past, as a Pocket
Instrument, diverse about this Kingdom being importunate with me for to have
it, or to publish the use of it, seeing its great facility, and expedition, in
comparison of such Pocket Instruments as are now used, here, or in foreign
parts: I was willing at last after I had given order for the making of four of
these Instruments in Silver for several Noble Personages, to disburthen my
self of Transcribing the uses of the Instrument, and Tables for the making of
it, to satisfy those which were importunate, and to let others that are
studious in Mathematical Practices also participate of it.

Now, what I have delivered upon the accommodating of the Instrument thus, the
making thereof, with the uses that I have delivered in this Tractat upon it
following: I acknowledge due to none Inferior assistant, but to mine own
Industry, search and labor, and that 64. 65. and 66. Pages of the Book: of
the Sector before specified in which is only shown the 2. 3. 19. 22. 25. and
30. Propositions of the Index, or Table following, as uses of the said
Projection.

But I have extended them to many more, and abundantly, and plentifully
supplied the obscurity of that Scheme, or Diagramme there drawn (as for a
general good) in the use of this Horizantal Quadrant. I deliver therefore first
the making of it, first by the Sector (somewhat different from that of Master
Gunters) secondly by Geometry, and lastly I show a third way, how it may be
Proiected and made by my Mathematical Ring, and by Numbers, which I have
Calculated and accommodated to that end in Tables, for more exactness. Part of
the general scope, and use of which Instrument I deliver in the Index, or
Table following.

operated.

Of the Making of the Horizontall Quadrant by the Sector.
1. How to describe the Parallels.
FIrst, according to any Semidiameter as Z N. or Z S. describe a Circle
representing the Horizon, and draw the line S N. for the Meridian: Divide the
half Meridian Z N. and Z S. into 90. gr. according to the Tangents of half
their Arkes, by the help of the Sines on the edge of the Sector: or the
semidiameters may be divided into such parts, or points as are required
concerning the Projection, thus. Consider what parallels you would describe,
and how much they are distant from the Zenith in their intersections, in the
Meridian both toward the South and North of the Zenith (for every parallel in
an oblique Sphere, in his intersection with the Meridian, is farther from the
Zenith in one part, than in an other) Then if the semidiameter Z N. be placed
over in the sign Complement of half that distance, from the Zenith, the
parallel Sine of the former half taken from the Sector: shall from show the
intersection in the Meridian with that parallel.

gr. m. gr. m. So if the paralles were the Tropicke of whose distances of
intersections in the Meridian (according to the Lat. of 51. gr. 30. m.) from Z.
toward S. the South is 28. 0. The half of these Arks are 14.00. A N. the
North 105.0, 52.30. B Equator S. the South 51.30. 25.45. C N. the North 128.30
64.15. D Tropicke of S. the South 75.30. 37.30. E N the North 152.0. 76.00. F

Now if the semidiameter Z. S. be placed in the Sine Complement of A. viz. 76.
gr. and then the parallel Sine of A taken, viz. 14. gr. it will reach from Z.
to. the intersection of the Tropicke of with the South part of the Meridian,
but if the semidiameter Z. S. be placed over in the Sine Complement. B. viz.
37. gr. 30. m. and then the parallel Sine of B. viz. 52. gr. 30. m. being
taken it will reach from Z to V. the other intersection of the Tropicke of 69
with the Meridian below the Pole, the Middle between this V. and 69. will be
at 1. which is the Center of that Tropicke: In like manner may be found the
intersections, and Centers of the other parallels with the Meridians, and so
may be described.

2. To describe the hour lines
Secondly, seeing the Lat. is 51. gr. 30. take the Semidiameter Z S. and fit it
over in the Sine Complement of it, viz. 38. gr. 30. then the parallel sine of
51. gr. 30. m. will reach from Z. to T. the center of the hour of 6. E P W.
but if the Radius Z S. be fitted over in the Sine Complement of half 38. gr.
30. viz. 70. gr. 45. m. and the parallel sine of half 38. gr. 30. viz. 19.
gr. 15. m. be taken, it will reach from Z. to P. the Pole, then upon T. erect a
perpendicular to the line P T. viz. 2. T. 10. which shall serve for the finding
of the Centers of the Meridians, or hour Circles passing through the Pole P.
now seeing that T P. is the nearest distance in the right line 2. 10. unto P.
the right line P. T. shall be Radius, to a Circle, and the line 2. T. 10. shall
be a Tangent line to that Circle. Now the Radius of a Circle being known, the
Tangent of any Angle, or Arc, may be also known, according to the Natural
projection and congruity of lines, but because in this first direction we would
apply it soly to the Sector: the center of the Meridians or hours may be had
by the help of the Sines thereon thus.

Consider what hour, or Meridian circle from the hour of 6. viz. E, P, W. you
would discribe, for then if the Radius P, T. be fitted over in the Sine
complement of it and the parallel Sine of the hour Angle Taken, it will show
from T, in the line 2. 10. the center of that Meridian, or hour circle: so if
the hour circle of 5. or 7. were to be described, whose hour Angle at P, the
Pole is 15. gr. fit the Radius or semediameter T, P. over in the Sine
complement of it viz. 75. gr. for then the Sine perallell of 15. gr. being
taken will reach from T, to 5. and from T, to 7, the Center of the hour
circles of 5 and 7. If therefore one foot of the Cumpasses be placed in 5. and
then extended to P. the Pole, you may describe the hour Circle of 5. and
placed in 7. you may draw the hour Circle of 7. and so may be described the
rest of the Meridians. and hour Circles.

3 To describe and divide the Eclipticke
Thirdly, to describe the Eclipticke, consider the distances between the
Zenith Z. and the Tropicks of. and 69. according to the former Lat. of 51. gr.
30. which will be Z, 75. gr. and Z.. 28. gr. then take the semideameter Z, S.
and fit it over in the Sine of those Arkes, then the parallel Sines of the
Complements of those Arkes will show from Z. the distances of the Centers of
these Tropicall points, so the Center of the Southern semicircle of the
Eclipticke, will be near the Pole P, viz. at. and the Center of the Northern
semicircle of the Eclipticke will be below the Pole at. Therefore placing one
foot of the Cumpasses in. below the Pole, and extending the other foot to.
above the Pole you may describe the semicircle E,. W. and placing one foot in.
near the Pole, you may describe the semicircle, E,, W.

Now for the dividing of the Eclipticke; this Mr. Gunter delivers so obstrusly
in his 66, page of the Sector. That if a man had not more fundamental
Mathematical Doctrine, then his Book teaches, he should never attain unto
it: Consider therefore first, what right Angle Triangles there are made by this
Eclipticke, Equator and Meridians, viz, B. or B: R. or R, etc. and get the
right ascension of these Arkes of the Eclipticke hat you intend to divide, so,
B. is the right ascension of the Arkes,, and,. and, R. is the Right asention of
Arkes,, and,, from which ground the Table S. is calculated according to the
Arkes in the Eclipticke in the Table R. Now to find the Centers of those
Meridians which may divide the Eclipticke according to the Right ascension here
calculated answerable to R. S. 5 4.45 10 9.11 15 13.48 20 18.27 25 23.09 30
27.54 35 32.42 40 37.35 45 42.31 50 47.33 55 52.38 60 57.48 65 63.03 70 68.21
75 73.43 80 79.07 85 84.32 90 90.00 the Arkes of the Eclipticke from or it
nothing differs from the instruction of the describing of the hour Circles,
in the second derection: for if I would intersect the Eclipticke in the
beginning of... or. the distance of either of those singcs from or is 30. gr.
against which in the Table, S. is 27. gr. 54. m. Now if the semidiamiter P T.
be fitted over in the sine Complement of this 27. gr. 54. m. viz. 68. gr. 6. m.
and then the parallel sine of 27. gr. 54. m. being taken it will reach from T.
to 30. in the line 2. T. 10. if therefore one foot of the Compasses be placed
in 30. toward 10. and the other foot extended to P. you may intersect the
Eclipticke in. and. and then the Compasses placed in the other 30. you may
intersect the other part of the Eclipticke in and. and so may you divide the
rest of the Eclipticke.

Of the making of the Horizontall Quadrant Geometrically.
FIrst, having discribed a Cirrle at pleasure as before, E. S. W. N. draw a
line to pass by the center as S. N. and cross it at right Angles, with the
line E. W. in Z. then let the semcircles W S E and W N E. be divided from W.
each of them into 180. gr. or rather upon E. we may discribe a Quadrant at
pleasure, as C D. and augmenting it unto o, divide the Quadrant D C. from D.
into the usual divisions of a Quadrant, and so from D. unto o, insert or
protract the same divisions, then having considered as before the Latitude of
the place, and distance of the parallels from Z. the Zenith, toward S. the
South, and also toward N. the North, in the Meridian as in the former Table
there is specified. Account the distance of the parallels from the Zenith
toward S. the South, in the semicircle W S E. but those toward N the North,
in the semicircle W N E. from W. so supposing the Latitude as before to be 51.
gr. 30. 1 To describe the parallels.
m. the distance between the Zenith and the Tropicke of 69. toward the South,
is 28. gr. which account from W. to F. but rather half of it from D. to F.
then consider the distance between the Zenith and the other part beyond the
Pole, viz. 105. gr. number this from W. to G. but rather half uf it from D. to
G. and laying a ruler upon E. F. and E. G. the Meridian A B. may be intersected
in 69. and V. the middle, between which will be at 1. the Center of the
Tropicke: in like manner the distance of the Equator from the Zenith toward
the South is 51. gr 30. reckon it from W. to H. or half of it from D. to H.
but the distance of the Aequater from the Zenith toward the North beyond the
Pole is 128. gr. 30. m. which I account from W. to I. or half of it from D. to
I, then laying a ruler upon E. H. and E. I. the Meridian A B. may be
intersected in Q and Y. the half distance between Q and Y. will be at 2. the
Center of the Aequater: In like manner may the Meridian A B. be divided into
any of the rest of the divisions, and the parallels also discribed: But if a
ruler be fastened to move upon E. then may you softly move the ruler from D.
toward o. and as it passet by the degrees according to the Colume B. of the
Tables following, beginnig at the bottom, so the edge of the ruler shall show
the intersections that the parallels of declination between the Tropickes do
make, with the Meridian Z. S. then move the Ruler softly along from D. toward
C. as it passes by the degrees in the Colume G. beginning at the bottom, so
the edge of the Ruler shall intersect the Meridian A. B. in the Centers of
those parallels.

Secondly, account the Latitude from D to M. and half D to R. and laying a
ruler upon E M. and E R. the Meridian, S N. shall be intersected in T. and P.
P. representing the Pole of the world, 2 To describe the hour lines
and T the center of the hour of 6. then unto the line T P. upon the point T.
erect a perpendicular 2. 10. and according to the semidiameter P T. describe a
semicircle a T. divide the Quadrants T a and T. from T. each of them into 90.
gr. then lay a ruler upon P. and the several hour Arkes in the Quadrants, T
a. and T. intersect the line 2. T. 10. in the hour points, 2. 3. 4. 5. 7. 8.
9. 10. etc. then placing the Compasses in T. and extending the other foot to
P. you may discribe the hour Circle of 6. but placing it in 5. and extended to
P. you may discribe the hour Circle of 5. the same extent placed in 7. will
discribe the hour Circle of 7. and so of the rest: but if a ruler be fastened
to move on P. as it passes by the degrees of the hours in the Quadrants from
T. so the edge of the Ruler shall intersect the line 2. 10. in the Centers of
those hours from T.

3. To describe and divide the Eclipticke.
Thirdly, to describe the Eclipticke, consider the Altitude of each Tropicke
above the Horizon, according to the Latitude given, which was 51. gr. 30. m. So
the Altitude of. is 15. gr. and that of 69. is 62. gr. In the Quadrant D C.
account those degrees from D. viz. D y and D d. lay a ruler upon E. and those
several points, so may the Meridian S. N. be intersected in the points. and
69. which are the Centers of the semicircles of the Eclipticke, therefore
placing one foot of the Compasses in 69. below the Pole, and extending the
other foot to 69. above the Pole, you may discribe the Northeren semicircle E.
69. W. and placing one foot of the Compasses in. near the Pole, and extending
the other foot to. near S. you may describe the Southern semicircle E W.
those semicircles of the Eclipticke may be divided Geometrically, without the
help of the Table of right ascension, but for more expedition we may use them
thus. In the Quadrants T a. and T. account the degrees of the right ascension
for such divisions of the Eclipticke as you intend to have, suppose the
beginning of or the distances of the beginning of any of these signs, fromithe
Equinoctial points are equal the one unto the other. viz. 30. gr which find
in the Table under R. so right against it under S. is 27. gr. 54. m. this
account from T. toward a. and. and laying a ruler upon P. and those degrees
intersect the Tangent line 2. 10. in 30. and then placing one foot of the
Compasses in 30. toward 10. and extending the other foot to P. you may
intersect the Eclipticke in the beginning of.. and so in. the points required:
In the likemanner you may divide the other part of the Eclipticke. So the
Centers of the degrees of the Eclipticke may be sooner had, if a ruler be
placed upon P. and then to move thereon, Now as it passes by the degrees of
the Columes I.O. in tha Tables following from T. in the several Quadrants: so
the Ruler shall Intersect the line 2. to in the Centers of those Arkes
answerable to the columes K N. the degrees of the Ecliptic.

3. By my Ring it may be otherwise projected: In which it exceeds any
Instrument whatsoever for facility, and expedition, for where there is many
proportionals required in any service, there the use of the Ring is most
excellently made manifest, they being instantly declared at once, which in some
sort I have delivered in the use of my Appendix upon plain Triangles, or it
may be drawn from that of Proportionating the Fort, to the Fort, or the
Building, to the Building, Page the 2. and 3.
LEt a Circle be discribed according to any capacity, diametrall lines at
right Angles E Z W. and S Z N. then take the semidiameter E Z. and divide it
into 10. parts, and supdivide each of those parts into 10. or 100. (according
to the capacity of the scale) as A. or more accurately according to the same
Radius make a diagonall seal, then consider the distance of the parallels from
the Zenith according to the Latitude you intend, as admit 51. gr. 30. m. to be
the Latitude as before. Take the half of those distances (according to the
first directions) by which is made the Colume B. which are the half distances
of every degree between the Tropickes and the Zenith, then move the Tangent of
45. gr. unto the parts of the Radius or semidiameter, viz. 10000. in the Circle
of Numbers, so right against the Tangent of any one of those degrees in the
Colume B. Of the calculating of the Numbers, to describe the parallels.
in the moveable is the Number of equal parts in the fixed, by which is made
the Colume C. (or they may be extracted out of the Tables of natural
Tangents.) Further if we consider the distance between the Zenith and the
other intersections of those parallels, with the Meridian beyond the Pole, and
take half of those distances we may make the Colume D. then moving the
moveable softly along, as the Tangent of any degree of the Colume D. in the
moveable, passes by the parts of the scall, viz. 10000. in the fixed (on the
Circle of Numbers) so the Tangent of 45. gr. in the moveable, shall point out
in the Circle of Numbers, the distance between Z. and those parallels beyond
the Pole. From these directions are calculated the Numbers in the Colume E. or
they may be also taken from the Table of natural Tagents as before: The
Numbers of the Colume C and E. serve to find the distances of the
intersections of the parallels in the Meridian from Z. and to discribe those
parallels, note that at the bottom of the Columes C. and E. are the Numbers,
2493. and 13032. take 2493. from the diagonall scale, and protract it from Z.
toward S. viz. at. then take from the same scale also, 13032. and protract it
from Z. to. below N. divide the space between. and. into two equal parts
which will be at 1. near P. so have you the Center of the Tropicke of. extend
the Compasses therefore from 1. to. then may you describe that Tropicke, viz.
d.. z. In like manner may you draw the other parallels, but for more ease we
may take half of the differences of the Numbers in the Colume C and the Colume
E. and so may we have the Colume F. and then wi h greater expedition we may
protract the Centers of these parallels, from Z. for if 5269. which is at the
bottom of the Colume F. (and between the former two Numbers) be taken from
the scale, and protracted from Z. it will reach unto 1. the Center as before,
and so any Number in the Colume F. is the distance of the Centers from Z. of
his opposite Number in the Colume B. or A. by which Columes C. and F. you may
describe all the parallels, between the Tropicks from degree to degree.

23 38.53 23.30 39.50 to show in what points of the Arc d. E. p. the parallels
of declination intersect it, if truly described, and may be found by Page 57.
of the Appendix upon the Ring, where is shown to find what Amplitude
belongs to the Suns declination, for any Latitude by moving the Sine of the
Complement of the Latitude, uiz. this of London, 38. gr. 30. m. unto the sine
of 90. in the fixed, so every degree of declination in the moveable, shall
point out the Amplitude in the fixed by which is had the Numbers of the Colume
T. the suns Amplitude belonging to the declination of the Colume R. Now if the
Quadrants E S. EN. WS. W N. be divided from E and W. a ruler laid upon the
Center Z. and to pass by the degrees in the several Quadrants, answerable to
the degrees of the Colume T. the Arkes d p. and z. shall be noted in such
points as the parallels of the declination should intersect.

Secondly, move the Tangent of the Latitude in the moveable viz. 51 gr. 30. m.
unto the former part of the Radius or scale. viz. 10000. in the Circle of
Numbers in the fixed, so the Tangent of 45. gr. in the movable shall point out
125717. in the Circle of Numbers in the fixed, which taken from the scale A.
and protracted from Z. to T. it shall be the Center of the hour of 6. upon T.
erect a perpendicular 2. T. 10. serving for the Centers of the other hours:
then move the Tangent of 45: gr. to the parts of the scale, viz. 10000 in the
Circle of Numbers, and consider the distance between the Zenith and the Pole,
viz. 38. gr. 30. m. the Tangent of half of it in the movable does point out in
the Circle of Numbers 34921. which taken also from the diagonall scale, and
protracted from Z. will reach to P. the Pole, through which all the hours must
be drawn, and the Centers of which hours in the line 2.10. from T. may be had
thus: which two numbers 125717. and 34921. I place over the Columes H. and I.

Of the calculating of the distances of the Centers of the hours
According to the distance P.T. make a scale B. (or rather a diagonall scale)
to contain 10000. parts, then move the Tangent of 45. gr. to the parts of this
scale in the Circle of Numbers, viz. 10000. so every degree in the mouable
amongst the Tangents unto 45. gr. does point out in the Circle of Numbers, the
distances of the Centers of those degrees from T. in the line 2. 10. by which
the Colume H. is made, then moving the moveable softly along as the Tangent of
any degree in the movable above 45. gr. passes by the parts of the scale B.
viz. 10000. in the Circle of Numbers, so the Tangent of 45. gr. in the
moveable, passes by the distance of the Centers of those degrees from T. in
the Circle of Numbers in the fixed, above 10000. by which is made up the rest
of the Colume H. viz. I. by help of which Colume H. and I. the hours may be
thus drawn.

Of the describing of the hours
Mark, what Numbers are against the hours in the Colume H and I. for if those
Numbers be taken from the scale B. and protracted from T. in the line 2.10.
they shall be the Centers of those hours: so in the Colume H. against the
hour of 7. or 5. is 2679, which take from the scale B. and protract it from T.
to 7. and from T. to 5. in the line 2. 10. then placing one foot of the
Compasses in 7. and extending the other foot to P. describe the hour of 7.
and one foot of the Compasses at the same extent being placed in 5. shall also
describe the hour of 5. In like manner may be protracted from T. out of the
Colume H. I. the Centers of the other hours with their intermediats, and so
also described.

But here note, that it were convenient to find the Intersections of the hour
lines (and their intermediate degrees) with the Horizon as before was delivered
of the intersections of the parallels of Declination with the Horizon, and it
may be drawn from my Ring thus. Of the finding the intersection of the hour

the fixed, then right against the Tangent of any degree from the hour of 6. in
the fixed, is the Tangent of the degrees of the intersection of the hours, and
the intermediate degrees with the Horizon in the moveable: from which direction
is this Table drawn, and is only for these degrees which intersect the
Horizon in the Calender, but it might have been extended further. The
Application of which is thus: Account in the Limb of the Instrument from E.
(the point of East,) any degree in the Colume B. and lay a Ruler thereto, and
to the Center Z. so the intersection thereof in the Horizon shall show the
intersection that the hour line, or degree opposite thereunto in the Colume A.
makes with the Horizon. In like manner I might have delivered the Tables of
the intersection of the hour lines with the parallels of declination, which
would serve of great use in large Instruments, to describe these degrees, which
are near the hour of 12.

Now to describe the Ecliptic, consider as before the hight of the Tropicks
above the Horizon, in the Latitude given, viz. 51. gr, 30. m. so will be 15.
above the Horizon, and will be 62. gr. high. Then move the Tangent of 45. unto
the parts of the scale A. in the Circle of Numbers in the fixed. viz. 10000. so
right against the Tangent of 15. gr. in the moveable is 2679. the distance of
the Center of the Southern semicircle of the Eclipticke from Z. which I place
in the Colume over M. and against. then move the moveable softly along until
the Tangent of 62 gr. be right against 10000. To describe the Eclipticke
in the Circle of Numbers, so the Tangent of 45. gr. in the moveable, shall
point out 18807. on the Circle of Numbers in the fixed: The distance of the
Center of the Northern semicircle of the Eclipticke, from Z. which I place in
the Colume over P. against. if these numbers be taken from the scale A. and
protracted from Z. they will reach from Z. to. and from Z. to, and so placing
one foot of the Compasses in. near the Pole, and extending the other foot
to. near S. you may describe the Southern semicircle of the Eclipticke E,. W.
and placing one foot of the Compasses in. below the Pole, and extending the
other foot to. above the Pole: you may describe the Northern part of the
Eclipticke E,, W. and those semicircles of the Eclipticke may be divided as
follows.

Move the Tangent of 45. unto the Sine of 66. and 30. so right against the
Tangent of the degrees of the Suns Longitude in the Eclipticke in the
moveable, How to make the Table to divide the Eclipticke
are the Tangents of the degrees of the Suns right ascension in the fixed, or
they may be had by resolving of a Triangle, in which there will be 9^. several
operations, but by this Ring they are given at one rectification, and only by
a glance of the eye: for proportionals either in Sines or Tangents are had by
the Ring, with the same expedition that Numbers are had, As by the use of the
Circles of Sines and Tangents upon the projection of this Ring, in diverse
particulars is declared in the Appendix upon the use of the Ring; and so
according to the former Construction is made the Columes L. and O. for 45.
being brought to 66. gr. 30. m. as before, right against 10. gr. in the
moveable, is 9. gr. 11. m. in the fixed, against 20. gr. in the moveable, is
18. gr. 28. m. in the fixed, and so of the rest. Then move the Tangent of 45.
gr. to the parts of the scale B. viz. 10000. in the Circle of Numbers, so right
against the Tangent of the Arkes in the Colume L. in the moveable are the
distances of the Centers of those Arks, from T. in the Circle of Numbers in the
fixed, and so is made the Colume M. and if you move the moveable softly along
as the Tangent of any degree in the Colume O. passes by 10000 the parts of the
scale B. so the Tangent of 45. in the moveable, passes by the distances of the
Centers of those degrees from T. in the Circle of Numbers in the fixed, by
which is made the Colume P. or they may be had from the Table of natural
Tangents.

Then by the scale B. protract the Numbers, To divide the Eclipticke.
out of the Colume M. and P. from T. in the line 2. 10. for they shall be the
Centers of those degrees of the Eclipticke, which are opposite unto them, viz.
in the Columes K. and N. so if I would intersect the Eclipticke, in the
beginning of... or. each being distant from. 30. gr. which I seek in the
Colume. K. and find right against it in the Colume M. 5294. which I take from
the scale B. and protract it from T. to 30. in the line 2. 10. Now placing one
foot of the Compasses in 30. next 10. and extending the other foot to P. the
Eclipticke may be intersected in the points of. and. and placed in 30. toward
2. the same extent will Intersect the Eclipticke in. and. In like manner may
the Centers of the rest of the degrees of the Eclipticke be protracted in the
line, 2. 10. from T. out of the Columes M. and P. and so all the Eclipticke
divided from degree, to degree: but this may be otherwise done.

Besides that which is delivered touching the drawing of the Parallels,
Eclipticke, and Hour lines, there remains yet how to put on the Callender, to
graduate the Index, and to draw, and divide the line of Shadows.

This may be easily done from the Table R. Calculated, and accommodated to that
purpose for the year 1640, and may sufficiently serve for many years after,
without any sensible error.

Having divided the Quadrants, E.S. and E.N. (as before into the usual degrees
of a Quadrant,) lay a ruler upon the Center Z. and account the degrees from the
point E. in the Quadrant toward N. and S. out of the Table R. according to the
several Columes of the Table R. and Intersect the Quadrants, How to inscribe
the Callender
with small short lines, so shall the Arc of the Horizon of the Instrument
from E. be divided into the usual days of the Month, which is the Callender
and the beginning of these divisions, may be at the 10. of March, and so going
on to the 11. of June, and then again to begin from the 10. of March, and go
on unto the 10. of December, and these days may be noted upon the inside of
the Horizontall Arc with short lines from E. as before, and at every Month may
be placed a representative letter for that Month, and every 10. and 5. day of
every Month, may be noted with a small stroke somewhat longer then the rest,
to help the memory the readier to number. In like manner may the rest of the
days of the Calender be intersected in the out side of the Horizontall Arc,
toward the Limb, beginning at the 13. of September, and so going on to the
11. of June, then again from the 13. of September, and going on unto the 10.
of December, and these Months may be also noted with significant letters,
appropriate to each Month, and each 10. and 15. day of the Month, may be also
denoted as before, with a stroke somewhat longer than the rest, according to
the Scheme against Page the 1.

How to graduate the Index for the Instrument.
Let the Index be equal to the semidiameter, Z. E. and then may it be divided
out of the Table Q. by the help of the scale A. beginning at the Center: the
Index being divided, and placed on the Center of the Instrument at Z. it shall
help to put on, and divide the line of shadows. as follows.

Lay the edge of the Index to A. in the Limb which is near the 10. of
December, and move it to any degree in the Table S. and account the like degree
in the Index, and then make a mark upon the plain of the Instrument where
that degree touches, and so go on from point to point, until the whole line
be described and divided, according to the Table S. This line might be placed
between the Calender and the Limb, or in a Quadrant, etc. But I have caused
it to be described as is seen upon the Scheme against Page the 1. for
expedition and convenience.

Now if any desire mathematical diagram to enlarge the Instrument to a
proportion assigned, or to describe the Trapeziall form in the greatest
proportion upon a plain given: without curiosity, it may be done thus.

Let A. B. C. D. be a plain, divide the length A. B. within half an Inch of
the higher end, and an Inch of the lower end, in to 3. equal parts which
suppose the line M.N. then divide each part into half so the line M. N. shall
be divided into 6. equal parts, the middle of which will be at Z. Then take
4. of these parts for Radius, and on Z. describe the obscure Arc, A. E. B. and
upon Z. erect a perpendicular to the line M. N. to cut the Arc A. B. in E. now
from E. to A. protract 40. gr. and from E. to B. protract 50. gr. so the Angle
E. Z. M. shall be 90. and also A.Z.B. shall be 90. Now having made a scale of
Z.E. like to the scale A. according to the former directions) then out of the
Colume C. and by help of the said scale A. from Z. you may protract Z.. 2493.
Z.Q. 4823. and Z. 7673. and from the Colume F. y u may protract the distances
of the Centers of those intersections from Z. viz. Z. 1.5269. Z. 2.7949. and Z.
3.16217. and so placing the Compass in these Centers, you may describe the
Equator, and both Tropicks. But if Z. M, and Z. N. be divided according to the
scale A. then from Z. you may account the intersections of the parallels, and
distances of the Centers, and so describe the parallels with greater
expedition, and so shall you have the Scheme or Trapeziall form of the
Instrument, B. A... and may be finished according to that against Page the 1.
by the Tables and directions here calculated, and delivered to that end.

Now to augment the Instrument to any proportion assigned, as if between the
Tropickes were supposed to be 10. Inches, the Radius might be found out, or if
the Radius were 4. foot, (which is according to mine own Instrument:) what
distance might there be between the Tropickes: the proportion would be as
516. to 1000. so the breadth to the scale, or as 1000. to 516. so the scale to
the breadth: therefore by the Ring, bring 516. in the moveable, to 1000. in the
fixed, so right against any Radius in the fixed, is the distance between the
Tropickes in the Moveable, or against the distance assigned for the Tropickes
in the Moveable, is the measure of the Radius or Scale, in the fixed: So if..
be allotted to be 10. Inches, for the distance between the Tropickes, the
Scale, or Radius, of the Instrument should be 19 4/10. fere: but if the scale
or Radius were 4. foot, or 48. Inches, then the distance between the
Tropickes of, and. will be near 24 77/100. Inches. Thus for the making of the
Instrument, the description of which follows.

mathematical diagram

The Description of the Horizontall Quadrant.
THe form of this Instrument is like a mixed Trapezia, as appears against
Page. 1. where of two sides are right, and the other two sides are Circular,
which falls out to be so from the nature of the Projection, and that part
which I have thought most convenient for use, and is fully sufficient for that
which I have delivered upon it; and may be made of any plain Material, but
fittest in Brass, or Silver: the several parts of which Instrument are five,
viz. the Back, the Face, the Sights, the Index, and the divisions, and lines
projected on the Face.

First, the Back of the Instrument, is a part of Gemma projection, whose
particular description and admirable use I intend here after as God shall give
life and Ability to make manifest.

Secondly, the face of the Instrument, is that upon which Index, and sights are
placed on.

Thirdly, the Sights are the small pieces of Brass in Face of the Instrument;
one of which Sights is near the Center of the Instrument, and the other is
near the Circumference thereof.

Fourthly, the Index, is the movable piece of brass, Center, upon which also
two other sights may be placed, the edge of this Index is divided and noted
thus. 10. 20. 30. 40. 50. 60. 70. 80. 90. which are called the degrees of the
Index, and there is adjoined unto it three small plates to be rectified as
occasion requires, one of which is called the Axis, and the other two are
perpendiculars.

Fifthly, the lines described on the Face of the Quadrant are sixfold.

Viz. The Limb and its Parallels. The Calendar and its divisions. The Equator
and its Parallels. The Eclipticke and its divisions. The Hour lines and their
intermediates. The line of Shadows and its divisions.


First, the Limb is the outmost Circle, which is divided into 140. gr. and
noted at every 10. degree thus, 10. 20. 30. 40. 50. 60. 70. 80. 90. and each of
these degrees is divided into parts according to the Capacity of a degree in
the Instrument.

Secondly, the next parallel line to the Limb is the Horizon or Calendar,
which is noted with letters thus, I.A. S.O. N.D. I.F. M.A. M.I. of which I. in
the first place stands for July, A. for August, S. for September, O. for
October. etc. then again on the inside, I. stands for January, F. for
February, etc. each letter representing its Month, and each of those Months is
divided into days by small short lines, whereof the 10. and 15. day of every
Month is signified by Numbers, or else by a line somewhat longer then any of
the others, to help the memory the readier to Number, and for more promptness
of finding the day of the Month, in the Calendar as occasion requires.

Thirdly, The Equater is that line that meets with the tenth of March, and
the thirteenth of September in the Calendar, and is divided into degrees, and
numbered thus, 10. 20. 30. 40. 50. 60. 70. 80. 90. and the parallels to the
Equator are these lines which are on each side of it, every 5. degree of which
being noted thus, 5. 10. 15. 20. the outmost of those Parallels on each side of
the Equator are the two Tropickes that which is nearest the Center, is called
the Tropicke of, and that which is farthest of, is called the Tropicke of,
those two Tropicks, the Calendar, and the hour of 12. comprehend the whole
Projectin: and here note farther that these parallels are called parallels of
the day of the Month, as well as the parallels of the Suns Declination,
according as they shall be used, and farther below the Tropicke of Cancer is a
graduation of the common hours of a Horizontall Dyall: some use of whsch is
shown, by pro. 36.

Fourthly, the Eclipticke on the instrument is represented Eclipticke which
crosses the former parallels, and meets with the Equator, in the Horizon or
Calendar, in the former 10. of March, and 13. of September: that Quarter which
is toward the Center of the instrument, serves for the Northern semicircle of
the Eclipticke, and that which is farther from the Center serves for the
Southern semicircle of the Eclipticke; and each of these semicircles is
divided into the Signs of the Zodiac, and charactered accordingly
thus,............ Of which the first 6. Signs are called Northern signs and
are in the Northern semicircle, and the other 6. Southern signs and are in
the Southern Semicircle. And each of those signs is divided into 30. gr. and
if the Instrument be large, each of these degrees may be divided into 6. or 12.
divisions more, So every division shall accordingly contain 10. or 5. Minutes.

Fifthly, the hour lines are those that cross the Equator Tropicke of with
numerall Characters thus IIII. V. VI. VII. VIII. IX. X. XI. XII. And are the
forenoone hour notes: those hourelines serve also for the afternoon hours,
and are noted likewise with Arithmeticall figures, for the hours in the
afternoon thus, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. each of those hours is divided into
3. parts, each part being 20. minutes: and each of those parts is subdivided
again into 5. parts, so that each part contains 4. minutes, and so the whole
hour is diveded into 15. parts or degrees, each part or degree being 4. minutes
as before, and so the whole hour shall contain 60. minutes or parts: and here
note that these Hour circles with their intermediates are also called
Meridians or degrees of measure, and are Numbered by tens in the Equator, from
the meeting of the Equator with the Eclipticke, as before thus, 10. 20. 30.
40. 50. 60. 70. 80. 90.

Sixthly, the line of shadows is that which makes a sphaericall Equilaterall
Triangle upon the plain of the Instrument, the basis of which is the Horizon,
or Calendar and one of whose legs is below the Tropicke of and the other
crosses the Tropicke and parallels, and meets with the Calendar near in the
10. of December: both of those equal sides are called the line of shadows,
and are divided alike into 10. unequal divisions, and each of those divisions
again is divided into 10. other divisions, and again each of them into other
10. (if the Instrument be large.) The first Capital 10. divisions are noted
with Arithmeticall figures thus, 1. 2. 3. 4. 5. 6. 7. 8. 9. 10. of which 1. is
at the very meeting of the two lines, not far from the Center, which
signifies Equal: the figure of 2. Double: the figure of 3. Triple, the figure
of 4. Quadruple: the figure of 5. Quintuple, etc, Thus for the making, and
description of the Instrument, the use of it now follows.

Of the Uses of the Horizontall Quadrant, specified in the Index or Table,
formerly delivered.
OF which some have relation to the observation or appearance of the Sun,
others without observation, or sight of the Sun.

The Uses of these which are known without seeing the Sun, are 30. of the
said Index or Table, as follows, viz. the 2. 9. 10. 12. 13. 14. 15. 16. 17.
18. 19. 20. 21. 23. 24. 25. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. 32. 33. 35. 37. 38. 39. 40. 41.
and 42. of which 13. of them will be shown only by knowing the day of the
Month, viz. the 18. 33. 21. 19. 25. 24. 35. 2. 38. 37. 20. 41. and 42. as
follows.

The day of the Month known to find.
1. The hour of Sun rising, setting, and length of the day. 2. The Suns
difference of Ascension. 3. The Suns Declination. 4. What days are alike in
length, and what day the Sun rising in the one, shall be the Sun setting in
the other. 5. The Suns place, or degree in the Eclipticke. 6. The Suns
right Ascension, and oblique Ascension. 7. The hour, and Altitude of the
Suns coming East, or West. 8. The distance of the Suns rising, or setting,
from the East, or West. 9. The height, or depression of the Sun in the
Meridian here, or for any Latitude. 10. The time of day break, and end of
twylight. 11. The inequality of time, between day break, and Sun rising.
12. The hour, and Altitude of the Suns coming upon any declining wall. 13.
At what hour, and Altitude, the Sun must have to be opposite or perpendicular,
to a declining wall.
First, to find the time of Sun
Seek the day of the Month in the Calendar, hour line that meets therewith,
shows the time of Sun rising, or setting.

So if the day of the Month were the 13. October, the parallel that meets
therewith is the hour, viz. 7. of the clock, at which time the Sun rises:
the same hour is noted also with 5. which is ye time of Sun setting that day,
this doubled makes 10. the length of the day required.

Secondly, to find the difference
Mark what Meridian meets with the day Month in the Calendar: as suppose the
day to be the former 13. of October, which is the hour line of 7. and 5. (as
before) and account the Numbers of Meridians to the hour of 6. so have you 15.
gr. or an hour, which is the difference of Ascension for the 13. day of
October required.


Mark what parallel of Declination meets with the day of the Month in the
Calendar, and account how many degrees it is from the Equinoctial, so have you
the Suns Declination for that day.

August, the parallel that meets therewith is the 5th. from the Equator, and
so much is the Suns declination, that day, viz. 5. gr. North declination.


For the first, note that the days between the 10th of December and the 11th.
of June, are days of Increase, and the rest are days of Decrease. Now right
against any day of decrease in the Calendar, is the day of increase, which
days are equal one to the other. May, is against the 4. of July, at which
time the Sun rises and sets alike without sensible error, viz. 4. of the
clock, and therefore those days are of equal length, and so of others.

For the second, to find what day the sun rising in the one, shall be the
sun setting in the other.
Admit the day to be the 18th. of February and according to the first pro.
find the time of Sun rising, which is at 40. m. after 6. Month the hour
line of 20 m, after 5. in the forenoone, meets with the Calendar, which will
be the 23. of August, so the 18th. day of February the Sun did set at the same
hour that it did rise, the 23. day of August.

Fifthly, to find the suns place, or
Note where the parallel of the day of the Month crosses the Eclipticke, that
is the Suns October meets with the Eclipticke in the beginning of, and, but
which of these is the Suns place, the quarter of the year may easily tell
you, viz. which is the Suns place or the degree in the Eclipticke for that
day.


Consider what Meridean meets with the Suns place in the Eclipticke for the
day given, and mark the number of Meridians in the Equator (for the Meridians
are numbered in the Equator, as is said before in the description) so have you
the Suns right Ascension: but here note that the degrees in the Eclipticke
are numbered forward and backward in the Eclipticke unto 360. gr. upon this
Instrument: so are the right Ascentions of those degrees also numbered forward
and backward in the Equator: for the right ascension of any degree in the
Eclipticke, is that degree of the Equator which is opposite unto it, (the
succession of the signs considered) so if the Sun were in the beginning of,
the right Ascension is near 208. degrees, for the Meridian that passes by the
beginning of, is accounted in the Equator from, and is within 6. m, of 28. gr.
Now the right Ascension of, is 90. gr. and the beginning the of, is 180. gr.
and from the beginning of, to the beginning, is within 6. m, of 28. gr. as
before, all is which put together makes near 208. gr. the right Ascension of
the Sun the 13th. day of October.

To find the Suns Oblique Ascension at any time.
Note that the difference of Ascension, is the Ascension of the Sun, and the
oblique Ascension thereof: therefore the right Ascension known by the last
direction, and the difference of Ascension by the second direction, the oblique
Ascension is easily had, by Addition, or substraction thus. If the Sun be in a
Southern sign then the oblique Ascension, is greater then the right
Ascension, by so much as the difference of Ascension comes to: but if the Sun
be in a Northern sign, the oblique Ascension is so much less: which
difference of Ascension as before by the 2 Pro: for the said 13th. of October
was 15. gr. this ad unto the right Ascension of the beginning of, viz. 208. gr.
makes 223. gr. the Suns oblique Ascension for the beginning of, on the 13th.
day of October; but if the Sun had been in the beginning of, the oblique
ascension would have been only near 13. gr. viz. 12. gr. 54. m.

Seventhly, to find the suns Altitude,
Here note that this Proposition holds in use only for that time of the Suns
being in the Northern signs that is from the 10th. of March to the 13th. of
September: therefore lay the Index to the East, or Aequinoctiall point noted
with E. or 40. and 50. in the Limb: so have you instantly at once without
farther rectification both the Altitude and hour of the Suns coming East or
West, above the Horizon for all or any of the days above specified: so the
parallel of any day of the Month meeting with the edge of the Index gives the
Suns Altitude in the Index, and the Meridian meeting therewith shows the hour.

So if it were the second of May, or the 22. of July, the parallel belonging to
those days meets with the Index near about, 23. gr. 17. m, and there also
meets with that point, the hour line of 7, and 5. which shows that when the
Sun is 23. gr. 17. m, high either upon the second of May or the 22. of July;
then the Sun will be due East or West, and that will happen to be at 7 of the
clock in the forenoone, and 5. of the clock in the afternoon.


Lay the Index to the day of the Month, for the time given, and the edge of it
in the Limb of the Instrument shall show the Amplitude required.

So if the day were the 13th. October the number of degrees from the points of
East, noted with 40. 50. unto the Index is 18. gr. 40. m. which is the Suns
Amplitude for the given day, viz. the 13th. day of October.

Ninthly, to know the suns Meridionall
Lay the Index unto the hour of 12, and where Month meets yt therewith shall
be the Suns Meridionall Altitude.

So if it were the 13th. day of October, as before, Equator South: this
crosses the Index in 27. gr. which is the Suns Meridionall Altitude that
day. Now for the Suns depression at midnight, here is to be noted, that any
degree of the Eclipticke is at any time so much below the Horizon, as his
opposite degree in the Eclipticke, is above the Horizon at the same time.

Therefore where the contrary parallel of the Sun viz. 11. gr. and a half
North, meets with the Index in the hour of 12. that shall be the Suns
Meridionall depression at midnight, the said 13th. day of October.


This proposition, has reference to the Suns depression under the Horizon,
for it is said to be day break or twilight to end, when the Sun is, 18. gr.
under the Horizon: therefore the Construction in this will be thus.

Index then move the Index until that degree meet with the Contrary parallel
of Declination for the day given, so the Meridian or Houre-line that meets
therewith shall be the hour of day break required.

April, the parallel of Declination for that day is North II. gr. and a half
which I seek out one the other side of the Equator viz. II. gr. and a half
South Declination, and Mark where the 18th. gr. of the Index meets
therewith, for there also is the hour of day break viz. with in 20. m. of 3.
in the Morning, and 20. m. past 9. for the end of twilight the said 10th. of
April, also the Index in the Horizon at that Instant shows the position of
the Sun under the Horizon viz. near 48 gr. 10. m. to the North of the East:
but if the day had been the 13th of October the hour of daybreake had been 2
minutes before 5. and twilight would have ended 2. m. after 7.

Eleventhly, to find the inequallitie
By the first Construction, for the days given Sun rising, and by the former
13th Construction the hour and time of day break belonging to those days:
then compare the time between the Sun rising, and day break of the one, with
that of the other, so the difference of those two, shall be the difference of
time required.

H. M. H. M. So on the tenth of March the Sun rising is at 6. 00 The time
between day break and Sun rising is. 2. 0 the difference is, 12. m. day
break is at 4. 00 Docemb. the Sun rising it at 8. 12 2. 12 day break, is at
6. 00 the difference is. 1. ho. 22. m. May the Sun rising is at 4. 11 3. 34 day
break, at 12, 37

So the difference of time between day break and Sun rising the 10th of
December is near a quarter of an hour longer then that of the 10th of March;
but more then an hour and half longer between day break, and Sun rising the
10th of May, then the 10th of March.



Seeing the declinations of Plains, or Walls, are accounted from the points of
East or West in the Horizon, as the suns Amplitude is the numbering of them
therefore shall be alike, in the Limb of the Instrument. Now admit the
Declination of a Plain or Wall, to be 22. gr. the opperation Index being set
thereto, you may instantly see at what hour the Sun will come upon the
Plain, for any day in the year; for where the parallel of the day of the
Month crosses the Index amongst the hourelines, (which Index represents the
Plain) that is the hour of the Suns coming upon the Plain and the degrees
in the Index gives the Suns Altitude. Tropicke of the Tropicke meets with
the Index almost within 5 m. of 9 in the Morning, and at that time the Sun
comes upon the Plain, and there the Tropicke cuts also the Index in 45. gr.
40. m. which is the suns Altitude at that time that ye Sun will glance or begin
to shine upon the Plain.

As for the time of the suns continuance on the Plain (as is specified in the
Index or Table) account the Declination, on the other side of the East point,
and lay the Index thereto, so the edge of it in the Tropicke of, will point out
at what hour the Sun goes of the Plain viz. at 6. of the clock and 38. m,
near, if the declination were West, (as here it is supposed) which added to
the time of the suns coming on the Plain, makes 9. hours 33. m, and so long
the sun shines on the Plain.

Thirteenthly, to find at what
Let a Plain decline from the East point toward the South 22. Limb hour of
12. and lay the Index thereto, so the parallel that crosses the Index, does
show the Suns Altitude, and the Meridian meeting therewith, gives the hour,
at which time the Sun will be opposite to the Plain; so have you at one
instant for every day in the year, at what hour and Altitude, the Sun will
be opposite to the Plain.

gr. m. As admit the days were these. December. the tenth, the Suns place at
which time is in and the hour of the Suns being opposite to the plain, that
day would be at 40-m past. 1 and the Suns Altitude at that time would be, 12.12
March. 14 m. past. 1. 36.25 June 48 m. past 12 60.45

Thus touching the resolution of the former 13 uses of the aforesaid Table, or
Index which had reference only to the knowledge of the day of the Month, there
are 13. other uses of the foresaid Index, or Table viz. the 10. 12. 32. 39. 40.
23. 17. 16. 26. 27. 28. 29. 30. Which have no dependence upon the sight of the
Sun, of which the 6 first are resolved, only by knowing the day of the Month,
and the other 7. are as follows.

viz by knowing the day of the Month to find.
1. At what hour the shadow of an Altitude is equal, double, triple, etc.
unto it. 2. At any hour and Altitude of the Sun, or Azimuth, what proportion
shadows have to their bodies. 3. The hour of the day agreeable to any
Altitude, or Azimuth. 4. The Suns depression and Azimuth at any hour of the
night Assigned. 5. The hour of the day to our Antipodes, by suposing the Suns
Depression under the Horizon. 6. At what hour in any day the Suns Azimuth and
Altitude will be equal, and how much the Altitude and Azimuth will be.
To find.
7. What number of days will make the day an hour longer, or shorter at any
time. 8. The inequallitie of time in equal months, or equal number of days.
9. The degree of the Equator in the Horizon, by supposing any degree of the
Eclipticke in the Horizon. 10. The degree of the Eclipticke in the Horizon by
supposing the degree of the Equator in the Horizon. 11. The degree of Medium
Coeli, or the degree of the Eclipticke in the Meridian, by supposing the degree
of the Eclipticke in the Horizon, vel contra. 12. The Horoscope, or the degree
ascendant, or descend^nt, and the Nonagessima degree at any hour. 13. What
Angle the Eclipticke makes with the Horizon, or the Altitude of the Nonagessima
degree, and what Azimuth it is in at any hour.
First, to find the Proportion of
As if it were required the 20 of April, Sun must be either in the forenoone
or afternoon, that the shadow of a man or any Altitude, shall be equal unto
his height double, triple, quadruple Quintuple etc.

Lay the Index unto the numbers in the line of shadows viz. to 1. 2. 3. 4. 5.
etc. and wheresoever any of those divisions in the line of shadows meet with
the Index amongst the degrees; there it shows what height the Sun must have,
to make the shadows equal, double, triple etc. to the Altitude. Index upon 1
in the line of shadows, it meets with 45. gr. in the Index: and so high the
Sun must be to make the shadow of a man or any thing equal to his height upon
an Horizontall plain: then move the Index to and fro, until the said 45. gr.
in the Index meet with the parallel of the day Month, viz the 20. of April, so
the hour line that meets therewith, is the hour of the day that the shadow
of a Man: or other Altitudes, will be equal to his height or Altitude, viz
near 10. of the Clock in the forenoone, or 2. of the Clock, in the
afternoon.

forenoone. afternoon. gr. m. ho. m. ho. m. And according to the same
directions when shadows are Double. The Altitude would be. 26. 33 and the hour
the said 20. of April would be, 7. 37 4. 23 Triple. 18. 26 6. 43 5. 17
Quadruple. 14. 2 6. 16 5. 44 Quintuple. 11. 19 5. 58 6. 02 Sextuple. 9. 27 5.

5. 25 6. 35 Decuple. 5. 43 5. 21 6. 39 Vigecuple. 2. 51 5. 2 6. 58

Secondly, to find what proportion
If the hour be known, or supposed, move the Index until it meet with the
hour in the parallel of the day of the Month, so the intersection of that
parallel with the Index is the suns Altitude, and the edge of the Index, in the
Limb, will show the Suns Azimuth, then move the Index until the degree of
Altitude intersect the line of shadows, so shall you have the proportion of
shadows, to their bodies required.

So if on the 11th. of April at, 7. Clock in the forenoone, (if the Sun
shine,) it were required what proportion the shadow of a man shall bear to his
height, or the shadow of an Altitude to the Altitude, the parallel that
belongs to the given day is near 12. gr. Mark where this parallel meets
with the given hour of 7. and bring the Index to it; so have you the Suns
height at that hour viz 18. gr. 26. m, and the edge of the Index in the Limb
of the Instrument, shall give the Azimuth viz 4. gr. from the East: then move
the Index, until the degree of the Suns Altitude viz 18. gr. 26. m, meet with
the line of shadows which will be in 3, which shows that at 7. of the Clock
in the forenone the said 11th. of April, the shadow of a man, or the shadow of
an Altitude, shall be Triple to his height: the like will be at 5. of the
Clock in the afternoon, for equal distances of the Sun from the Meridian the
same day, without sensible error, will give equal Altitudes of the sun, and
equal Altitude of the sun does produce equal shadows upon Horizontall Plains

Secondly, if the Position or Azimuth of the Sun be known or supposed, which
admit 4 gr. from the East toward the South.

Lay the Index unto it in the limb, and mark what degree in the Index the
parallel meets with, which is with 18. gr. 26. m, so have you the suns
Altitude in the Index: then move the Index until ye degree meet with the Line
of shadows; so have you the proportion of shadows required at that instant,
viz Triple as before.

Thirdly, if the Suns height be known or supposed, which admit 18. gr. 26. m,
account it in the Index, and moove the Index until that degree meet with the
line of shadows; so where it intersecteth the line of the shadows, there you
have the proportion of shadows to their bodies at that instant of time
required, which will be triple as before; so the 10th. of April if the hour
be 7. or the Altitude 18. g. 26. m, or the Azimuth 4. gr. from the East toward
the South, the proportion of shadows to their bodies will be Triple.

Thirdly to find the hour of the
For the first account the Suns Altitude in the Index, and move it to and fro
until that degree meet with the parallel of the day of the Month: so the
Meridian that passes by that point, shall be the hour required.

Thus if the day were the tenth of March, Sun being that day in the
Aequinoctial, and the Altitude supposed to be 32. gr. 37. m, this I seek out
upon the Index and move the Index till that degree meet with the Equator; so
the Meridian or hour Circle that passes thereby is the hour viz. 10. of the
Clock in the forenoone or 2. of the Clock in the afternoon, and if you move
the Index softly along as the degrees of the Suns Altitude in the Index
intersect the Equator (and so of any parallel:) so the Meridian that meets
therewith is the hour of the day agreeable to that Altitude.

For the second, to find the hour
As suppose it were 36. gr. 35. m, South. Move the Index in the Limb unto this
Azimuth known or supposed; so where the Index crosses the parallel for the day
given, there the Meridian that meets therewith, shows the hour of the day
viz 10. of the Clock in the forenoone or 2 in the afternoon as before. And if
you move the Index softly along, as the Index passes by any Azimuth in the
Limb: so the edge of the Index shall intersect the parallel of declination for
the day of the Month, in the hour of the day agreeable to that Azimuth: by
which proposition and the last, Glasses may be easily placed to burn according
to the Suns Azimuth, or hour assigned.


By the 11th Construction it is said that any degree of the Eclipticke, is
as much below the Horizon at any time, as his opposite degree is above the
Horizon at the same time: therefore if the Index be laid to the like parallel,
on the contrary side of the Equator, that meets with the given hour the
intersection in the Index shall show you the degree of the Suns depression
under the Horizon at that hour.

So if at 10 of the Clock at night the said 13th of October it were required
to find the Suns depression under the Horizon, declination, or the suns
parallel for that day, which is 11. gr. and a half South, which declination I
seek in the other side of the Equator, and mark where it meets with the
hour of 10. unto which I lay the Index, so the edge thereof in the Limb
shows the suns Azimuth to be nere 42 gr. 30. m, from the South, and the
parallels intersection that meets with the Index, gives the Suns depression,
viz. near 43. gr. and so much is the Sun below the Horizon, and in that
position the 13th of October at 10. of the Clock at night.

But if it were required at what hour of the Night the Sun would touch the
vertical Circle of East and West under the Horizon.

Lay the Index to the point of East and mark Index, for there you have both
the hour and the degree of the suns depression.

So the day being as before the 13th of October, declination south 11. gr. and
a half, this account among^^ the North declinations and it meets with the
Index in 38 m, past 6. the hour of the Suns being West, and with all the suns
depression, at the same time is near 14. gr. and 50. m.


Consider the declination for the day, and move the Index to and fro until the
degree of the suns depression in the Index, meets with the like parallel or
the other side of the Equator, so the hour that meets therewith is the hour
of the day to our Antipodes.

So if on the 20th. of April, we should suppose the sun to be 13. gr. under
the Horizon, and desire to know the hour to our Antipodes, the parallel of
declention for that day is 15. gr. North, Now in the Index account 13. degrees
and move it to and fro until the said thirteenth degree in the Index meet
with the 15th. parallel of South declination, so the Meridian that meets
therewith is the hour of the day to our Antipodes, within 2 m, of 9. at night.


Move the Index, to and fro until the edge of the Index meet with the
parallel belonging to that day, in the same Number of degrees that the end of
the Index in the Limb from the point of East does; so have you the degree of
the Suns Azimuth, and Altitude equal the one to the other, and the Meridian
meeting with the Index in the parallel of the given day, shows at what hour
that Azimuth, and Altitude will be equal.

So admit the sun to be in the Tropicke of, Index being moved to and fro until
there be like degrees in the Index, and in the Limb, which will be near 16.
gr. 45. m, and there the hour that meets therewith is 12. m, after 6. in the
forenoon, at which hour the eleventh of June, the Suns Azimuth, and Altitude,
will be equal viz. near 16. gr. 45. m, as before.

Seventhly, to find what number
Account 7. gr. and a half amongst the Meridians Kallender, and note the day
of the Month against it, then number the days between that day and the given
day, and you have the answer.

So if the day were the last of February, March, consider the Suns setting that
day by the Instrument, which is 40. m, past 5. this doubled makes the length of
the day, 11. hours 20. m, then from the last of February account 7. gr. and a
half and it will point out the fifteenth of March at which time the Sun seteth
at 10. m, past 6 which doubled makes 12 hours 20. m, so the fifteenth of
March, the length of the day is an hour longer then it was the first of March;
and the difference of time only but 15. days, but if the number of days were
accounted to or from the Suns entering into the Tropicall points, it will be
more then 35. days before the day will be an hour longer or shorter.

So if from the tenth of June we should account 7. gr. and a half amongst the
Meridians from that Meridian that meets with the tenth of June, it would fall
out at the 16th. day of July, at which time the day will be an hour shorter
then it was the tenth of June, and the intervall of time more then twice as
much as the former viz. 39. days.


This proposition at the first seems as a Paradox, yet by this Instrument may
easily be resolved, and so consequently from Mathematical principles
demonstrated, not only the inequality of equal Months, but also the
inequality of Natural days.

Now a day natural according to the general definition is one revolution of
the Equator or primum mobile, that is from sun rising to sun rising: or it is
the time wherein the sun passes by the Meridian, and comes to the Meridian
again, commonly taken for 24. hours: but be cause that in that intervale of
time the sun passing from the Meridian and comes to the Meridian again, the
Sun moves according to his Natural motion (secundum antiquiorum traditionem)
near a degree more or less; therefore the Natural day shall be some what
longer or shorter then 24. hours, viz. by so much as the difference of right
ascension of that degree of the Eclipticke comes to that the sun is in, and
seeing the degrees of the Eclipticke amongst themselves have not the same
difference of right Ascension that the other degrees have, (notwithstanding the
degrees of the Eclipticke amongst themselves being equal the one to the other)
the suns motion ender those degrees being sometimes quicker, and sometimes
slower, it will necessarily follow that the sun will move more or less until
the sun can touch the Meridian, which is the limit or term of the suns
diurnall revolution as before: this difference and inequality of time in
natural days may by calculation be given from day to day, but because it is
so insensible little in a day, hardly by an Instrument of this nature can be
seen, but by a number of days, compared with another number of days it will
evidently appear.

So, Month of December is longer then the Month of March, in the first of which
months the suns motion is quicker, being about the Perigeum then at other
months have equal number of days, viz. 31.

Find the right ascension for the beginning and ending of Mar. viz. 350.0. the
difer. of right ascension for the Month of Mar. is 29.30. the difference
between these is 5. gr. 19. 30. beginning and ending of Dece. viz. 257. the
difer. of right ascension for the Month of Dece. is 34. 30. 292.. which 5. gr.
being converted into time by allowing 4 minits to a degree makes about 20. m,
and so much is the Month of December longer then the Month of March,
notwithstanding both of these Months containing equal number of days.


If the degree given be in the Northern part of the Ecliptike, the oblique
Ascension is less then the Ascension vel contra. Get therefore first the right
Ascension of the point given by the sixth Pro. and the difference of Ascension
by the 2. Pro. for that taken from the right Ascension gives the degree of the
Aequinoctiall in the Horizon, but if the given degree had been in a Southren
sign, the difference of Ascension must be added to the right Ascension, so
have you the degree of the Equator in the Horizon.

Tenthly, to find the degree of
This is but the Converse of the former, only Aequinoctiall to these of the
Eclipticke.

Eleventhly, to find the degree of
Seek the degree of the Equator in the Horizon, by the 22. Pro. subtract, 90.
from it (if the Number be too little add a whole Circle to it) then the degree
of the Eclipticke opposite to the remainder, is the Answer, but note that if
the remainder be between 270. and 360. the opposite point belongs to the last
Quarter of the Ecliptike, if the remainder be between 180. and 270. then it
respects the 3 quarter of the Eclipticke, if the remainder be between 90. and
180. it has reference to the second Quarter. etc.

But if the degree of the Eclipticke in the Horizon were required by knowing
the degree of the in Eclipticke the Meridian.
This, is only but the converse of the former, and Ascentio^ of the given
degree of Medium Coeli, and add thereto 90. gr. by accounting it from the
former right Ascension, and note the suns place opposite thereto for the
difference of Ascension of this last degree being subtracted from the former
degree of the Equator in the Horizon, if it be a degree of the Southren signs
(otherwise Add) gives the degree of the Eclipticke in the Horizon demanded.

Twelfthly, to find the Horoscope
First, note the right Ascension for the day given Equator in the Meridian, at
12. of the Clock, unto which degree add 90. so have you the degree of the
Equator in the Horizon at 12. of the Clock. Then consider how many hours the
given hours wants of 12. or is past 12. which converted into measure and
accounted Eastward, or Westward, according to the hour given from the former
points of the Equator in the Horizon at 12. will give the degree of the
Equator in the Horizon at the hour proposed, then by the 23. Pro. I seek out
the degree of the Eclipticke in the Horizo^ answerable to the degree of the
Equator so have you the degree Ascendant, from which account 90. gr. or 3
signs, so have you the degree of the Nonagessima point in the Horizon, but if
you reckon 6. signs from the Ascendant, you have the desendant degree of the
Eclipticke in the West of the Horizon.


According to the last Pro. sinde the degree Ascendant, and the Nonagessima
degree, then by the 24. Pro. find what degree of the Eclipticke is in the
Meridian, Answerable to the degree of the Eclipticke in the Horizon, so shall
you know on which side of the Meridian the Nonagessima degree is, and how far
from the Meridian, then if yt Index be laid upon the hour of 12, where the
parallel of the Nonagessima degree crosses it, that should be the height of
it, if it were in the Meridian; account therefore from the Meridian or hour of
12. in the Equator, the number of degrees between the Nonagessima degree, and
the degree of the Eclipticke in the Meridian, and mark where that Meridian
meets with the parallel of the of the Nonagessima degree, lay the Index
thereto, so have you the Altitude of the Nonagessima degree in the Index, and
the Azimuth in the Horizon, or Limb of the Instrument.

There are yet the 48. 49. 50. 9. 13. 14. and 15th. uses of the said Index or
Table, which have no relation to the suns sight or observation in there
operation, and resolutions, and should have followed these 26. uses that have
been delivered: but I refer them to the end of this Tractat; as for these
uses of the Instrument which depend upon the Suns sight, or observation they
are these 13. following viz. the 1. 31. 4. 6. 36. 7. 22. 3. 5. 34. 11. 43. and
8th.

viz. to show
1. The Sun, or stars Altitude above the Horizon at any time. 2. The hour of
the day, and Azimuth of the sun. 3. The Meridian Line upon any appearance of
the Sun. 4. The sit of a building, or costing of a place. 5. The Suns Azimuth,
and hour without Observation. 6. The variation of the Needle. 7. The Latitude
of a place, or height of the Pole above the Horizon. 8. The Suns Azimuth, and
Altitude at any hour. 9. The uncertainty of time, by noting the shadow of
things. 10. The Quarter of the year and day of the Month, with the hour,
Azimuth, and the Meridian line. 11. Instantly the hour of the day, the
Azimuth, and Altitude of the Sun: with the Meridionall line, without
observation or sight of the Sun, by knowing the Proportion between the length
of a shadow upon a Horizontal Plain, and that which did cast the shadow. 12.
The Declination of a Wall, by seeing the Sun beginning to shine thereon or
going from it. 13. The Declination of a Wall, the Sun shining thereon.
First, how to observe the Sun, or
Lift up the edge of the Instrument to the eye, Limb or Circumference of the
Quadrant be next the eye, and the Index to hang perpendicular and to play
easily by the side thereof: then move the Quadrant up and down until you may
through both sights see the Center or middle of the Sun, or star: so the Index
in the Limb shall fall upon the degrees of the Sun or stars Altitude above
the Horizon at that time. Or without looking at the sun, the Altitude thereof
may be thus found: hold the Quadrant Index may hang perpe^dicular, or be
vertical as before, then move about the Instrument until the edge of it be
opposite to the body of the Sun. Now supposing the Instrument to hang thus upon
his Center, softly lift up the edge thereof which is toward the Sun, until
you see the beams of the sun pass through both sights, then the Index in the
Limb shall give the suns Altitude as before.


By the last Pro. observe or take the suns Altitude and account it on the
Index, then seek for the parallel of the day of the Month for the day present,
and move the Index until that degree of Altitude in the edge of the Index
meet with the parallel of the day, so the Meridian that meets with that
degree of Altitude in the Index, shall be the hour of the day required, and
the edge of ye Index in the Limb of the Instrument, shall likewise show the
Suns Azimuth belonging to that hour.

So if upon the last of August the Suns Altitude in the forenoone should be
observed and found to be 30. Altitude out upon the Index and move the Index
until the degree of Altitude meet with the parallel for the day of the Month
given, viz. the fifth parallel from the Equator Northward so the houreline that
meets also with the 30. gr. and a half in the Index, is the hour viz. near
9. and that shall be the hour of the day at that instant, and the edge of the
Index in the Limb cutteth near 35. gr. and 30. m, from the point of East,
toward the South, and so much is the Suns Azimuth at that time.

Thirdly, how to find the Meridian
According to the 27. Pro. first observe the Suns Altitude above the Horizon,
and by the last Construction find the Suns Azimuth agreeable to that Altitude:
let the Index and rest at that degree, and erect the prependicular at the end
of the Index, then houlding the plain or face of the Quadrant parallel to the
Horizon, move the Instrument Circular, until the shadow of the said
perpendicular fall by the side of the Index, and so the houerline of 12, or the
edge of the Instrument which is parallel unto it (which is the North and south
edge of the Instrument) shall represent the Meridian line, and points out the
North and South in the Horizon of the world by the terms thereof, and the
other straight edge of the Instrument which is perpendicular unto that edge is
the ( East and West edge of the Instrument) and denotes or shows the line of
East, and West in the Horizon, of the world. But this may be more accurately
done if you place the back of the Instrument down upon an Horizontall plain,
and the edge of the Index being at the degree of the suns Azimuth observed, and
the perpendicular erected at the end of the Index as before: then moving the
Instrument as it so lies until the shadow of the perpendicular fall by the
side of the Index, so the Meridian of the Instrument, shall be in the Meridian
of the World, and every point and degree in the Limb of the Instrument shall
point out, and be opposite, and represent his like degree in the Horizon of the
world.

Construction serves only but for the forenoone observation; for if the
practice be in the afternone, the way to find the Meridian line may be thus.
Having found the suns Azimuth as before, lay the Index upon the hour line of
12. and erect the perpendicular at the end thereof, and move the Instrument
about Circular, until the shadow of the said perpendicular fall by the side of
the Index: for then if the edge of the Index be moved unto the suns Azimuth
before known, the edge of the Index shall represent the Meridian line, and 90.
gr. farther shall be the point of East, and the Center of the Instrument the
point of West, therefore if upon the plain that the Instrument lies upon, you
make a mark at the edge of the Index which is in the Meridian as before, and
another mark right under the Center and so place the North and South edge of
the Instrument unto these two points: then every degree in the Horizon. or
Limb of the Instrument, shall point out as before his opposite or ^ike degree
in the Horizon of the world.

Fourthly, how to find the sit
By the last Pro. find out or draw the Meridian and place the North and South
edge of the Instrument unto it: if the Building or Place ly in the Eastern
semicircle of the world (but if it ly in the Western semicircle, then let the
East and West edge of the Instrument be placed upon the Meridian line) so the
eye being over the Center of the Instrument, and behoulding the place, let the
Index be moved until it be also with the visual line observed by the eye, that
is opposite to the place, so the edge of the Index, from the Cardinal points
of the Instrument in the Limb, viz. from the East or West, North or South,
shall show the bearing of that place from you, in respect of the Cardinal
points of the world in the Horizon: but if two sights be placed at the Index
(which is according to the description thereof) then may you observe the place
through the sights of the Index by leting the Instrument rest, and moving the
Index to and fro until you see the object, so the edge of the Index in the
limb, shall point out the bearing or Position of the place from you in degrees
from the East, West, North, or South, and accounting 11. gr. and as often as
you can in those degrees, observed: you have the point of the Compass which
the place, or object bears from you.


The Meridian line being drawn first upon a North, and South edge of the
Instrument be placed unto the Meridian line, but if it be in the afternoon,
then set the edge of East, and West of the Instrument, unto the Meridian line,
and let the Instrument rest there, then erect the perpendicular at the end of
the Index, and move the Index about until the shadow of the perpendicular fall
by the side of the Index, so the edge of the Index will amongst the degrees in
the Limb show the Suns Azimuth at that time, and where the edge of the Index
meets with the parallel of the day of the Month, that is the hour of the day
at that time. But if the Axis be rectified then there is no need of a Meridian
line to be drawn, for this Instrument will with great facility find out his
own Meridian, by moving it to and fro until the shadow of the perpendicular
which is over the Center of the Instrument, intersect the same hour in the
Parallel of the day of the Month, that the Axis does amongst the Common
hours* so that hour shall be the hour of the day for that instant, and the
shadow of the said perpendicular, cutting the Limb, or extended unto it, does
there show the Suns Azimuth, and so the Meridian of the Instrument at that
position, shall be in the Meridian of the world required.

Sixthly, to find the variation
By the twenty nineth Pro. upon an even Plain parallel to the Horizon draw
the Meridian line, and North and South line of the Card directly over the said
Meridian line, so the Number of degrees that the Needle cutteth in the Card
from the North and South line of the Card, that shall be the variation of the
Needle required; otherwise it may be found thus: Near unto the Center of the
Index, upon the Index may a small Brosse pin be so placed that it may be
erected perpendicular to the Center of the Instrument and half an inch above
it. Let a Needle by placed upon this pin, then lay the East, and West edge of
the Instrument to the Meridian line, and when the Needle rests, move the
Index, until the edge of it be directly under the Needle so the edge of the
Index; in the Limb of the Instrument, shall point out or show the Needles
variation required.


First, draw the Meridian line upon some plain by help of the 38.
Construction, then erect the prependicular at the end of the Index, and place
the North and South edge of the Instrument, to the Meridian line so drawn upon
the plain, and move also the Index until the edge thereof touch the hour of
12. let the Instrument rest at this position, then mark diligently about noone
or 12. of the Clock when the shadow of the perpendicular does fall by the edge
of the Index, for then the sun is in the Meridian, at which time according to
the 27. Pro. observe or take the suns height (which is his Meridian Altitude,
for that day) and by the 3. Pro. find the Suns declination agreeable to that
day, and add it to the Suns Meridionall Altitude observe (if it be South
declination, otherwise subtract it from the former Meridionall Altitude,) so
have you the height of the Aequinoctial above the Horizon, that taken from 90.
gives the depression of the South Pole under the Horizon, which is always
equal to the elevation of the North Pole above the Horizon.

So if upon the tenth of April, Meridian Altitude should be found to be 50.
gr. the Declination belonging to that day by the 3. Pro. is 11. gr. and a half
North, which being subtracted (according to the former directions) leaves 38.
gr. 30. m, the height of the Aequinoctiall above the Horizon: and that taken
from 90. leaves 51. gr. 30. m the depression of the South Pole under the
Horizon: or the elevation of the North Pole above the Horizon, for the height
of the Aequinoctiall known, the Complement thereof is always the Latitude of
the place, or height of the Pole: and here note generally that the height of
the Pole and Aequinoctiall together, do always make a Quadrant or 90. gr.
therefore the height of one of them being known, the height of the other is
also known, and further here note that if the sun have North Declination, the
sun is so much higher then the Aequinoctiall at none that day, by so much as
his Declination, comes to, but if the Sun have South Declination, then the Sun
is lower then the Aequinoctiall that day at noone, by so much as his
Declination comes to, by which you may easily gether when to add, or subtract
the suns Declination to, or from the suns Meridianall Altitude to get the
height of Equator, which known the Poles height cannot be unknown.


Mark where the parallel for the day of the Month meets with the given
hour, and bring the edge of the Index thereto, so the degree that the edge of
the Index cutteth in the Limb of the Instrument that shall be the Suns Azimuth,
and the degree that the hour cutteth in the Index, that shall be the Suns
Altitude required.

So, if upon the tenth of December at nine of the Clock in the Morning, Suns
Azimuth and Altitude were required, mark first where the Tropic of Capricorn
(which is the parallel, for that day given) meets with the given hour of
nine, and bring the Index thereto, so the edge of it in the Limb points out
near 40. gr. and a half, and so much is the Suns Azimuth, from the South, at
nine of the Clock in the forenoone, the said tenth of December, and the hour
line meeting with the Index, shows near 5. gr. 25. m. so much is the suns
Altitude at that time; now if you move the Index softly along, as the edge of
it passes by any hour for any day of the year, so the edge of the Index in
the Limb of the Instrument shows the suns Azimuth, and the intersection of
the parallel with the Index shall show the Suns Altitude belonging to that
hour.

Ninthly, to show the uncertaintie
It is usually noted by some, that when the shadow of the edge of a Window,
Door, Wall, or such like, shall touch such or such marks, that it shall be
then such, or such an hour of the day, and so constantly to hold for all the
year, this observation is far from truth, and the principalls of Astronomy
(and may be easily contradicted by such which have but indifferent judgment in
the Nature of shadows, and the Suns passages by the Meridians and vertical
Circles of the Heavens, for by how much greater the propinquitie of the Suns
approchment is unto the Zenith, or vertical point, by so much the more shall
the hour or time be various in one and the same Azimuth.

So in the last Pro. the Azimuth of the Sun the tenth of December, at nine of
the Clock in the forenoone, was found to be 40. gr. and a half, Suns distance
from the Zenith, at that time was near 84. gr. 35. m, Now admit the Suns
distance from the Zenith the tenth of June were but 32. gr. 35. m, the Sun
being in the same Azimuth, the hour would be half an hour past 10. For the
Index being laid to the hour of 9. in the Tropicke of. (which is the Suns
parallel, for the said tenth of December,) and it cutteth the Suns Motion in
the inequality of time, and so the complement of the former 32. gr 35. m, in
the Index, meets with the Tropicke of, (which is the Suns parallel for the
tenth of June) in half an hour past 10. so that it evidently appears, that
the shadow of a perpendicular thing on the tenth of December, denoting the
hour of the day to be 9. of the Clock, the same shadow the tenth of June,
shall represent half an hour past 10. so the error shall be an hour and a
half: but if you move the Index unto the hour of 9. belonging to the tenth of
June, the Index shall point you out in the Limb near 68. gr. of Azimuth for
that hour, which at 9. of the Clock the tenth of December, was but 40. gr.
and an half, so the difference of Azimuth in one and the same hour, shall be
27. gr. and a half, and the time as before, an hour and a half: which
differences are sufficient to confirm the point.

Tenthly, to find the Quarter of
At any appearance of the Sun by the 27. Pro. take the Suns Altitude, then
place the North and South edge of the Instrument unto the Meridian line
formerly, drawn (if in the forenoone) otherwise place the East, and West, edge
of Instrument to the Meridian-line, and erect the prependicular at the end of
the Index, then moove the Index to and fro until the shadow of the
prependicular fall by the side of the Index, so the parallel that meets with
the degree of the Suns observed Altitude, in the edge of the Index, parallel in
the Calendar that shall show the day of the Month required.

So if, suns Altitude were observed and found to be 36. gr. having placed the
edge of the Instrument to the Meridian line, and rectified the Index, then move
the Index, until the shadow of the prependicular fall by the edge of the
Instrument, let the Instrument rest at this position, and account the former
36. gr. upon the Index, which degree meets with the hour in the Equator,
and also that intersecteth the Calendar, in the tenth of March, and the
thirteenth of September, but which of these days is the day of the Month, the
next days observation of the Sun upon the same hour will help you, for if
the suns Altitude besound to be greater then the day of the month inquired
after it was the tenth of ( March, because the sun from the tenth of December
unto the eleventh of June, does every day at one and the same hour, ascend,)
but if the Suns Altitude be found to be less then the former days observation
specified was, then the day required, was the thirteenth of September, because
that from the eleventh of June, unto the tenth of December, the suns Altitude
every day does sensibly diminish at one and the same hour.


But here is to be noted that if there be no Meridionall line, then the
prependicular over the Axis of the Index being erected, place down the back
of the Instrument upon an Horizontall plain, and move the Instrument to and
fro, until the shadow of the Axis meet with the same hour below the
Tropicke, amongst the common hours, that the shadow of the prependicular over
the Center of the Instrument meets with on the face of the Instrument, for
then the parallel that crosses or meets with the shadow of the
prependicular, and the hour, will in the Calendar show the day of the Month
required, and so then the Meridian of the Instrument shall be in the Meridian
of the world, and every point or degree in the Horizon of the Instrument, it
shall point out his like, or opposite degree in the Horizon of the world.

Altitude, then immediately by some Watch, clock, or Sun-dyall, learn the hour
of the day, and move the Index to and fro, until the Suns Altitude in the
Index, meet with the former hour, so the parallel that meets therewith,
shall show the day of the Month in the Calendar required, then having the day
of the Month, you have the Quarter of the year, for from the tenth of March
unto the eleventh of June, is the Spring quarter, from the eleventh of June, to
the thirteenth of September, is the Summer quarter, from the thirteenth of
September, to the tenth of December is the Autummuall quarter, and from the
tenth of December, unto the tenth of March, is the Winter Quarter.

Eleuenthly, to find the hour of
First, let the thing that casts the shadow, or scale,) then measure the
shadow with the scale, and mark how often the shadow is longer then the scale,
and the Decimall part if there be any, so have you the proportion between the
shadow, and that which did cast the shadow, and then is it resolved accor- to
the converse of the fifteenth Pro.,

mathematical diagram

February, or on the ninth of October, houlding a staff prependicular as A B,
or supposing it to be part of the Coin of a House, or edge of a Window or such
like should cast a shadow, as B, C, which being noted, or drawn and having
divided the staff, or thing as before, and should then measure the shadow, as
B, C, by the said staff or scale, and find it to be contained therein three
times, and 6, parts or 6, decimals, the porportion of the Gnomon, or scale, A
B, to the shadow B C, would be as 1 to 3. and 6/10.

Index to and fro, until the edge of it mere with 3. and 6/10, in the line of
shadows; so have you the degree of the Suns Altitude at that instant in the
Index, viz. 15. gr. and then seek out the parallel for the 12. of February, or
the ninth of October (the day given) which is near the tenth degree from the
Equator South, move the Index, until the former 15. gr. and in the Index,
meets with the said parallel for the day, so have you the hour belonging to
that time, which will be near 42 m, past 8. in the Morning, or 18. m, past 3
in the after noone, and the edge of the Index in the Limb of the Instrument
shows the suns Azimuth also at that instant, viz, near 39. gr. 12. m, from
the East toward the South.

Now for the Meridionall line, this may be done Azimuth be not forgotten: for
if the Center of the Instrument be laid down upon any part of the shadow B C,
and so the Instrument to be moved upon his Center until the said shadow B C,
formerly drawn, cut the edge of the Limb, in the aforesaid Azimuth of 39. gr.
30. m, then the Meridian of the Instrument shall be in the Meridian of the
world, and if that shadow were from a Window, or Building, the position of the
Instrument, shall denote the position of the Window or Building.

Twelfthly, to find the Declination
By the 27. Pro. take the height of the Sun, and Pro. find the Suns Azimuth
for the Altitude, so the Azimuth thus found shall be the declination of the
Plain required: for the declination of any perpendicular Plain, is accounted
from the points of East, West, North or South, in the Horizon, as the Suns
Azimuth is: therefore whatsoever Plain is in the plain of any virticall
Circle, that Plain is as far from any of the Cardinal points of the Horizon,
as the sun is at that time, and so the Sun, being in that virticall Circle,
shall necessarily glance upon the Plain: and therefore look what the Suns
Azimuth is at that instant, such shall be the Declination of the Plain
required.

Thirteenthly, to find the Declination
By the 28. Pro. find the Suns Azimuth, and North and South edge of the
Instrument to the Plain, which admit Z, but the Plain to be represented by
the line, M N, then let the Azimuth of the Sun be accounted from the point of
East, in the Limb of the Instrument, viz according to the Arc E A, and moove
the edge of the Index to it, which admit to be A Z, then erect the
perpendicular plate which is at the end of the Index, which suppose A X, now
houlding the Instrument, parallel, to the Horizon, let S, represent the sun,
which if at that instant the shadow of the perpendicular, or beam of the sun
shall pass by the side of the Index A Z, then the plain M N, is full South,
and ha h no declination, but if the beam of the sun, or shadow of the
prependicular, fall, from the side of the Index the Plain M N, does decline,
and is equal to the Angle made with the said shadow, and the Index A Z, which
suppose to be A D, so the Declination of the Plain M N, is equal to the Angle
D A Z, therefore moove the Index until the shadow of the perpendicular of the
Index, A X, fall by the side of mathematical diagramthe Index which will be at
G, so the number of degrees contained between A, and G, in the Limb of the
Quadrant, is the declination of the Plain or Wall, M N, required.

Thus for the Construction of the aforesaid 13. uses which did depend upon the
suns observation, the 48. 49. 50. 9. 13. 14. and 15th. uses of the Index or
Table against Page the first, should have followed; but before I speak of them
it will not be inconvenient that I apply the Instrument unto the resolution of
the 44. 45. 46. and 47. uses of the aforesaid Index or Table, which have
reference to night observation, upon such Stars which are, or may be placed
on the face of the Instrument, between the two Tropickes, or under the
Tropicke of Cancer, according to there Declinations, and right Ascentions:
which are these following.

Much may be said upon the uses of these stars, but for brevitie I only
delivere these four examples following.

1. First, for any night of the year, to find at what hour, and Altitude any
of the said stars will be in the Meridian, (that so they may be known.)

2. To know at any day, at what hour any of these stars rises, or sets,
with their time of continuance above the Horizon, and in what part of the
Hemispheare, they may be seen with their Azimuth, and Altitude at any hour.

3. Thirdly, to find in any night at what part of the Horizon, any of the
aforesaid stars rises, or sets, and at what hour, and Altitude they will
be due East, or West.

4. Fourthly, upon the sight or appearance of any of the said Stars, to find
the Azimuth thereof: and the hour of the night.


By the sixth Pro: find the Suns rigth Ascension for the day given, which
converted into time by allowing for every 15. degrees an hour, and for every
degree 4. m, then substract this right Ascension of the Sun, from the stars
right Ascension, so the remainder or difference of time, shall show how many
hours the stars shall come later to the Meridian then the Sun: but if the
subtraction cannot be made, then add 24. hours to it and you have the
Answer, so, if upon the sixth of February, it were required to find at what
hour any of the aforesaid stars will be in the Meridian, or due South, first
therefore by the said sixth Pro. I find the suns right Ascension for the day
given viz, 330. gr. which contains three nineties or 270. each 90. gr. being
six hours, and so the whole 270. gr. makes 18. hours, and the other 60. gr.
at 15. gr. to an hour makes 4. hours more all which put together makes 22.
hours: so the right Ascension of the Sun the sixth of February, is near 330.
gr. as before, or 22. hours

H. M. H. M. Which 22. hours taken from the right ascension of the aforesaid
Stars, viz. from. Ex. Ala Pegasi. 23.54. there remains. 1. 54. P. the time of
the stars being in the Meridian. Pri.. 1. 46. 3. 46. P. Oculus.. 4. 15. 6.

For seeing that 22. hours the Suns right Ascension, is greater then the
right Ascension of any of the stars before specified, substract this 22,
hours from 24. hours, rest 2. hours, which added to the right Ascension of
each Star before delivered, you have the hour of the Stars coming to the
Meridian: hence you may gather which of those stars, are out of observation
for that time, viz. Alae Pegasi, Pri., and Aquila, which come to the Meridian
in the day time: but if the day given had been the 26th of July, the right
Ascension of the Sun, that day is near 135. gr. or 9. hours.

H.M. H.M. which 9. hours taken from the right Ascension of the aforesaid
stars viz, from. Ex. Alae Pegasi. 23. 54. leaves. 2. 54. A. the time of the
stars coming to the Meridian. Pri.. 1. 46. 04.46. A. Oculus. 4. 15. 07. 15. A.

For the right Ascension of the Sun being but 9. hours take it from the right
ascension of Cor. hidra which is 9. hours 10. m, rest 10. m, which shows
that Cor. Hydra comes to the Meridian 10. m, later then the Sun that day, that
is, 10. m, after 12 and so the rest, whose rightascention is greater then the
Suns. But for these stars, whose right Ascension is less then the said 9.
hours, subtract this 9 hour from 24. hours, rest 15. hour (or rather
subtract it from 12. rest 3. hours) this add unto the right ascension of any
of the aforesaid stars, as suppose Canis Minor makes 22. hours 20. m, which
shows that Canis minor, will come to the Meridian. 22. hours 20, m, later
that day then the sun: therefore this, 22. hours and 20. m, being considered
according to an hourly account shows, that Canis Minor will come to the
Meridian at 10. of the clock and 20. m: of the next day (the right ascension
of the Internal of time being neglected) or for brevitie add the aforesaid 3.
hours unto the right ascension of these Stars, whose right ascentions are
lesser then the Suns, so have you the Meridionall hour required.

Hence may be gathered that Alae Pegasi, Pri. and Aquila, are only for
observation that night, the other stars are out of observation, and will come
to the Meridian, in the day time.

Lastly, to find the Meridionall Altitude of any of these stars, lay the
edge of the Index unto the hour line, of 12, so the parallel of the stars
declination that crosses the edge of the Index, shall there show you in the
Index, the Meridionall Altitude of the star required.


By the last direction find the hour of the stars being in the Meridian, then
mark what hour the parallel of the declination of any star intersecteth the
Horizon or Calendar, so have you the hour or time of the stars rising or
setting, and the number of hours, from that point of the stars rising in the
Horizon, unto the Meridian being doubled, gives the countinuance of the stars
above the Horizon, required.

So if upon the 6th. of February, it were demanded at what hour Oculus.
Horizon. By the last proposition, get the hour of the stars being in the
Meridian, which is at 6. of the Clock and 15. minutes at night, and mark the
Number of hours between the Meridian, and that point where the parallel of
Oculus, meets with the Calendar, which is 7. hours 24, minutes, this doubled
makes 14. hours 48. m, and so long will Oculus, be above the Horizon.

But if from the said 7, hours and 24. m, the said 6, hours 15. m, be taken,
there will rest 1. hour 9. m, and so much before 12. of the clock at noone,
does Oculus rise, that is 51. m, after 10, of the Clock, and so consequently
if the said 7. hours and 24. m, be added unto the hour of the stars being
in the Meridian, viz. 6. of the Clock and 15. m, as before, the said star
will set at 39. m, past 1, in the Morning.

Lastly, if at any hour between the rising of the star, and the setting
thereof, it be required at what Position and Altitude the star is in. It is
thus done.

Account to the given hour, from the hour of the star rising, setting, or
being in the Meridian, Index thereto, so the edge of it in the Limb of the
Instrument, shall show the stars Azimuth or Position, and where the parallel
of the stars Declination crosses the edge of the Index, that shall be the
stars Altitude, at that hour.

So if on the said 6th. of February, at 11. Clock at night, it were required
in what Position, or Azimuth Oculus, was in, and also how high above the
Horizon: I make, or suppose the hour of 12. to be the aforesaid 6. of the
Clock and 15. m, (for at that hour as before Oculus was in the Mridian) and
from thence in the stars parallel of Declination, I account until I come unto
11. of the Clock, viz. that is 4. hours, and 45. m, from 12. and lay the
Index thereto, so the edge of the Index in the Limb, points out 4. gr: 24.
m, and so far Oculus, is distant from the West at 11. of the Clock at night,
and the parallel of the stars Declination meets with the Index in 24. gr,
near, which is the stars Altitude, at that hour required.


For the first, Mark where the parallel of the stars declination crosses
the Horizon, or Calendar, Lay the edge of the Index hereto, so the number of
degrees between the edge of the Index, and the point of East or West, upon the
limb of the Instrument, shows the distance of the stars rising from the
East or West.

So if it were required in what part of the Horizon Oculus rises, stars
Declination crosses the Horizon, and lay the edge of the Index thereto, so it
cutteth the Limb of the Instrument from the East near 26. gr. and so far
Oculus, rises from the East toward the North.

For the second to find the time of a stars coming East, or west.

By the 40th. Pro. consider at what hour the star Meridian, then lay the edge
of the Index to the point of East and West, and account in the parallel of the
stars Declination the number of hours between the edge of the Index, and the
hour of 12. which being taken from the hour of the stars being in the
Meridian, gives the hour of the stars coming East, but added unto the hour of
the stars being in the Meridian, shows the hour of the stars being West.

So if it were demanded at what hour, February, Cor, would be due East or
West, and what Altitude the star should then have. First, lay the edge of the
Index, to the point of East and West, and wheresoever the parallel of the
stars declination crosses the edge of the Index that shall be the stars
Altitude, viz. near 17. gr 45. m, then account the number of hours in the
parallel of the stars Declination between the edge of the Index, and the
hour of 12. which is near 5. hours and 12. m, which taken from the hour of
the stars being in the Meridian,) which by the 40th. Pro. was at 11. of the
clock and 48. m, at night) rests 6 hours, and 36. m: but if the said 5.
hours and 12. m, be added unto the said 11. hours and 48. m, it makes 17.
hours, from which 12. being taken leaves 5, hours. So upon the 6th. of
February, Cor shall be due East, at 36. m, past 6, at night, and due West, at
5, of the Clock in the Morning, and the Stars Altitude, being either East or
West, is near 17. gr. 45. m, as was required.


By the 40th. Pro. for the day given find the hour of the stars coming to
the Merid^^ then by the 27. Pro. take the stars heigh^ (...) account that
height in the Index, the^ (...) Index until the degree of the starre^ (...)
the Index, meet with the parall^ (...) Declination, so the edge of the (...)
shows the stars Azimuth, and the Meridian that meets with the degree of
the Altitude, in the Index shall show you the hour that the star wants to be
in the Meridian, or is past the Meridian, which added, or subtracted from the
hour of the stars being in the Meridian, gives the hour of the night
required.

So if the day were the 26th. of July, Aquila, should be observed to be on the
West of the Meridian, 29. gr. 20. m, high above the Horizon, this I seek out
upon the Index, and move the Index to and fro until the said, 29. gr. 20. m,
meet with the parallel of Declination, of Aquila, so the edge of the Index, in
the Limb does point out the stars Azimuth from the South, viz. 63. gr. 12.
m, and the Meridian that meets with the aforesaid degree of Altitude, is the
time of the stars distance from the Meridian, viz. near 3. hours and 28. m,
this added unto the hour of Aquilas being in the Meridian, which by the 40th.
Pro. was at 10. of the Clock and 32. m, at night, makes 14. hours, or 2 of
the Clock, in the Morning, so if Aquila were observed the 26th. of July, to be
29. gr. 20. m, high to the West of the Meridian, then the Position or Azimuth
of that star from the Meridian, was 63. gr. 12. m, and the hour at that
instant, was at 2. of the Clock in the Morning.

Thus touching the resolution of the aforesaid 44. 45. 46. and 47th. Pro. of
the aforesaid Index or Table, which did belong to Astronomicall observations,
the last uses now follow, viz. 48. 49. 50. 9. 13. 14. and 15th. uses of the
Index or Table, which are only proper to Geometrical Practices, viz. to show
1. How to measure the Quantity of an Angle, or to take the distance of two
Stars. 2. How to measure distances and bredthes. 3. How to take the Circuit
of a figure, or the surueigh of a Place. 4. The inclination of a Plain, or to
Place a Plain Horizontall. 5. Whether an Altitude be in the Point of
libration, or above, or below the level of the eye, and how much. 6. How much
the hight of an Altitude is above the eye, which is accessable, or in
accessable. 7. How to measure any Part of an Altitude, which is not
approachable.


First, how to observe or find the
Let the Istrument be placed upon some Rest, Instrument, may be elevated,
depressed, or be placed Horizontall, as occasion requires, then erect the
sights of the Index, and place the edge of the Index upon the hour line of 12.
the Index so placed look through the sights thereof and moving the Instrument
upon his Rest to and fro, until you see the mark or Star, that makes the
Angle or distance required. Then screw fast the Instrument to the socket, and
move about the Index, until through the sights thereof you see the other mark
or star, so the number of degrees between the edge of the Index and the hour
of 12. in the Limb of the Instrument shall be the measure of ye Angle, or
distance of the two Stars sought for.

Let E and D be two marks or Stars, E A D, or distance E D, be required. The
Instrument, A B M, being placed upon his Rest G H I K, observe one of the
marks or stars as D, through the sights (admit A B,) so the visuall line
shall be A B D, then having made fast the Instrument, move the Index A B,
until through the sights of it you see the other mark or star, E, which
suppose to be in the visuall line, A C E, so the Arc of the Limb of the
Instrument B C, shall be the distance between the two Stars, ED, or the
measure of the Angle E A D, Angles, in the Copious and vast Body of
Mathematical Practices, therefore from the multitude of Examples that might be
raised upon them, or extracted from them, I will only instance for brevitie,
upon these two plain, and ordinary ones following.

mathematical diagram

Secondly, how to measure distances,
Let G F L H, Perimeter of a Fort, and let it be required, that standing at
some convenient place without Musket shot, as admit at Y, the distance between
the points of the Bulwark viz. F and L, as also the measure of the face of
either of the Bulwarks viz. F E, or M L, with the length of the Cortaine D N,
and all the distances from Y, viz. Y F, Y E, Y M, and Y L, were required.

Or suppose O P Q R, were 4 places, whose several ^istances the one from the
other as from O to P, then from P to Q, and from Q to R, and also the several
distances from Y viz. Y O, Y P, Y Q and Y R, were demanded. The Construction
and resolution upon either of these is alike, therefore

Place the Instrument upon his Rest, at Y, and the edge of the Index, upon the
hour of 12. then looking through the sights of the Index, upon some mark
taken at pleasure in the field, which, admit to be S, then observe the first
mark R, so have you the Angle S Y R, which suppose 52. gr. 30. m, then look
to Q, so have you the Angle SYQ, which let be 63. gr. 15. m. then look to P,
so have you the Angle SYP, admit to be 74. gr. 15. m, and lastly look to O, so
have you the Angle S Y O, 123. gr. 15. m: for these Angles are taken with great
facillitie, when once the Instrument is rectified as in the first direction is
specified, for you need not but move the Index, Circular from object to
object, so the Arkes of the Limb of the Instrument as before, from the hour
of 12, unto the edge of the Index, shall show the measure of the several
Angles observed.

Thus at Y, place up a Mark, and in the visuall line, Y S, and measure a
certain distance at pleasure, as admit to S, and suppose it were found to be
900. foot (or 300. yardes) then placing the Instrument at S, upon his Rest,
and laying the edge of the Index to the hour of 12. I move the Instrument
about, until through the sights of the Index I may see the mark which was set
up at my, last station, then make fast the Instrument, and observe O, so have
you the Angle Y S O, which suppose to be 26. gr. 50. m, then look to P, so
have you the Angle Y S P, which let be 55. gr. 50. m, then look to Q, so have
you the Angle Y S Q, which admit to be 60. gr. 15. m, lastly observe R, so have
you the Angle Y S R, 87. gr. In like manner may you observe the Angles at the
Fort from the stations Y, and S, formerly specified all which observations may
be placed down in Tables, as here under appears, which may be called the
Tables of observed Angles.

Now touching the resolution of the point, there is a triple way of operation,
viz. either Arithmeticall, Isntrumental, or Geometrical, each of which being
sufficiently facill, to such which are versed in the documents of Mathematical
Practices, but the later because it is more vulgar, and easiest to be
apprehended, I will instance here upon: which is that part of Geometry,
commonly called Pretraction, a thing so common that almost every one that has
any entrance in Geometry, can perform it according to the ordinary way they
are instructed in. But to facilitate that kind of practice, I advise such as
affect this kind of Practice to use the Protracter, which I use, which is a
plain then sector, having a small hole at the Center, whose two legs from the
Center are made with a sharp edge, but so that they lie flat upon the Paper,
and each of them to be divided into 100 or 1000 divisions with a Quadrantall
Arc or more divided and fastened also at the end of one of the legs, but so
that the Quadrantall, Arc have also an edge to lie flat upon the Paper, and to
slide in at the other leg, so shall it be accommodated and made a fit, and apt
Instrument to find the Quantity of Angles, in a Plot, or to protract Angles,
for service, as follows.

So to search out the distance of O P Q R, Y as was required: by the help of
the former Angles of observations and Protracter, it may be done thus.

Upon a fair leaf of Paper, draw an obscure Y S, and place the edge of one of
the legs of the Protracter thereto, and set a pin in the Center to hold that
leg fast, which suppose at Y, then in the edge of, Protracter from the Center
the account, 900. and make a point upon the Paper, unto which write S, then
account. 52. gr. 30. m, in the Quadrantall Arc (which is the Angle R Y S,
specified in the aforesaid Table of Angles) and move the edge of the other leg
of the Protracter unto it, and by that edge draw the line Y R, then account 63.
gr. 15. m, in the said Quadrantall Arc, and move the former leg, unto it,
and draw the line Y Q, In like manner may you account the rest of the Angles
our of the aforesaid Table of Angles in the former Quadrantall Arc, and so
draw the other lines Y P, and Y O. Lastly, lay the Center of the Protracter
upon S, and the edge of one of the legs thereof upon the line S Y, then in the
Quadrantall Arc account 26. gr. 50. m, which is the Angle Y S O, as is before
specified mathematical diagramin the Table of Angles, and lay the edge of the
other leg of the Protractor unto it, and draw the line S O. Now mark whether
the line S O, meets with the line Y O, which will be at O, so S O, shall be one
of the distances required, and shall be measured or given in the edge of the
Protracter, to be 1526, 1 foot. In like manner account 5^. gr. 50. m, in the
Quadrantall Arc, which is the Angle YSP, and move the edge of the Protracter
to it, and draw the line SP, and also mark where the edge of the Protractor
meets with the line YP, which will be at P, so P S, shall be another distance,
and also measured in the edge of the Protractor as before, viz. 1132. foot. In
like manner may you Protract the other Angles, and so also draw the rest of the
lines, S Q, and S R, then laying the Center of the Protracter upon Y, and one
of the edges being moved to any line, would instantly show you the measure of
that line which is the distance required viz. Y O, 8292. Y P, 9732. Y Q. 937.0,
and Y R, 1384. foot and these measures with the rest are placed opposite to
each Angle, in the aforesaid specified Table of Angles: now if you place the
Center of the Protractor upon O, and move one of the legs to P, so have you
the breadth O P, in the edge of the Protracter, and so of others: Thus for the
first example upon the use of Angles in Breadth and Distances, the second
follows:

Thirdly, how to take the Circuit
Let ABCD, Fortifiers have it, or a field to be ploted as surveyers account it,
or a Figure whose Perimeter is required, as Geometritia^s treat of it. The
Plain Table, Instrument shall be able to do this Service, that can but
accuratly take or measure any Angle, (not that we reject that, but make use of
this for the present) and therefore in this action, it were no loss of time to
make a preambulation about the field, to view the several windings and
turnings thereof, and what Angles with greatest Convenience, and expedition are
to be observed, and what might be omitted, and at the Angles of consequence
there to set up some mark, and upon those Angles to fabricate the whole work:
for here especially is to be noted, that the more Angles that are observed in
any practice, by way of Circumscribing a Field, or Campaigne, the greater, and
more evident shall the error be in the Conclusion.

So in the Figure A B C D, Angles and as many sides, now if at every Angle, an
observation should be made, it would be more. subject to error (as before) then
if less Angles were observed, therefore in this Diagramme fewer Angles of
observation may be fully sufficient to raise that Plain, Take the Plot of the
Field, or give the Perimeter of that Figure, Therefore suppose the noted Angles
of Consequence to be, A, B, C, D, Q, the work may be then thus.

Place the Instrument, upon his rest at A, and observe the Angle Q AB, which
suppose 32. gr. 10 m, then measure Q A, with a Decimall Chain (or such like,)
which suppose to be 5. Chains, note this in a piece of paper, then take the
Instrument up, and measure the line, A B, but first only A E, which suppose to
be 11. Chains and 60 Linkes, which is written down thus. 11. 60. Then measure
the distance from E to the Angle F, which admit to be 2. 20, Lastly, go one
with the measure A B, which suppose to be 15. 00, the Angle of observation, and
measures thus taken may be noted down one against another, as in the Table
following, then place the Instrument B, and observe the Angle: ABC, which note
down also and measure the distance, B G, and G H, and then going on with G B,
to G I, and mark and measure B I, and then measure also I K, and so go on
with B C, which measures are all placed down as appears in the Table of Angles
and measures following: In like matter perform the rest of the work until
you come to Q, and so all the Angles and measures will be according to the
Table here under specified.

The Table of Angles. The Table of measures. G.M. 5. 00. 32.10. 11. 60. 2.20.
15. 00. 80.10. 6. 00. 1.00. 9. 20. 2.00. 16. 40. 79.30. 6. 90. 1. 29. 8. 00.
74. 45. 3. 70. 1. 15. 5. 40.

Having these observations and measures, they may be Protracted thus: upon a
fair sheet or Paper, draw an obscure line as A B, and place the edge of the
Protracter thereto, then keeping the edge of the Protracter fast upon the line
A B, open the other edge to an Angle equal to B A Q, viz. 32. gr. 10. m, then
place the pine in the Center, and make a mark at A, and account in the edge of
the Protracter the measures, of the lines AQ, AE, AB, out of the Table of
measures, and make marks with a pin, or such like at the terms thereof. viz, at
QF, and B, then open the Protracter, at a right Angle, and place the Center
upon E and one the edges of it upon the line AE, so the measure of of the line,
E F, may be accounted in the edge of the Protracter: then draw apparently AF,
and FB, mathematical diagram so have you Protracted a part of the figure, then
lay the Center of the Protracter upon B, and one of the edges upon the line B
A, and open the other edge unto 80. gr. 10. m, according to the Angle A B C,
then in that edge out of the former Table account from the Center B, 6.00 and
make a point at the term thereof, which admit at G, then account 9.20. and at
the end of it make another point, which admit I, lastly, in the edge of the
Protracter account 16.40. and at the end of it make a point, which suppose C,
and according to the former directions Protract also out of the Table of
measures, the measure for G H, and I K, then lastly draw apparntly, B H, H K,
and K C: In like manner may you Protract the rest of the Angles, and measures
out of the aforesaid Table of Measures and Angles, and so the whole Plain A B
C D shall be raised, or the said field Plotted, or the Perimeter of the figure
given, as was required.

But it had been fully sufficient (by help of this Protractor) to have
plotted the aforesaid Plain, by knowing the former Measures, and two Angles of
observation only.


For the first, Set the East and West, edge of the Instrument unto the Plain,
then if the edge of the Index in the Limb of the Instrument, cut the point of
East or West, the Plain is vertical, and does not Incline, but if the Index
fall from the points, look how many degrees it is from the points of East or
West in the Limb of the Instrument so much is that Inclination of the Plain.

For the Second, to Elevate a Plain, to an Angle assigned.

This is only the same with the former, but may be applied to several uses,
as to try the mount, or to mount a Piece of Ordinance at any Randon: or to
place Burning glasses (or others) at several Angles, to receive each others
Reflexon, and that the point of concurse, or inflammation in such Glasses may
be in the Radius or beam of the Sun, or that the point of inflammation, the
representative Image, or the extensive Elumination may be proiected to a point
assigned.

For the Third, to rectify a Plain Horizontall.

Place the North and South edge of the Instrument, unto the under face of the
Plain, and then mark if the edge of the Index, cut the points of East or West
in the Limb of the Instrument, for then the Plain is Horizontall, but if it
swarne from that point, then it is not Horizontal, but the Plain is to be
raised, or depressed, until by several trials in sundry parts of the Plain,
you see the edge of the Index fall upon the points of East or West, for then
shall it be truly Horizontall: Otherwise you may rectify the Plain
Horizontall, by operating upon the upper face of it, if you set a Cube upon the
plain, and then placing the East and West edge of the Instrument unto the side
of the Cube, for then the observation will be as the former, and therefore,
accommodated and concluded accordingly.


Let C B and X, be three several objects, and let their several situations be
required.

First, let the Instrument hang upon a rest perpendicular, and let it be held
steadfast that the Index may be vertical, and play easily by the side of the
Instrument, then looking through the sights of it, lift the Instrument up and
down, until you see your mark, which suppose first C, and admit the Index
should cut 5. in the line of shadows, which shows that C, is higher then the
eye by the 5th. part of the distance of the bassis of the object, from the eye,
supposed at A.

Secondly, if through the sights of the Instrument you see the second object, B
and the Index falling upon no part in the line of shadows, then it shows
that the point B, is level with the eye, for if in any observation the Index
fall between the beginning of the line of shadows, (which is near the
beginning of December) and the sight next the eye, it argues that the object is
higher then the eye, but if the Index fall beyond the beginning of the line of
shadows, then the object is lower then the eye.

Thirdly, if you observe the object X, (the A,) then if in observing the Mark
X, through the sights of the Instrument, the Index shall fall beyond the
beginning of the line of shadows, that is from the Calendar number the
degrees, in the Limb from the edge of the Index unto that point, and account
the same backward from the point in the Limb that is opposite to the beginning
of the line of shadows, and lay the edge of the Index unto it, then suppose
the Index, in the line of shadows intersect 8. which shows that the point X
is lower then the level of the eye, by the eight part of the distance from you
to the mark. Now if the distance should be 100. foot, then the point X, shall
be below the Horizontall line, or line of level A B, 12. foot and which is
the part of 100. the distance before specified.

Sixthly, how to find the height of
Let, B C be an Altitude and the eye at, A distant from the Basis of B, 100.
foot.

If through the sights of the Instrument the summet of the Altitude B C, viz.
C, be seen, and the Index falling upon 5, in the line of shadows, Altitude B
C, to be the 5th. part of the distance, viz. of A. B. which is 20. foot. Or let
the Altitude of G, be sought out, whose Basis cannot be seen Admit, the first
station be made at A and seeing the summet of the Altitude G, the Index should
cut 3 in the line of shadows, it Argues that the distance to the Basis of the
Altitude, is triple to the Altitude, then if I should go nearer to the
Altitude, viz. at D, and should observe the summet or top of the Altitude G,
and that the Index should fall upon 1. in the line of shadows, then it shows
that the distance from D, to the Basis of the Altitude is equal to the
Altitude. Now suppose that between D and A were 80. foot it should seem that
the Altitude observed should be 40. foot, for if at D. the distance to the
Altitude be equal to the Altitude, and the distance from A, to the Altitude,
be Triple to the Altitude, then the distance from D to the Altitude is the of
the distance AR, and so AD, shall be double to DR, therefore half the distance
AD, viz. 40. foot is the Altitude required.


Let G H, a part of an Altitude be required to be measured.

First, search out the height G R, as before 40. A and looking to H, through
the sights, the Index should cut 4, which shows the distance from A, to be
Quadruple to the Altitude of H R, and if coming nearer the Altitude 80. foot,
viz. at D, I should observe H again, through the sights of the Instrument, and
find the Index to cut 1, and, in the line of the shadows, then the distance
from D, to the Altitude H R, viz. D R, should contain the Altitude H R, once,
and a third part of the Altitude, now seeing that D R, is 1 and, therefore H R,
shall be 1, but the observation at A showed the distance from A, to the
Altitude H R, to be Quadruple, and seeing that D R, is 1, and 1 part of 3,
therefore A D, must be 2, and 2 parts of 3, which makes A R, the whole distance
to be 4, or Quadruple to H R, but if A B, 2, and 2 parts be 80. foot then D R,
being 1, and 1, part shall be 40 foot, and if D R, 1, and, be 40. foot, then
H R, (which was 1 should be but 30. foot, and so consequently H R,) taken from
G R, there shall remain G H, 10. foot, the measure of the part of the
Altitude required. In like manner might we apply the Instrument to the
measuring of Bredths and distances: but that which is delivered may serve for
the present, and as fully sufficient for the Ingenious.

Conclusion.
I might have Annexed unto this Tractat the demonstration of this Proiection,
which might have satisfied those which are more learned, but to show them it
would be impertinent, seeing the thing lies so obuious: for others, it would
not be respected or regarded, seeing the making, and practical use of the
Instrument, principally and Totally they look after, which I have plentifully
delivered. Now by way of Comparison it is said in the description of Master
Gunters Quadrant, that if a Quadrant were made (as he there relates) unto a
foot semidiameter, it should show the Azimuth unto a degree, and the hour
unto a minute. It is most probable that if this Horlzontal Quadrant have the
same semidiameter, it shall show the hour unto half a minut, and the Azimuth
unto 3 m. And if in this Tractat I have been too obscure (which I have avoided
as much as possible I could,) I entreat the Reader to excuse me. I confess I
might more Methodically have digested it, and more abundantly Amplified it,
howsoever the affectionate I persuade my self will not spurn at that which I
have delivered; as for the Malevolent I way not: my few hours would not permit
me to make a long premeditation of so great a facility. But if any one desire
to say more upon this Horizontall Quadrant, then I have done: I have made way
for him, and vnuailed the subject, to help his sight.
