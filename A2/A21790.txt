By the Queen.
WHereas by the ancient treaties of entrecourses, which from time to time have
been renewed between the Queens Majesty our most gracious sovereign Lady,
and diverse of her highness most noble progenitors, Kings of this Realm, and the
Princes and Lords of the low Countries, it has been always agreed and
thought meet, for the wealth and profit of them both, that there should be a
mutual and free traficke and trade between the merchants of both the
Countries: And thereupon has ensued between them, and the merchants of the
Staple of England, in their staple marchandises, a continual traficke, and
namely in wool and wool felles, for the drapery of sundry of their Towns
there, which through the great troubles, and civil wars lately had in the
said low Countries, has been of late something discontinued, all passages
being either stopped by the enemy, or so full of danger, as no trade could be
conveniently had into those parts, without great peril of loss of the whole
adventures, which impediments are now removed (thanks be to God) in the best
and most commodious places of the said Countries, for the said traficke the
countries of Holland and Zealand being in good peace and quiet, without any
fear or danger of new troubles to fall amongst them, And therefore the people
of the said countries are desirous to renew their former old trade, for thr
which the States of those countries have solicited and sued to her Majesty by
their letters and messengers: The Queens most excellent Majesty, of her great
clemency and godly disposition, having great commiseration and pity of the
afflictions and miseries of the subjects of those parts, and in respect
thereof, and of the said humble request, and being credibly informed, that it
is commodious and not unprofitable for the state of this her Majesty's common
weal, to recontinue the annent anutie and entrecourse with her said neighbors
of the low Countries. And that through and by the discontinuance of the said
trade of the merchants of the Staple of late years, all wool felles, as well
marchantable as others, have been and are altogether pulled and the wool
thereof for the most part, wrought by strangers here in England, into sundry
new and unnecessary devises not profitable for the Realm: Her Majesty
therefore by the advice of her most honorable privy Counsel, intending to
prevent those mischiefs, and to provide remedy for the premises, as also
being willing to satisfy and relieve the said subjects of the low Countries,
and to avoid diverse other inconveniences that may grow and ensue, if the
inordinate pulling of marchantable wool fels should not be restrained,
straightly charge and commands, that from Shroue Tuesday next coming
after the date hereof, and so yearly from that day commonly called Shroue
Tuesday, as it shall fall, until the last day of June yearly following, no
manner of person of persons, upon pain of her Majesty's indignation,
displeasure and imprisonment, and further punishment at her Highness pleasure,
by any ways, art, or means, directly or indirectly, shall pull or clippe, or
cause to be pulled or clipped, any manner of wool fell, commonly called
Marchantable or Staple felles, accustomed heretofore to be dried for the
merchants of the Staple, but that all the same marchantable and Staple felles,
falling by slaughter or otherwise, from the said Shroue Tuesday until the last
day of June yearly be dried, according to the form and true meaning of this
Proclamation. And for the better execution hereof, her Majesty by the advice
aforesaid, straightly charge and commands all and singular her Justices of
the peace, Majors, Sherifes, Baylifes and other head officers, of any Counties
or Shires within the Realm, as well within liberties as without, not only as
much as in them lies, to see this present Proclamation truly executed, but
also if any person be justly accused before him or them, for contemning or
breaking this Proclamation, or any part thereof, they shall commit such party
to ward, there to remain without bail or mainprise, till her Majesty's and
her most honorable Counsels pleasure be further known. Provided always, that
if before the first day of August, every year yearly, all such marchantable
wool felles be not bought by the merchants of the Staple, that then it shall
be lawful for the Felmongers, Glouers, and other persons, to pull all such
felles as shall be then remaining and unbought of the former years growth, any
thing in this present Proclamation to the contrary notwithstanding, And this
Proclamation to continue during her Majesty's pleasure.

Given at her Majesty's Palace of Westminster, the xxviii. day of February, in
the one and twentieth year of her Reign.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens Majesty.
