By the Queen.
A Proclamation for horsemen and breed of horses for service.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty, fynding by the view of the last
certificat of Musters, the number of Horsemen, especially in certain
Countries, to be much less then she looked for, considering the great charge
that from time to time has been given, by letters directed by her highness
express commandment from her Privy Counsel, unto such of the Justices of
peace, to whom the principal care of the musters has been committed, to see
as well such Laws and statutes put in execution, as tended to the maintenance
of Horsemen, as also other good orders and directions sent to the said
Justices tending to the same end: And also being given to understand, that the
most necessary and profitable laws, provided for the breed and increase of
horses, are either not at all put in execution, or very negligently, whereby
the number of serviceable Horses, yt heretofore have been bred within this
realm, is greatly decayed, by reason whereof great numbers of her Majesty's
subjects be in danger of great penalties, if her Majesty should seek the
due execution of her laws: For reformation whereof, her highness has found
it very expedient, to make choice of certain principal Noble men of this
Realm, and others of her Privy Counsel, to whom she has of late given
authority under the great Seal of this Realm, to see due execution of the
Laws and Statutes of this Realm provided in that behalf, and of such other
orders as heretofore have been taken, or by them may be devised hereafter,
as well for the increase of the number of horsemen, as also for the breed of
Horses. And for that the due execution of the said statutes and orders tend to
a common defense of the Realm, wherein every good and faithful subject is
interessed and ought to be careful of the same, and therefore the punishing with
all severity, of such as be found offenders therein, is very necessary: Her
most excellent Majesty, having a gracious disposition to have her subjects
forewarned of her good pleasure and intention, has thought it very necessary
and expedient, both to notify unto her said subjects the great mislike she
has of the remisnesses, that has been heretofore used in a matter tending
only to ye surety of her person, the public defense of her Dominions, and
the particular benefit of every good subject, and not meant to be a president to
draw any person into any other charge or burden, As also to let them
understand, that from henceforth, after admonition given by publishing of this
present proclamation, whosoever shall be found to offend in the premises, shall
receive such punishment, as by the Laws and orders of this Realm, may any
ways be inflicted upon them. For the due execution whereof she has given a
special chardge, and straight commandment to the said Commissioners, to see
such as shall be hereafter found offenders, punished with all severity: willing
also and commanding all Justices of peace, and other public ministers, to see
due execution of such orders, as shall by the said Commissioners from time to
time be devised and set forth for the better advancement of this service, as
they will answer it at their uttermost peril.

Given at her Majesty's Palace at Westminster the xiiii. day of April, 1580.
in the two and twentieth year of her highness reign.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, printer to the Queens most
excellent Majesty.
