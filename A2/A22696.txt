A Declaration of the just causes moving the Queens Majesty to send a Navy,
and Army to the Seas, and toward Spain.
ALthough the Queens Majesty as a Sovereign Prince, and Queen, is not (for
respect of any person) bound to make account, or declare to the world the
causes for justification of any her public actions: yet least any sinister, or
doubtful interpretation should be made, by the diversity of opinions, either
of Strangers, or of her own natural Subjects, of her present preparations of
a Navy, and an Army, now committed to the Earl of Essex, as her General,
with diverse Noble men, and other persons of credit and reputation, to serve
with him both by Sea and Land: Her Majesty would have it understood for a very
truth, that she is moved hereunto, only for defense of the State of her
own Kingdoms, and people, against the apparent preparations of great Forces,
put in readiness by the King of Spain, to offend her Majesty sundry ways,
and specially to invade her Realm of Ireland. In which desseigne he was so
far proceeded in the beginning of this last Winter, that he had amassed
together as great a number of Ships to serve in the said action, as he could
furnish from all parts of his Dominions, or could recover, by imbarging all
other Ships of service, which came for trade into Spain or Portugal. And yet
such was the providence of God, contrary to that Kings hope, and intention, (by
hastening of his Enterprise in a time unlooked for) to surprise some place in
England or Ireland, before her Majesty could have had her own Force in
readiness, she still providing (but that she is daily provoked) to have
lived in Peace, which she professes to wish both to her self, and all
Christendom, as it pleased him who from Heaven with Justice beholds all men's
purposes, condemning the tyrannous disturbers of the world, and comforting
such as for Peace withstand violence) suddenly and most strangely to drown and
make unserviceable diverse of his best Ships of war, being under sail coming
from Lisbone, and very near to the destined Haven of Ferroll, with destruction
of no small numbers of soldiers and Mariners. Amongst which, many of those
Irish Rebels of all sorts of professions both tituler Bishops, and other Irish
people, that were entertained in Spain, to have accompanied either that Navy
or some part thereof into Ireland, were also cast away. By which manifest act
of Almighty God, that Army was so weakened, as the same could not put to the
Seas, according to his former desseigne: and yet nevertheless, as it
manifestly has appeared, the King of Spain not being warned by this just
punishment by Gods ordinance, without resistance by any outward Force, but
forgetting how by the favor of Almighty God, his proud Navy in the year
eighty eight, was overthrown by our Forces, and notwithstanding his loss at
Cales by her Majesty's Army, which she was in like sort constrained for her
safety to defeat, (all being but the preparatiues to some dangerous action
against her) such is still his malice, (although he find that both by God and
man he is impeached in his iniust pretenses,) as he has hastened to make all
manner of new preparations of Shipping, and of men and victual, and munitions,
greater then all Spain and Portugal could yield, and therefore has sent
into Italy, and to the East Countries for all things necessary to repair
his Army at Ferroll, to pursue his former purpose, and in the mean time has
sent certain Captains in sundry small Vessels, with a remnant of some Irish
Fugitives into Ireland, to animate the Rebels to be obstinate in their
Rebellion, until he might send them succors, not only feeding the
Principals with hope of vain Titles, and Dignities, but plainly auowing the
usurpation of the whole Realm for himself, to the deprivation of her
Majesty's Crown and State of that Kingdom, a matter so far known, and
proved, as besides that, it is most notorious, that his Army was in October
last on the high way toward their journey, the Capital Traitor Tyrone
himself, has sent to her Governor of that Realm, a letter signed with the
King of Spaines own name, to the purposes aforesaid. Now then that these the
King of Spaines actions and purposes, are manifestly known, and the reparation
of his Navy daily labored, and an Army newly leuyed, with all necessaries of
Victual and Munition, brought to Ferroll fit for such an enterprise, so as his
sending to the Seas (as soon as those difficulties are overcome) is daily
expected, and so publicly diuulged without giving color for any other
purpose. And seeing her Majesty does find the Rebels in Ireland persist
still in general expectation to be relieved with a Spanish Navy: Her Majesty
of her Princely providence for the safety of both her Kingdoms, does appeal
to all the world whether she be not necessarily enforced, to send out this
Army to the Seas, to resist and divert all Acts of Hostility which that Army
of Spain, might now this Summer time attempt against either of her realms of
England or Ireland, her Navy being compounded of a competent number of her
Majesty's own Ships of war without burdening of her Subjects for service
with their Port ships (as in former times) but retaining the Admiral of her
Kingdom in readiness with the rest of her Royal Ships, to withstand all
other accidents that might appear dangerous in these parts near her. To all
which courses her excellent Majesty being thus provoked, this her purpose may
and ought not only to be allowed, but favored, and furthered by all Christian
Princes, States, and people, the same being so affected generally by her own
Subjects as she is justly moved to deny the suits of great numbers of her
Nobility and valiant Gentlemen, who having importuned her for leave to serve
as Voluntaries in this Voyage, she has stayed great part of them to do her
service at home. And therefore little doubts, but by continuance of Gods
favor (whereof she has hy sundry special and notable blessings had singular
demonstration) to preserve her Kingdoms by her Forces, thus timely provided,
and shadowed under the favor of Almighty God, who has hitherto, and will
hereafter see these Spanish, proud, and unjust attempts, made frustrate,
whereby the King may by the chastisement of the Almighty God of Hosts, be
induced to live in Peace with his neighbors, which all just Princes propound
for an end of all their Martial actions.
