CHARLES, By the Grace of God King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland,
Defender of the Faith, etc.
To all and singular Archbishops, Bishops, Archdeacons, Deanes, and their
Officials; Parsons, Vicars, Curates, and to all spiritual Persons. And also to
all Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Bayliffes, Constables, Churchwardens,
and Headboroughes; And to all Officers of Cities, Boroughs, and Towns
Corporate; And to all other our Officers, Ministers and Subjects whatsoever
they be, as well within Liberties, as without, to whom these Presents shall
come, Greeting.
WHEREAS by the humble Supplication and Petition of our loving Servant sir
Richard Graham, knight and Baronet, one of Our Queries, We are credibly given
to understand that he has formerly had a grant under Our great Seal, and
Duchy seal, for the building of the Church of Kirkeanders, with two Chapels
of Ease, within our County of Cumberland, bordering upon Our kingdom of
Scotland, for the better education and instruction of the people there, for
want to which they are run into many inconveniences. And that Our Servant has
proceeded for the finishing thereof, so far as his ability will extend, and
cannot finish it; the charge thereof being too great for him to undergo, and
has therefore most humbly besought Us that according to Our Princely zeal to
works of this nature, We would be graciously pleased to grant unto him Our
Letters Patents for some help to be made therein by way of a Collection of
the charity of weldlsposed people. And whereas upon further consideration taken
of this extraordinary case, we are given to understand by special Certificats,
under the hands of our trusty and well-beloved Subjects sir Phillip Musgraue, and
sir Patrick Curwen, Baronets, sir Edward Musgraue, sir George Dalston, sir
Henry Blincowe, sir John Lowther, sir Thomas Carleton, and sir Thomas Dacre
knights, and Anthony Hutton, Esquior Justices of the Peace within our foresaid
county of Cumberland, That our Royal Father King James of blessed memory, did
for the Church of Arthurett adjoining, grant a Collection by way of a Brief
toward so charitable work, by which means the said Church is built all but
the Steeple, But the Church of Kirkeanders lies as yet unbuilt, and the
Parishioners thereof are enforced to go to Arthurett Church over the River
Eske. When they can pass for the said River which is very seldom, their being
neither Church nor Chapel in the Parish of Kirkeanders for reading divine
service, And therefore they have commended the same unto us, And that they have
also seen an estimate of the Charge, under the hands of Masons, Carpenters,
and Ioyners, which will Amount unto the Sum of Three Thomsand Pounds at the
least, for building the Church and Two Chapels of Ease, according to our late
direction under our great Seal and Duchy Seal, And therefore they have
likewise des^^ed our furtherance therein for so pyous a work, it being the
principal m^anes to inform our Subjects therein the true grounds of
Christianity, hereof they stand in great need. Now forasmuch as we tendering the
glory of God, and comfort and Salvation of the Souls of our loving Subjects,
as also upon the humble request of our foresaid Justices, and likewise upon the
humble Petition of Our foresaid Servant sir Richard Graham, have condiscended
thereunto, for a Collection to be made within certain Counties and places
hereafter mentioned: Not doubting, but that all good Christians considering the
premises, will be ready and willing, (and the rather for Our Commendation,) to
extend their liberal contributions, toward the furtherance of so goodly and
religious a work.

KNOW Ye therefore, that of Our especial grace and Princely compassion We have
given and granted, and these Our Letters Patents do give and grant unto Our
said Servant sir Richard Graham, and to his Deputy and Deputies, the Bearer or
Bearers hereof, full power, License and authority, to ask, gather receive, and
take the Alms and chapitable benevolence of all Our loving Subjects,
