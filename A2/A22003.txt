Commonwealth, And specially in our Progress within ye Verge of our Court,
where our Nobility, Servants, and Trame (daily attending upon our Person) are
lodged and placed by our Harbingers, are unlawfully exacted upon with
unreasonable and extreme Prices by the said Victualers, enhaunsing the same
Victuals, Horsemeate, Lodgings, and all other necessaries, at a more dear
Price then it was sold for before our coming in Progress: Therefore our will

Rated by the Clerks of the Market of our Household within the Verge of our
Court, as well within Liberties as without, and the Jury before him, or his

any City, Borough, Town, or other the Inhabitants of the same, and other our
