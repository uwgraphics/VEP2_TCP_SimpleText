By the King. A Proclamation to prevent the furnishing of the King of Spain
and his Subjects, with provisions for Shipping, or Munition for the Wars, and
with Victuals.
WHereas His Majesty by His Royal Proclamation, bearing date the one and
thirtieth of December, in the first year of His Highness Reign, for special
causes therein at large expressed, did notify to all manner of persons of all
conditions, that should send or carry into Spain, Portugal, Burgundy, or any
other of the King of Spaines Countries or Dominions, any manner of Grain or
other Victuals, or any manner of Provisions, to Serve, Build, Furnish, or Arm
any Ships of War, or any kind of Munition for the War, or materials for
the same, being not of the nature of mere Merchandise; That He would not
only authorize His own Admiralls and Captains of His own Ships of War,
but would also allow and approve all other His Subjects to Arm their Ships,
and with them to impeach and arrest all Ships that should Sail, either out
of the East parts, or out of the Low Countries, or from any other Parts, with
intention to pass to Spain, Portugal, Burgundy, or any other of the King of
Spaines Countries or Dominions, or to any the said King of Spaines Ships being
on the Seas, having on Board any such Grain, Victual, Provisions of War, or
Furniture for Shipping, or materials for the same; and the same to bring into
the next good Port, there to be ordered as goods duly forfeited; the causes
whereof being not only notoriously known to be most true, but also much
conducing to the common good of all His Majesty's Confederates and Allies in
Christendom, as in the said Proclamation is set forth, His Majesty well
hoped would have produced that good effect which was desired.

But because it is found by experience, that in all States there will be some
ill disposed persons with whom private and particular gain and advantage will
more prevail then any public respects, of what consequence soever; His
Majesty intending to remove all pretexts of ignorance or other exceptions,
which may be taken against the proceedings of His Judges and Officers, with any
the Subjects of His Friends, Confederats, or Allies, who shall hereafter offend
in the Premises, has thought fit by these Presents to make further
declaration as well of the Species or kinds of the things so Prohibited, as of
the penalties to be suffered by the parties delinquent in supplying the Enemies
with the same prohibited things. Concerning therefore those kinds wherewith His
Majesty may not suffer His said Enemies to be furnished, His Majesty does by
these presents publish and notify, that He holds these things following to
be of that quality and condition; viz. Ordinance, Arms of all sorts, Powder,
Shot, Match, Brimstone, Copper, Iron, Cordage of all kinds; Hemp, Sail,
Canuas, and Dantse-Pouldauis, Cables, Anchors, Masts, Rafters, Boate-Oares,
Balcks, Capraues, Deale-board, Clap-board, Pipe-staues, and Vessels and
Vessel stuff, Pitch, Tar, Rozen, Okam, Corn, Grain, and Victuals of all
sorts, all Provisions for Shipping, and all Munition of War, or of Provisions
for the same, according to former Declarations and Acts of State, made in this
behalf in the time of Queen Elizabeth of famous memory.

And therefore if any Person whatsoever after Three Months, from the
publication of these Presents, shall by any of His Majesty's own Ships, or the
Ships of any His Subjects Authorized to that effect, be taken Sailing toward
the places aforesaid, having on board any of the things aforesaid, or returning
thence in the same Voyage, having vented or disposed of the said Prohibited
goods, His Majesty will hold both the Ships and Goods so taken for lawful
prize, and cause them to be ordered as duly forfeited; whereby as His Majesty
does put in practice no Innovation, since the same course has been held, and
the same penalties have been heretofore inflicted by other States and Princes
upon the like occasions, and auowed and maintained by public writings and
Apologies; So now His Majesty is in a manner enforced thereunto by
Proclamations set forth by the King of Spain and the Archduchesse, in which
the same and greater severity is professed against those that shall carry or
have carried, without limitation, the like Commodities into these His Majesty's
Dominions.

Given at Our Court at New Market the fourth day of March, in the second year
of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXVI.
