By the Queen.
THe Queens Majesty understanding of the common wandering abroad of a great
multitude of her people, whereof the most part pretend, that they have served
in the wars of late on the other side of the Seas, though in truth it is
known, that very mante of them, either have not served at all, or have been
licenced to depart from the places of their service, as they ought to have
been, but have run away from their service, and therefore they are fustly to
be punished, and not to be relieved: some others are such as have indeed
served, and fallen into sickensse, and therefore lienced to depart toward
their Countries, from whence they were levied, and do deserve relief, To the
intent all her Majesty's Officers of Justice in every place, where these sorts
of people shall resort, may know, what her Majesty's most gracio pleasure is,
for the usage of the said persons, both to punish the offenders, and to
relieve the siche soldiers, and such as have truly served, and are licenced
to depart to their Countries: She commands that such discretion be used
berwixt the unlawful vagarant persons, and the soldiers now lawfully
dismissed from their services, that all such vagarant persons, as neither have
been brought to sickness nor lamenesse by the said late service, and that
shall not be able to she we sufficient pasport for their dismission, shall be
taken and apprehended, wheresoever they may be found, as persons vagabonds, and
so to be punished. And if any of them shall allege, that they have been in
her Majesty's pay on the other side the Seas, and cannot she we sufficient
pasport from the Lord General, or some of the principal Officers of the
army, then to be taken and committed to prison, and to be indicted as felons,
and to suffer for the same, as soldiers being in her Majesty's pay, that have
run away, and left the service traitorously. And for the rest that have
served as soldiers, and can she we their lawful pasports, they ought to be
relieved by some charitable means, to conduct them into their Country, with
commendation of public Letters from the Justices of the Peace where they
shall be found, to all other Ministers both spiritual and temporal, both to
grant them reasonable relief and aid for their passage, and to be
particularly relieved by the Parishes or Hundreds, from whence they were levied
during the time of their infirmities and sickness, as in conscience they
ought, and so to be placed with their former Masters, as by her Majesty's late
directions to the Counties has been ordered and appointed: And nevertheless,
with special pains to be added to the same Letters of commendations of
Pasports, that if they shall be found to wander abroad out of the ordinary
ways mentioned in their Pasports, that then, they are to be punished as
vagabonds.

And her Majesty lets it to be known, that order is given by her, that her
Treasorer of wars has and shall make payment (in every Port where any such
shall arrive coming with lawful Pasport) of such sums of money, as shall be
conuentient to conduct them to the places from which they were levied. And that
all Officers of Ports shall be allowed by the said Treasorer any such sums of
money, as by them shall be paid to any such lawful soldiers. And
furthermore, for the repressing of the great number of mighty and hable
vagarant persons now wandering abroad under pretense of begging as soldiers,
although in deed they are known to commit open robberies upon her Majesty's
poor subjects and trauaillers by the way: Her Majesty straightly charge all
her Lieutenantes of every County within the Realm (having sufficient warrant
by their Commission to execute Martial Law upon such offenders against the
public peace and state of the Realm) to appoint some special persons within
their jurisdictions to travel within the Counties as Proust-Marshals, and to
give directions to the Justices of the Peace to assist the Prouoff-Marshall,
for the apprehension of all such notable offenders, and to commit them to
prison, and thereupon to be executed, as by the Laws of the Realm they shall
deserve.

Given our Manor of Richmond, the fifth day of November and in the three and
thirtieth year of our reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty. 1591.
