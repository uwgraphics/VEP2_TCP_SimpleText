Advice to the City or the Wiggs Loyalty explained
^Remember ye wiggs what was formerly done, remember your mischeifs in forty
and one, when ^friend opposs'd friend, and father the son, then then the old
cause, went rarely on the cap sat aloft and low was the ^crown ye Rabble got up,
and the nobles went down, Lay elders in tubbs. ruled Bishops in robes. who
^mourn'd ye sad fate and dreadful disaster, of their royal master. by rebels
betra'ed. Then ^London be wise and baffle their power and let them play ye old
game no more, hang hang up the Shr, those baboons in ^power, those popular
theives. those rats of ye Tower, whose canting tale ye rabble believes in a
hurry, and never sorry ^merrily they still go on, fie for shame wee'r to tame,
since they clame ye combatt, Tan ta ra ra ra tan, ta ra ra ra, ^Dub, a dub, a
let ye Drum beat the strong militia guard the throne.

When faction posseses the popular voice
The cause is supplied still with nonsense and noise
And Tony their speaker the rabble leads on
He knows if we prosper that he must run
Carolina must be his next station of ease
And London be rid of her worst desease
From plotts and from spies
From treason and lies
We, shall ever be free
And the law shall be able
To punish a Rebel
as cuning as he: then London etc.
Rebellion never wanted a loyal pretense
These Villains swear all is for ye good of their Prince
Oppose our elections to show what they dare
And loosing their Charter arrest the Mayor
Fool Ji^. was the first o'th aickouldly crew
With EllJ. and Jeaka. and Hub^. the Jew
Famed sparks of the town
For wealth and renown
Give the Divill his due
And such as we fear
Had their Sovereign been there
had arrested him too: then London etc.
