A Proclamation for registring of Knights.
WHereas We have taken knowledge of many and great inconveniences, daily
arising for want of an exact Roll kept in the Office of Arms, of such as have
received from Us the Order of Knighthood, whereby some have presumed to
challenge that dignity, upon whom the same was never confered, and amongst
them that were indeed knighted, often questions arise for precedencie, which
cannot be decided for whant of a Record kept thereof: For redress whereof We
directed Our Letters, dated the fifteenth day of Day last, to Our right trusty
and right well-beloved Cousin and Counselor, Thomas Earl of Arundel and Surrey,
Our Earl Marshal of England, That, according as appertains to that his
Office, he should take ordertherein. Nevertheless, by reason of the
slacknesse and negligence of such as have been by Us advanced unto that
degree, in not giving notice thereof to the said Earl Marshall or his Deputy,
Our said Letters have not taken effect according to Our intent.

We do therefore hereby publish and declare Our Royal pleasure, and do
straightly charge and command, That all such persons, as sithence the said
fifteenth day of May last past have received that dignity, shall within three
months after the publishing of this Our Proclamation, and all others that
shall hereafter receive the like dignity from Us, or any Our Lieutenants,
shall within one month after they have received the same, within this Our
Realm of England, or within one month next after their coming into this
Realm, if they receive the same out of the Realm, bring, or cause to be
brought, a sufficient Certificate thereof, and of the time thereof, to Our
Earl Marshall of England for the time being, or to such other person or
persons as he shall appoint, to the end the same may be registed in a Roll,
to be therefore kept in the Office of Arms, upon pain that every person
neglecting to bring such Certificate, shall lose the benefit of his due
Precedencie, and in all Commissions, employments, and places, shall be ranked
after such as, upon like Certificate brought, shall be registered before them.
And We do like wise signify and declare Our pleasure to be, That all such
as, at any time before the said fifteenth day of May last past, did receive the
said Order of knighthood at Our hands, shall at any time hereafter bring such
Certificate, as aforesaid, and shall have the same registered, as aforesaid, for
clearing all controversies and questions that may arise touching their
Precedencie.

Given at Our Court at Windsor the five and twentieth day of April, in the one
and twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXIII.
