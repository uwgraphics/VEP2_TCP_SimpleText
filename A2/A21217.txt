snare not reversed; in any-wise; one-anothers Conscience through any Iam. 3. b.
Knowledge that breeds Variaunce and Division: but let the Eldest in the

and serve them euenso with the Food of Life / to a Nourrishing-vp of them in
the verteous Beeinge of the Love / thereafter as they are able to bear the same

8. Thus let now the Strong / infourme or traine-forward the Weak / Romans 15.
a. 1. Cor. 9. c. Gal. 6. a.
and healpe to bear their Burdens / in their Heauynes or Distress.

9. On the Goodwillingones to the Obedience of the Love / ye shall not lay

10. The Vnwillingones and Sluggish to the Obedience of the Requiringe of the
Word and his Service of Love / ye shall 1. Tess. 5. b.

in his Requiringe / is right and true: and that they euenso do humble
themselves reversed; obedientlie; with us / to the Service of the Love and his
Requiringe / unto all Concord in the Love.

12. For-that-cause / look rightly into the Requiringe of the gracious Word
of the Lord and of his Service of Love / ye Deerlie-beloued: For the
principallest that the Word and his Service of Love does first require /
Psalm. 40. a.
is the Goodwillingnes / to be obedient unto the gracious Word of the Lord /
and the Requiringe of his Service of Love. and to be turned wholly about / and

concordablie with each-other / in all Love.

13. HEerto exhort one-another of you: and let the Eldest or the Obedientest in
the Requiringe of the Word and his Service of Love / have the Fore-goinge /
for to speak with all Humility / of the Word and his Doctrine / and of the
Service of Love and his Requiringe: and so to exhort the Congregation and
himself / to ye Obedience of the Doctrine and Requiringe of the Word and his

House of God or of the Love.

16. Behold; ye Deerlie-beloued; if ye desire to growe-vpp heer-in (like-as
there is said) obedientlie / so shal-ther also then renowned Elders and Fathers
be always adjoined unto you / or ye shall have those-same continually with

Entrance into the Holy of the Sanctuary of God / before you / to the
Implantinge of you all into the gracious Word / and to all your Concord of
the Peace / in the Service of the Love: and there shall not be anything wanting
unto you / of all what is needful for you.

17. For-that-cause direct now all your Fourth-goinge / according to this
Ordinance: and apply you euenso daily / according to the Doctrine and
Requiringe of the Word and his Service of Love. Also exhort one-another to
Stilnes / and to the Uniformity of Heart / in the Love: and all that which is
