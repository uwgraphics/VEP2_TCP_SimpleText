Concerning New Wine put into old botles, or a new piece of cloth into an old
garment etc. Wherein is discribed the difference between a man changed [in
heart and nature] by the truth of Judgment [in God,] and men changing their
Judgments and opinions from one persuasion to another etc.
IN the beginning of creation, the creature was created changeable, that is in a
condition that might be changed (or subject to vanity and change) not
willingly, but by reason of him that subjected the same in hope: this condition
was not wholly subjected to the power of the enemy [without, but in the
creature,] though as a creature, he was subject to temptation and to be tempted
by the power of the Enemy (in the creaturely state of nature [in and of his
body,] and both body and spirits composure;) for yiedling or subjection was the
creatures frame (in which he had properties and qualities and faculties acting
him,) and in that was he a subject to what did or should reign over him (which
was or should be his Lord;) for the enemy could not have entered the creation
of God; out by and in him (whose place was without [the creature and creation
of God,] where he secretly and hiddenly wrought (in the mystery of darkness and
nothingness and emptiness) which made for the exalting the name and Justice of
^od (in what he was resolved to glory) over the enemy and spirit of enmity
(that wrought its own torment in the dark unconceivable womb and mystery of
eternities sufferance:)

Thus was the creature in the cause of his change, from and in the condition he
was first-placed and stated in, and had and has these conditions they bear (in
the fall from and transgression against God, ^herein the work and power of
changeablety is manifest;) And judgment was and is a condition [in the
creature] whose p^oper^y, faculty, and quality is alter^ble [to and in him] as
to a state or ^^ates he does, or may possess; And it is become an easy thing o
the creature, to change his Judgment from one thing to an (...) or from
opinions and persuasions [in the world] as the world does alter and change; but
this is but to put new wine into old botles, or a new piece of cloth into an
old garment; for the proper work of truth [in God] or God who is a spirit of
truth, is to change the heart of the man, whose nature is old, and has the
old ways and course of the enemies road to walk in, and so creat all things
new; then is the prayer and desire of the righteous and upright witnessed and
fulfilled (creat in me a clean heart O Lord! and renew a right spirit within
me;) and the heavens and earth are new created, and every and all desires of
the soul are new and after new things (even in the Lord and of his Kingdom;)
and thus may creatures and people see whether the work of the Judgment of God
has place in their hearts, and whether Judgment be so set up in the earth,
that the inhabitants may learn righteousness; for it is Gods work to Judge the
earth in righteousness, and they in whose heart the spirit of Judgment and
burning does work (to the changing it, and them in it) are such in whom God is
come to dwell, and where he sits as a refiners fire, and fullers soap, to
purefy the dross from the silver etc. in that the heart is the true seat of
judgment, and the place where the spirit of truth [in all creatures] does
Judge for God, and work its work first, before any thing can be retained that
will hold; for where truth or trueths are not held and retained in
righteousness (in the righteous part and heart,) its Judgment is against the
man (that thus treasures up or retains [in the wrong part] what works and makes
against him;) and the man cannot hold and retain it [to his lives end] in any
comfort or rejoicing [therein] that may appear, and seem to be his strength [in
Judgment,] but it breaks him, even the vessel or creature (that strengthens
Judgment against self [himself] by his thus holding and retaining it in that
part it is against him in;) for it is a very dangerous thing for the creature
to hold or retain Judgment in that which makes against him (though it be the
Judgment of the spirit of truth) in that in this day is the wrath of God
revealed from heaven against all them that hold the truth in unrighteousness,
and such are children of wrath, filled with the wrath and indignation of the
almighty God (which we were [by a nature we were born and brought forth in] as
well as others;) yea those hate the Judgment of God (that thus retain it in
the wrong mind and nature [the nature of hatred,] that is the hateful nature of
enmity against God and his good spirit of truth, which God hates, (in
referance to the enmety therein and thereof is retained against the work and
workings, and operation of such his good spirit,) where the truth is not
received in the love thereof;

And this day is God come forth to work a mighty change in the creature and
creation (the earth and world, which is the workmanship of his hands) for
behold he is creating all things new, and Ephraime is come up before his
remembrance, that has sought to rest and settle her self on the old lees and
draggs of the worlds defilements, and liberty and ease of the flesh, and all
fleshly motions and desires: and God has been emptying her from vessel to
vessel, until she is well nigh refined wine from the leese and the savor of
the old nature and vessel is well nigh lost, and the settlement left, in the
burning and inflaming body of nature [to Gods praise and glory] his Judgment
has wasted and consumed the evil in and of: Oh that there was a heart for
these things to enter! and that men would receive and lay up wise sayings! for
where truth is received in the love thereof, the Judgment of truth is seen
not to be against, but for the creature of God; and he that is in and has the
love of the Judgment of the spirit of truth posessing his heart and soul,
has the love and charity of God there, to inform the Judgment, of the work
and works of the enemy (the spirit of truth in Judgment [in God] first made
and is still bent against, for the creatures preservation out of hurt under the
power of the enemy;) and so, Judgment is kept on the work of the enemy (that
would destroy the creature or creation of God, the workmanship of his hands, in
which a sense of the love of God should remain) in this day Gods salvation and
love is sprung up to the creature and creation, which groans and waytes to be
delivered, and travils together in pain, for the adoption to wit the redemption
of the body, that the persons and spirit of creatures might be saved alive, and
as the love of God is hereby come into and dwelt in, where our brother that we
see is loved, ere God can be seen and loved and obeyed (in the heart;) what
remains but a ground for manefesting the same?

And hereby, what would lead into the work of destruction the hurt and enmity
of the creatures life, is kept out of, and not joined to [in the particular or
general] and this is the way he is leading his creature in and by, where the
work of the enemy is wearied and tired out, and the creature made weary of the
weight and burden of sin, and willing to set down and rest from his own labor
with God and so has rest and peace with ^od in the enemies destruction, he is
not joined and united to (in heart or spirit) neither has any love toward;
but hates the work and workings of the enemy and enmity [to the creatures life
and well being] with a perfect hatred (for the sake of God and his creature, in
whom the love of his truth to reign ought to be respected, for the comfort and
rejoicing of whatever God is pleased to work and act in the earth and heart of
such creatures;) for that which leads into the power of destruction, and under
its spirits guidance, does first lead and guide into destraction, whereby that
seeming zeal for God or the Lord, is for a power of dominion that is God in and
of the world of ungodly (that vallues not the creatures good and preservation
in an equal concern with the honor and glory of that God they have a zeal for,
and love to the way of;)

So who is in the love of the truth revealed in the heart, and that they know
and are acquainted with, and the Judgment thereof respects in their own
particulars, loves that which shows the evil of all biterness of spirit and
emnity against the work and will of God (in which is an equal concern of his
creatures good, in that will and work;) but the biterness of spirit it loves
not, neither the enmity to the spirit of God, which he learns (by the evil of
what he therein sees in it) to come out of, as that which is no friend to God
nor his creature; therefore should he be a friend to it, he sees he should
befriend the enemy of God and his own soul, and strengthen the enmity and
hatred of God against self himself, in countenancing or loving what God hates,
and so make the Judgment of God intolerable and hard to be born, as such work
of the enemy is pitied at home, which by loving that which discovers the evil
and danger hereof, he is thereby preserved from, and such evil and danger
prevented; and so nothing is broken and distracted o^ the work of God (in th
Judgment and understanding of the creature) neither so comes forth in the
world, through a hastiness of spirit in such the creature (in referance to self
and the selfish favor of the minds passion, in the predomenacy of any
overflowing humor;) but the heart is made new, from whence inordinacy of
passion (in such favors) do arise, and where the humors have had predomenaci,
and the cause hereof (which is the creatures destruction in the particular or
general) dies from him, and he from it: and so is in and of a healing, saving,
sound spirit, sound and wholesome in and under Judgment, being separated from
the old, and the old nature and spirit of the world, that had the old
affections, which are crucified to him, as he is to the world (in which the
inordinaci of love and affection wrought in and after earthly things;) which
should the work of the enemy be countenanced in the creature and a pity in the
heart lurk and remain to it, that may foster the evil, then is Judgment
strengthened against the creature (in that work of countenancing the enemies
power) and so becomes intolerable to the creature, and can not be born, but
leads into distraction and into a broken torn condition: but the treasure being
in heaven (where all things are new made and created) the ba^ is without holes;
for the heart is also there, and the affections set on things above; And this
is that heart and mind that what has been (empted from vessel to vessel) is
now retained in, and though it has been the cause of braking. ^in many
vessels, a heart is now felt and found that can retain the savor of its work
to its life's end; and rejoice in and speak well of the same; that like the
good householder, can bring out of its treasury things new and old; for the
heart being made new; there is daily new and fresh experience of Gods goodness;
and though old things are done away, yet the remembrance of Gods goodness and
glory (who is the worker) brings up all before the creature, to exalt the
goodness of God, and to put the creature in a daily remembrance of what he is,
as in and to himself: And here is no more sea, nor confused heaps of unstable
waters, and raging waves, that foame up and out their own shame; neither is the
broken and torn brought before God, and offered to him as a sacra^ice; Yea And
here is neither old wine in new bottles, nor new wine in old botles, whereby
the botles should break, and the wine be spilt on the ground, but new wine is
put in new botles, and both are preserved, and the garment is all new, and so
no rent (which new cloth to the old garment might make the rent worse;) but a
liquor is in the vessel, that has been powered and emptied from vessel to
vessel until all the evil savor of what was found and remains (in the first
vessel,) be l^st and consumed; and it is, though the vessels be altered, and
that is remaining, which can bear and retain the last savor and ^ast of
Judgment* oh blessed, blessed to God for ever! for thi^ is the win^ that
chea^eth the heart of God and man, it makes it glad, as we come to drink it a
new with Christ in the Kingdom of heaven.

Concerning the wedding Garment, which many in this day are found without etc.
This is the day that the light of God is arisen, and his glory does shine and
break forth in the earth and world in great luster^ through the heart and
spirit of his creature, and he that dwells in the light that no mortal eye can
approach unto (in this day Imortality and life is come to light through the
Gospel) is come down among men to tabernacle, and the spouse of the great and
mighty prince has made her self ready, the chaste wise virgin (tho bride the
lambs wife) that has joined with the spirit of God, and to it is found united
in desire, that as the spirit says come, so the bride (with the same voice)
says come; And she has the wedding garment on, the fine lining (white and
clean) which is the righteousness of the Saints, the covering of the spirit of
God; And all that are without this covering (in this day) are found naked, and
men come to see their shame; And though they are of them that may be come into
the bride chamber, yet being found, not having on the weding garment, even it
that covers and hides all the creaturely deformity and weakness and
infirmitys, they are nevertheless shut out (into utter darkness) where is
weeping and wailing, and gnashing of teeth.

A feast is prepared in this the great day of God, and proclamation thereof is
gone forth into the earth and world, yea very many has been invited thereto;
for the table God of has been spread in the wilderness, and thither has many
been alured, to a feast of fat things, of marrow, and wine from the Lees well
refined, and multitudes yea very many has fallen in this condition [by the
way] through unbeleife and unfaithfulness of heart that have been found
murmuring and repining against God, as a hard master, or hard dealer with them,
who has thereby took occasion to beat their fellow servants (themselves being
in the occasion of the hardness and of bringing thither;) but that way are they
to return which they went forth, even through sufferance to the man that has
grew up in and under the sufferance of his spirit; and the winter must be
endured and the wilderness passed through, which will try every man's works [of
what heart they are] for the first appearance of the bridegroom has been at
midnight, and the foolish Virgins as well as the wise has come forth to meet
him, and has had Lamps trimed, but no oil was therein, yea the unprepared has
had a lamp, and it was trimed, they have come into the feast (very many that
were invited,) but without a Wedding garment on, and yet room has been at the
feast, for such that are compelled to come in, and all that are not arrayed to
the content of the master of the feast are nevertheless put by shut out, and
cannot hold the trial of what is to come, but will come short of the rest
prepared for the people of God, in the flying from the one (to wit the winter)
they are found short of the benefit of both (even that which indureth the
winter, and comes to set down in and enjoy and possess the sabba^h and rest of
God)

And all them that are not come to taste of the goodness of God, that yet do
not taste and see how good he Lord is, are short of experience of the good of
these things; they taste not of the dainties of Gods house, and are not arrayed
with that which makes lovely in Gods eye, and where a condition is pleasant and
refreshable; but in that eternal eye are compreh^nded, in the state of enmity
(notwithstanding their profession;) for though a call and Proclamantion is gone
forth into the earth and world, unto the sins of men, and as many have been
invited, so very many has been comepelled to come in (in this day and hour) to
fill up the room in the house of God [that was once empty ^o gu^s^ yet here
also, even at the door or out of the house, they have (...) a repulse (in an
unprepared condition) much more in a condition altogether a stranger to these
thing, and the life of his covenant of promise how therefore does the word of
the Lord run thorugh me! prepare, prepare to meet the Lord by repentance; that
after the armor of God has been put on, and thou come to the certain sound of
the trumpet, and art prepared for the batle the whole armor of light, the
shield, of faith, the breast plate of Salvation, and helmet of righteousness,
having on thy head the crown of the victory of truth, with the loins of thy
mind girt up to God, and thou made strong in him in mind and soul, thou hereby
may be distinguished a Warrier in the army of the mighty God, and under his
banner come (which has been displayed in the sight of nations;) And having
done all, thou may be found in patience, having the garment of a meek and quiet
spirit, which with the Lord is of great price; herein God will receive thee as
a tried stone, he will meet thee here as a dove in the wilderness that wants
her mate, as a widow in the desert that has displeased the favor of her
husband; as a prodigal son, and the garment is put on, the wedding garment, the
garment of praise (in which thou may again be joined, to God (in a new and
fresh covenant;) oh this is the sum of all! the substance of all! that having
done all we may stand, stand to our own master, not think so, but be warned by
that which learns to take heed least we fall.

To be covered with righteousness is the thing, to have that over all a man's
garment, his clothing, a wedding garment and it put on; then what can harm? or
who can make afraid? To feel truth within (in the heart,) to God, to refresh
the soul, and to men to have the like mind of truth and righteousness, it is
hereby worn in the worlds sight, then is the man covered and clothed with it,
as that in the heart is brought forth into action and manifestation (when the
time comes that the exercise thereof is called for in the world;) for it is
both food and raiment; oil to the wounded, and food and raiment to the hungry
and naked, and refreshment to the weary soul; And the more is professed, the
more is required and called for (in answer to such profession) and then if
there be a stay behind the call, the voice, he is compelled to come in [very
like] to see and behold the dainties of Gods house; but he has not power to
touch thereof, much less to taste, but that is his torment, to see that which
he has no appetite to, that is not relishable to his taste And if so that is
not prepared for him nor he for it: But of this are all the upright in heart
persuaded, and that they have right to the tree of life, to the paradise of
God, to the riches and dainties of his house, notwithstanding all their
failings and backsliding which God has healed freely for his own name sake,
having him that all the treasures of knowledge and wisdom are hide in, on their
side, whom God freely gave for us all, and with him shall he not freely give us
all things; They have relish, they have taste and savor, clothed they are (on
the right hand and left) and do feel truth to be the garment and covering they
are clothed with, and it warmes them without, and refreshes them within (to
feel themselves in the life of truth professed)

Concerning the fruitless Tree that cumbers the ground etc.
The ground of this worlds essence and being (the heart thereof, that was an
honest and upright heart in Gods creation) was once good and the root of the
tree also that God once planted a truly right noble seed, and the body and
branches, that grew up from the good ground and root (as it stood good and in
innocence) in like manner was good, and brought forth the fruit of his praise
and honor, and as one man did Adam in innocence and uprightness in joy and
possess the benefit of this good (before nature degenerated into the plant of a
strange vine (then were sower grapes brought forth unto the Lord, bitter and
unpleasant to taste; the grape of Sodom and apples of Gomorah; And the servants
of the Lord were beaten and cruelly used (that were sent for the Lords own;)
for he looked for grapes, and behold vvild grapes,) and he had no benefit of
his vineyard: wherefore he began to brake off the branches, and to gather in
others, that might bring forth better fruit, and from the East and West, and
North and South, to call in and invite to come and sit down in the kingdom,
with Abraham Isaac, and Jacob, where chi dren of the kingdom are shut out, yet
were not the branches that were gathered in, to boast themselves against them
that were broken of, and cast out, but to remember and consider the root bares
them, and not them it.

And these things were seen and done in a green tree, ere the body was thorough
grown, or any thing quite ripe and dry ready for the fire (of unquenchable
burnings,) and before the fruit of such works and actions could manifest the
hidden works of darkness, and fruitlessness of what is brought forth from the
mystery of Iniquity, against which the fury of Gods soul is bent; And had he
not longed for figgs, to taste of the fruit of what his own right hand had
planted, never had the curse been felt, And it was not so much the degenerate
plant, the unpleasant tasted tree and fruit, that the curse was to, or that
drinks the dreggs of the fury of God, and his wrath and indignation to the
wicked; so is its sin strengthened (against the favor, love, and mercy of God,
that not only lets see this state, but a way to escape a further and greater
danger is made known in and by the same discovery) in reference to what is come
forth against the dry tree; for the fruit is already ripe and well nigh
gathered in, and the harvest of Gods favor (i^ the general,) near over (as to
and in many particulars, the work hereof has been manifested and witnessed
in;) therefore has this tree over stood its time, (that which has no fruit to
God in time of vintage,) and offends more then Gods Judgment; for his favor
and grace is hereby so abused and sinned against, that its well nigh wearied
out (as his Judgment had been offended wh^^ sower grapes were brought forth;)
this God bore for thy sake, hi^ creature, and for thy weakness sake and want of
knowledge (of his mind and will, and the counselings of his pure spirits work
and workings;) because his servants were not altogether sent away empty, but
brought unto him such as the ground bore; but where the servants of the Lord,
and last of all the son himself, has been sent away without fruit, and evilly
entreated, and violent hands laid on them and the heir not owned to be Lord of
and ever the inheritance, the provocation is aggravated and the man's
condemnation the more just, in the wilful dispite of and against the spirit of
grace, and for his own name sake is he thus arisen, that he may get himself a
name and a praise (in the salvation or destruction of such he comes to plead
with (in mercy and the free grace of his love,) wherein he begins as an enemy
and as submition is found and witnessed (under Judgment) friendship and unity
is witnessed, and the breach made up and all still and quiet. Yea and was it
not a favor in God to bear with this tree beyond the time of his first
gathering (the time that Judgment was due to it, and that God came forth in
the Judgment of and against his creature, in a state he is fallen in and
under?) that passing by he should find it cumbring the ground, and have no
fruit to his praise or any thing from thence brought forth pleasant to his
taste and is it not the favor, grace, and mercy of God, is the ground of thy
being, and if it be not of thy well being; is it not because of thy sin and
offense against it? for there was goodness in God in his forbearance, and
bearing with thee to this day, but if he can have no more good from and in thee
thereby, say not he has dealt hardly in this kind; for on Gods part there is
goodness in the ground of thy being (which honoreth his forbearance) and if it
be not answered on thy part; this is the continual voice and cry of God in that
soul that which is good is cumbered, the field is over grown with weeds (netles
and briars and thorns, and these choke the good seed:) but when the ground is
seen bad; either highway ground, or stony; or thorny its nigh unto cursing,
whose end is to be burnt; and this is a very sad state, where mercy and favor
has left man to the second death of Judgments decreeing, and that bears with
the man, waiting to honor and get God a name in its execution; therefore ought
the furrow ground to be ploughed up and no more to sow among thorns.

So this tree is that the man that has been sown to (that which is of the
flesh being flesh, as that which is of the spirit is spirit;) which man lives
in and reaps and injoyes that which he has been sown to and in, and if it be
of the flesh, of the flesh it reapes corruption; for the works of each body and
spirit is ripe for trial and to receive Judgment is ready, which must be born
by, and rest and end on the transgressor; (though it has begun or may begin on
the creature of God;) And though the works of many does suffer loss in this
particular, yet so as their persons shall be saved alive, in this day of the
Lord Jesus; but where Judgment goes against the body, the tree or man; if the
creature be not dead to it, and it to him, how hard is it to be born? And the
more just judgment is, the more painful is it to be born by a life in the
creature.

So this is the sum of what has been said, what fruit was brought forth to
God (before his truth was professed) was in a green tree and then was the wild
olive standing, and the wild vine and grapes was brought forth, and as their
Judgment was without and in the first man, they have found hard measure, and
were beaten with a few stripes (that which was under the Law and had its
measure from men without mercy,) in a time of profession, there Judgment is
only with the Lord, and their fruit called for etc. (Though such has been and
are beaten with a few stripes, and has the like measure meated from God, as
they have measured to him [in his requirings of their duty to his creature,]
and do taste of the bitter things of his house, as he has tasted of their
bitter fruit,) as the fruitless and barren tree, that has worren out the
patience and forbearance of God, and has drawn forth the strength of the root
into a bare and mere show and profession, flourishing with leaves only, but
has no fruit of that which it makes a show of and professes in the world;
This is it that has a curse at its root; which the Axe of God is laid to,
whereas under the law, when the fruit was only sower and unpleasant, bitter to
the taste of God, and unsavory in the nostriles of the holy one (when as in a
sensure, it was offered to him as insence,) the axe was only laid to the
branches, to the bodies spreading forth; but now cut it down says the Lord,
why cumbers it the ground? Oh that this could be read! for great is the work of
God, in revealing the mystery hereof in this day;

For it is this tree God is displeased with (in the biterness of his soul) that
has not the nature and virtue and sap of the life it makes show of and
professes (to and in the worlds eye and sight,) whereby the name of God is
blasphemed and spoken evil of by and through them; that have been branching
forth themselves into several Judgments and persuasions of opinion, and the
strength of all they labor and endeavor after is but to make a fair show in
the flesh, and to insult over such they have power over in this particular* and
so is fit for naught, but the fire: for the sower grapes though they were
unpleasant to Gods taste (such that our fathers or father eat of this tree) and
the childrens teeth has thereby been set an edge, whereby the ^nger of what
was raised and kindled, has discovered Gods countenance (not to be his wounted
favor and way and course of doing good) whereby the sons of men have seen
themselves threatened, with the displeasure of God, that which was thus
unpleasant to his relish; yet shall this proverb no more be used in our Land
(the fathers have eaten sower grapes and the childrens teeth are set on edge
etc;) but as what was done in a green tree has been favorably dealt with, and
the branches thereof only cropped, and taken away, as a time of ignorance God
winked at much of these things, and chastised them with rods only but now with
Scorpions; then with a few stripes, but now with many (and concerning this
says my soul, oh that the states hereof could be distinguished of in the world)

Concerning the words of Christ, fear not him that can kill the body; but fear
ye him that is able to destroy both body and soul, and cast it into hell fire:
Intorduct, Because the Judgment of God is eternal, and the fire is
everlasting into whose burning flames the wicked is and are to be cast, it has
become a common proverb in the world, that out of hell is no redemption; though
there may be and are many already in it that thus are useing and exclaiming
this message unto others: and that both such and all others may have a care for
the future, what they say and pronounce in such cases; I proceed to declare:

First, What hell is? And who those are that already are in it?

Hell is utter darkness, and its fire is the unquenchable fury of the wrath of
Gods judgment, in the torment of the wicked: but though it be so to a nature
and state the creature mankind, was once fallen into and under, yet it is not
absolutely so to the creature of God, in any state he has been betrayed into,
and has so fallen in and under: for there is a great deal of difference
between the man of sin and worker of inequity (the enemy of mankind under whose
power the creature of God has fallen,) and the creature it self thus betrayed
(by the subtle alurements and temptation of the serpent, and Satan, that old
deceiver of mankind;) Yea and the creature of God shall be redeemed and
restored in all the world, into that state of liberty, and under that
subjection God first placed and stated him in, and though God created all
things for himself, and the wicked for the day of destruction: yet did not God
create them wicked, but that state they were lead into, under the power of the
destroyer, that thereby has deceived the creature of that peace and comfort in
the world, that stands in time and place, that otherwise was therein peculiar
to him, and that he might have enjoyed (whose such day of destruction he the
destroyer called to himself,) though the day God created: even this day that
manifests the destroyer and power of destruction, that God in eternity and
his equal decreeings (that measures to every one and thing a just recompense of
reward) had ordained and measures back to him, and on his own head, what he
thus awakened to the creature (that is now returned to and on himself;)
Therefore,

Such are already in hell,

Who are not or has not been brought down into a sense and filling of the
creatures misery (under the power of the destroyer and devourer;) for thither
was Christ Jesus (the lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world, that
was made sin for us, though he knew no sin in himself, but took on him the
infirmities of nature, sin was the cause of, and suffered the curse of the Law
due to sin, and that was added because of sin and transgression against God)
brought, and he endured the shameful cursed death of the Cross, to teach and
lead the creature of God what he was to wait in, to feel the power of, to the
overcoming the curse; for it was written in the Law cursed was every one that
hanged on a tree; and this curse came on the transgressor first and was added
because of transgression, and a sense and feeling of this condition are all to
come into for the creatures sake, ere the transgression can be removed, and he
that is really the transgressor brought to judgment and condign punishment;
for though the woman the creature of God, was first found in transgression
(that was created for the man,) and the man in this state is by the woman, yet
the man of sin, that man by whom sin came, was the cause of and in the ground
of her betraying (who was created to be the man's glory [in this fallen state]
as he was created to be the glory or Image of God.) And it is he that was in
the cause of and rejoices in the creatures fall and destruction (that was not
nor is not Gods creature) that God will destroy by his coming, in the
brightness of his appearance, and by the breath of his mouth and nostriles: And

Thus are all to consider, the man is but one [that has soul and body] and the
way of God is but one, and the fire of Gods eternal Judgment (that is fury and
wrath to the wicked) is but one; and this fire is the curse and pain of death
(the torment thereof is,) that which the enemy kindled and awakened under the
sufferance of God (wherein God is called and termed a consuming fire;) Yea and
this fire is to be endured [by all,] that he may be known that can endure
everlasting burnings, and can dwell with and in consuming fire (where God is
come to sit [in his people] as a refiner;) But though the creature was once
found in transgression the first man Adam was; And though the curse of the Law
of men rested and rests on the just and innocent, yet the judgment of God
has begun at the house of God (where the Judgment of men and curse of their
Law has rested;) And into this sense and feeling, even of sufferance with the
just, and to the bearing the wait and burden of and on the creature and
creation of God, are all to come; for there is Christ Jesus the just, this
suffering seed and spirit of God; and whoever feels or has a sense of him,
has that sense first raised of him in a suffering condition, and comes to
suffer with him; as did David, that came the right way to God, and felt him in
the seed and spirit of life in a suffering condition, and for that cause was
his soul in hell or grave (under the power of the enemies work, first awakened
temptation to that, which being overcome by [as Gods witness was and is
awakened in the soul] the torment of fear and terror [of and in death,] made
him cry out under, my sins are a burden to heavy for me to bear;) and whether
shall I sly from thy presence, If I go into hell thou art there, and in the
bottom of the Sea also, for mighty waves had went over his soul, and he saw the
grave of the wicked, and the place of the ungodly (where they dwell that are
set in slipery places;) but he was assured, that God would not leave his soul
there (in hell or the grave,) nor suffer his holy one to see corruption; for
the Lord said unto my Lord said he, sit thou at my right hand, until I make
thy foes my footstool; so

The dwelling and keeping in a sense and feeling of that state and condition
the creature or creation of God is in all the world, is to be in the way and
hope of the redemption of God, and to have the faith of God [in his son]
concerning the work of restoration; for it is the misery and sad state of the
world, that they are unsenceable of their misery, and the sadness of that state
they are in and under; and therefore is it the house of darkness, and utter
darkness will be their portion; if they come not this way, even to that which
awakeneth the sense of sin, and of the creatures misery therein and under; for
in that state of darkness and blindness of mind, eternity and endless
separation steals on the creature, and he slips into the pit and ditch out of
which is no recovery; And this is to have soul and body cast into hell fire,
when in the body of nature a fire is kindled, and wrath come forth, in
referance to the power of the enemy and destruction the creature in that state
has favored, and wherein the humors of the mind has lodged, that leads into
and creates humors of body favorable to deaths power and dominion^ yet I would
not have it concluded that the just seed of God and spirit of life in the
creature and creation, or the creature it self, is always to continue in and
under susferance in the world, though wh^le the world is in this state and
condition things now standing in and under, needs must the sufferance thereof
continue; And the creature is not to go out of the sense and feeling of the
state and condition the Justice is in, in the general, into hardness of
Judgment against the creature of God in the world, because of any experience
of deliverance in the particular, out of such state the generality of people
lays in and under, and so in that hard mind and state, to close up themselves
against mercy, and pity, and limit God to the will of any creaturely
Judgment; for the sufferance of and in the body of nature (in the state things
now stand in and under) cannot for ever continue to and in the creature of God,
but drives it to its eternal home (which rules in and over the world, and is
God in the spirit of the world) to the setting the creature of God at liberty
(that has been in bondaged under the power hereof.)

The Difference between the creatures Sinning against the Judgment of God [in
a time of ignorance, before God was known and acquainted with,] and against his
mercy and grace, after he has made known and revealed himself in his presence
(of joy, favor, and loving kindness.)
Which is A precious warning and visitation (of repentance) to all the world;
but especially to thee (O England!)

Oh World! World! and in thee (O England!) this is not so much a threatening
thee with what is to come to pass as a warning and visitation (of information)
for the turning your minds to the light of Christ and spirit of God (in your
hearts,) that you may see (from the King on the throne, to the maid that
grindes on the mill or bagger on the dunghill,) that God is no respector of
persons but is this day come down into the earth to visit for the sins of all
(high and low rich and poor and none shall go free and escape the hand of his
Judgment herein,) for your sins are ripe and ready for destruction.

And this day is your sin and offense against the spirit of God (or God who is
a Spirit) aggravated against him; in that it is now against his mercy and the
love of his pity and free grace (ye are thus found sinning and offending
against him,) from the head to the foot, and so throughout the whole body of
nature [in creation] wherein the favor and forgiveness of God has been much
wronged and abused (by their slighting the sa^^^) which in days of old was
only against the Judgment of God, and that in a time of Ignorance (Wherein the
creature knew not God, nor his Judgments the sin and offense was against,)
which caused God the more to wink at their faults, and to correct them lightly
[with rods,] for that they knew not him, nor the mind and will of his spirit
[in judgment,] that the sin and offense was thus to and against, though
sufferance and afflictions followed such the creature [for his evil,] but it
was good from God (thus to follow with judgment) that the creature might
thereby come to see his sin, and him that he thus had sinned and offended
against, and learn good under the same, to mourn for him he thus had sinned and
offended against [in a time of ignorance,] and this was a time of trial [of his
patience] though he suffered for evil doing, where stooping under the Judgment
or Judgments of God, he thereby came to learn wisdom of him to know his
spirits counsellings; even the counsellings of his law (which is light in the
heart or conscience;) for before I was aflicted (said David) I went astray, but
now I have learned thy Law, and thy Law is light etc. And oh how I love thy Law
(and the judgments and statutes thereof; that are sweeter to me then the honey
and honey combe^)

Thus was Judgment the creatures teacher and instructor (in a state under the
Law, whereby came up the prophecy or sight of a better and more acceptable day
and state of the love of God) and this has been loved, even the Judgments of
God (to and on a state as it was and is due to,) how has the creature been
kept low under judgment (in a state of fear and trembling?) and the love of
God hereby has come to grow and increase in the heart; and so that which first
appeared in the judgment turned into mercy and love, and is the free grace of
God (to and in his creature) for the first discovery of God [is] in judgment
(to a state in the creature it is due to;) and as that is kept to at home, and
the creaturely will and strivings, and struglings watched over, a short work is
made in the Earth (in what stoopes to judgment [in God] and to be counseled
by his spi^i^,) and that's become the mercy love and free grace of God to such
his creature, i^ the loving receiving thereof) that first appeared in judgment
(in which anger and fury and wrath began to be kindled to and in his creature,
and accordingly is measured back (in what is broke forth in and on the world,)
but if the creature go on in sin and offense against this the judgment of G^^
(though in the execution thereof sufferance has pursued him therein,) and a
stop was put to his way and course so that he could not any longer go on
therein, but was forced to stoop thereto (because his way was hedged up with
thorns) yet as sufferance [under Judgment,] any white stayed and rested, has
taken occasion thereby to strengthen himself in sin and offense against the
same (oh this is against the mercy, and favor, and love of God!) And it
becomes much worse, and the offense of greater (thus to sin against the favor
and grace of God [in love, mercy, pity and compassion to his creature) then the
sin and offense merely against the Judgment of God (in the creatures
ignorance, that knew not him (in the mind and will thereof,) that the sin and
offense was against;) which as it is thus aggravated by what has abounded,
strengthens the Judgment of God against his creature (that was at first
ordained against the sin the creature was overcome and overpowered by (in which
state God reckoned him not for the sinner) but chastised him lightly and with a
few stripes, to bring and lead him to the sense he first departed from,) that
now is chastised with scorpions and beaten with many stripes; Yea my heart
bleeds in the consideration of thy offense (oh England!) in this particular,
and let it be read both by King and People, Rulers, and Subjects (in that I am
in good earnest with ye all) that no longer shall your trials be played and
sported with; for God will not be mocked (any longer by ye.

Oh Consider, consider! your sin against his mercy, and favor, and gentle
dealings, is a great aggravation of your offense, and makes it intolerable:
What shall I say to ye? Or what shall I do for ye (that weary out the patience
and long sufferance of God?) I have taken up a complaint, I mourn bitterly and
sorely what grief is like my grief herein? will ye provoke God (as a man
provokes his enemy and adversary,) and is it possible he should always bear? O
weep, repent and howl bitterly ye adulterors and adulteresses (that have
back-slided from God, and his Judgments, Laws and statutes;) for ye all are
gone astray, and are an adulterous generation; will ye always offend his
patience (as a wicked man that tryes and strains the patience of his friend;)
and is it possible God should always bear with ye? will ye strive to strain the
Patience of God beyond its bent (because he has been long suffering and
forbearing;) and think ye he will not be too strong for ye?

For as a man should not streign the courtesy of his friend (to the end of
forbearance; or beyond the freedom thereof) to make him his enemy; and as he
should not provoke and stir up evil toward himself, and cause his own hurt and
destruction; so will not the Lord always hold him guiltless (in the nature
hereof;) oh, is not! and has it not been (the love of God) in the time of thy
ignorance and want of knowledge of him, to put a stop to thy ways and course
(as a stop to the way and course of a menstrous Woman, as a hedge to the path
of a whore and adultress from her husband,) when the Prince of the power of
darkness had blinded thy eye (the god of this World that rules in the children
of disobedience) and the blind were leading the blind (until both were ready to
fall and tumble in the ditch? was it not his large favor to thee his creature
(while in a state of enmity against his spirit, and under the power and leading
and guideance of the enemies,) to let thee see thy state? and has not the
grace and favor and love and mercy [of God] appeared and brok forth in the
World? and does it not shine in his forbearance to and of his creature? Oh! lay
down, lay down stoop and give place! cry in secret, for God has overtook thee
(oh perverse people!) And his grace is become their teacher of all them (that
live godly, righteously, and soberly in this present evil world,) that denying
ungodliness and worldly lust, they should so live and behave themselves, as
answer his witness in all hearts and not acquit God evil for his kindness, and
provoke his jealousy, which is over them for good,) against them for evil; but
(as becomes Christians) should be armed with the same mind as was him they
profess.

Therefore let the mind and heart of all that God has overtaken be awakened;
see oh see against whom and what, ye have wounded, and pierced, and greeved,
and return to him in that spirit that bears the weight and burden of all on
his shoulders: That ye may come to the repentance not to be repented of, in the
godly sorrow of heart, where sin goes before hand to Judgment, and may no
longer continue in the daily and hourly repentings of the World, nor worldly
sorrow of men of corrupt minds, that sin wilfully after the knowledge of Gods
truth has been received in the heart, (and there has been a tasting of the
good gifts of God and the power of the world to come, and there remaining
nothing but a fearful looking for of Judgment;) for that day had not come if
there had not been first a falling away, and departing from the truth;
therefore must Judgment be stooped to and born and endured (on that mind and
nature) in that the repentings of the world (in the worldly mind and nature,)
will not serve turn, will not renew to go they are ever to be repented of; and
though it may not be wilfully and in dispite to the spirit of grace (that all
such sinnings are in and stands in the mind of,) yet they lead it to (in whom
ever sins after the knowledge of truth is received where the sin comes after to
Judgment, and men dies in their sin, then whether he goes [that forgiveth
sin] they cannot come; so to live in a state where is the after Judgment, and
after repentings (of the world,) is to live in a fearful troubled state and
condition there remaining nothing but a fearful looking for of Judgment, and
fiery indignation from Heaven.

Oh! I warn all people on the earth, never for time to come to charge any
hardness on God, or that he is a hard master, etc. But keep that on self, that
the creature of God may feel his love (whom his love is to) and may grow up in
and under the same; for whatever is done from and in that hard and hardened
spirit [against the creature of God,] in the name of God, is thereby the more
aggravated against God.

THE END.
