A Proclamation for the apprehension of Walter Long, Esquire, and William
Strode, Gentleman.
WHereas by Our special Command, the Lords, and others of Our Privy Council,
have by several Orders of that Board directed and Commanded, that Walter Long,
Esquire, late high Sheriff of the County of Wiltshire, and William Strode,
Gentleman, son of Sir William Strode, of the County of Deuon, Knight, for
seditious practices and crimes of a high nature, committed by them against Us,
should be apprehended and brought before them, to answer for the said
offenses; but the Messengers of Our Chamber, employed in that Service, having
used much diligence for their apprehension, have returned in vain, and neither
of them are yet apprehended, nor have yielded themselves, as in duty they
ought to have done; But have withdrawn and hid themselves in such manner, as
that the Messengers cannot find them out. We therefore, by the advice of Our
Privy Council, have thought fit, by this Our public Proclamation, to
declare Our Royal pleasure and Command; That the said Walter Long, and William
Strode, and either of them, do forthwith render themselves to the Lords of
Our Privy Council, before them to answer for their said offenses: To which,
if they shall not presently yield obedience; We do further straightly Charge
and Command all and every Our Justices of Peace, Majors, Sheriffs, Constables,
and other Our Officers, Ministers, and loving Subjects, That they, and every of
them, do use all diligence to apprehend them, and either of them, and being
apprehended, to bring them immediately before Our Privy Council, there to
answer unto such matters, as on Our hehalfe shall be objected against them,
and either of them. And Our further Command is, that in the mean time none
presume to receive, harbor, or entertain the said Walter Long, and William
Strode, or either of them, upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such further
punishment, as shall be just for so high a Contempt.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the seven and twentieth day of March, in the
Fifth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.
