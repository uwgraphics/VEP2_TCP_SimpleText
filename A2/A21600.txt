A Decree of the Priuye Counsel at westminster. Anno. 1.5.5.9. xx. October
Articles agreed upon by the Lords and other of the Queen's Majesty's pryuy
Counsel, for a reformation of their servants in certain abuses of apparel
thereby to give example to alother Lords, noble men and Gentlemen.
EVery Lord and Master having servants, shall furthwith cause a view to be
taken of al his servants, attending about the City, and considre their
degres and habilities of living, how many may dispende and be assessed to the
Subsedie at. xx. pound of yearly lyuelyhode, or at two hundrede pound in
goods, and thereupon cause them to understand what is laweful for them to
wear in their apparel, and take order to reform it, in this manner or such
like.

First as many as have any apparel unlawful for them to wear, and can
without there loss leave the same, to leave it furthwith, and to be strayghtly
charged that they procure no new.

NExt that sum mete persons be assigned by the Master, to take a certain
view of all the servants present apparel, being unlawful, and make a
certain book thereof, and thereupon give commandment that no new be bought
or worn after the said view taken.

THyrdly these books shall be delivered either into the countinge house, or to
the gentlemen huyshers, there to remain, to thend that if any shall be empeched
for wearyng of any unlawful apparel, that then the same might be tried
whether it were newely provided since the view taken or no.

ITem, order shall be taken and charge given by the Lords and Masters, that
upon this reformation the mallycyous invention and froward nature of any
servants, shall not deuyse any new fashion, or sort of apparel, that
should be as sumptuous as the former, though not contrary to the words of the
statute, thereby sekyng by fraud to avoid the pain of the law, with which
perverse condition the wisdom of the Masters must mete. both to chastyse
such lewd servants, and to confort such aswyllyue in order and honest and
cumlye manner.

ANd because many Gentlemen and servants, have at this present, sum by
gifts, some otherwise, furs, embrodiries, and other garments, or
ornaments, contrary to the laws of the Realm. It is convenient that every
person having such being not well hable to change the same. But meaning
hereafter to observe the law and not be empeched for his default herein, shall
deliver a true certificate signed with his hand, of all such his apparel as is
not lawefull for his degree to the Lord Chamberlayne of the Queen's Majesty's
householde, if he mean to wear the same apparel in any the Queen's
Majesty's Chambers, or to the comptynge house, if he mean to wear thee same,
within the gates of the Court. So as for the time such persons as were their
former unlawful apparel may be forborne and spared.

ANd it seems not unmeet to refrain the conetuouse lewd condition of the
Tailors, and hosyers, that every Lord ^^^ Mays^^^ ^^ther by himself, or some
his principal officers prescrybe to all manner of his servants, that none of
them ex^^^e sum convenient and reasonable price for their garments, and
specially for their hose, wherein a diversity would be had between them which
be hable, and so assessed in Subsedye, either at xx. pound yearly lively hode,
or two hundred pound in goods, and all others that be not. And yet
notwithstanding that all this travail is to be taken for reformation of the
shameful excess of Apparel, as thoccasion of diverse of poverty, in
others, of robberies and such like. Yet it is mete and conueniente that all
Lords servants (specially in the Court) should go semely and cumly for the
honor of their Master, which may be well done, wearynge the commodities of
this Realm, and vsyng measure in all shape and form of apparel.

God save the Queen.
