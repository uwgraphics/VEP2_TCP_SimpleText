Printed at LONDON for NICHOLAS BOVRNE. 1628.

TO THE HONORABLE THE HOUSE OF COMMONS assembled in PARLIAMENT. The humble
Petition of the Governor and Company of Merchants of London Trading to the East
Indies.
Humbly showing;
THat whereas by the special industry and great Charges of diverse Merchants of
London and others of his Majesty's Subjects, the Trade to the East Indies was
begun now twenty eight years past, and has been ever since continued by a
Company of all degrees of persons in this Kingdom, incorporated under the
royal Charters of the late Queen Elizabeth and King James of blessed memory:
which have been since ratified and confirmed by the Kings most excellent
Majesty that now is, with such privileges and immunities, as are therein at
large contained; whereby many and sundry Voyages have been performed into
those remote Countries with good success and great gain, until of late
years some evil Encounters, not only of the Seas and enemies, but more
especially the undue proceedings and actions of our professed friends and
Allies, have infinitely damnified the said Traffic, which otherwise might
have prospered and grown much better: even as it is by time and industry
greatly enlarged and discovered for a more ample Vent and Consumption of our
Cloth, and other our native Commodities; Nevertheless, the afore-written
disasters, and the carring of foreign Coins out of this Kingdom into the
Indies, have begot such causeless Complaints in the mouths of many his
Majesty's Subjects of all degrees and in all places of the Realm, that the
Adventurers are thereby much discouraged to Trade any longer under the evil
censure of the multitude, desiring nothing more then to obtain their private
wealth, with the public good,

Therefore the petitioners humbly pray this Honorable House to take the annexed
Articles (or any others) into your most grave and wise consideration, that so
if upon the due examination of the same, the said trade be found unprofitable
to the Commonwealth, it may be SVPPRESSED. And if otherwise, that then it may
be SVPPORTED AND COVNTENANCED BY SOME PVBLIQVE DECLARATION for the satisfaction
of all his Majesty's Subjects, and better encouragement of the present
Adventurers, or any others, who thereby might be the more forward and willing
to adventure their Estates in a business of such consequence, when they shall
know that it has obtained such great and honorable approbation.

Queres upon the Trade to the East Indies.
Strength WHether it does not much increase the strength of this Kingdom with
Mariners, Warlike-Shipping, Ammunition, and all necessary Arts-men thereunto
belonging. Whether it does not greatly increase the general traffic of this
Kingdom, not only as it is a very ample trade of it self, between England
and the Indies, but also as it is an ample Staple or Magazine of many rich
Indian wares, to send from hence into other foreign Countries.
Wealth Whether it does not increase the general Stock and wealth of the
Kingdom. Whether it be not a means to save the particular Subjects much money
yearly in their ordinary expenses upon all the sorts of Indian wares. Whether
it does not much increase his Majesty's Customs and Imposts in the yearly
revenue. Whether it be not a good means to improve the price of Lands, Woolls,
Tynn, Iron, Lead, and other the Native commodities of this Kingdom. Whether
the King and the Kingdom (also) have not gotten much by this Trade even in
these late disasterous times, when the Ad-venturers have lost great matters.
Safety Whether it be not a means greatly to weaken the KING of SPAIN and
his Subjects, and to exhaust their Treasure. Whether it be not a means to
counterpoize the HOLLANDERS swelling greatness by trade, and to keep them from
being absolute Lords of the Seas, if they may drive us out of this rich
traffic, as they have long endeavored to perform both by policy and force.
Treasure Whether it be not the best means we have to increase the Treasure
or Money of this Kingdom.
Honor Whether it be not an honor suitable to the Majesty of so great a King
and Kingdom.

THE HVMBLE REMONSTRANCE OF THOSE REASONS which the Governor and Company of
Merchants of London trading to the East India do make upon the Queres that are
annexed unto their Petition, exhibited unto the Honorable House of COMMONS
assembled in PARLIAMENT.
And First; Strength
Whether it does not greatly increase the general Traffic of the Kingdom,
not only as it is a very ample Trade of it self between England and the
Indies; but also as it is an ample Staple or Magazine of many rich Indian wares
to send from hence into other foreign Countries.

THE Trade to the East Indies some few years past did employ fifteen thousand
tunns of Shipping all at once, either going or coming, or Trading there from
Port to Port; but since (upon good experience) we find that so great a Charge
is neither necessary for our defense; nor comportable by the benefit of the
Traffic, until some further Discoueries may be made in China, or elsewhere,
as is hoped: Nevertheless (according to the present times) there is and may be
employed and maintained tenn thousand tunns of great and warlike Shipping,
besides three thousand tunns more now here in the Kingdom repayring for the
next Supply of those Voyages.

THe said Shipping do employ two thousand and five hundred Mariners, whereof
one third part at least are shipped from hence Land-men, or such as were not
formerly used to the Seas, but are bred and made good Mariners by these
Voyages, which otherwise at home (being without Arts or maintenance) are a
heavy burden to their friends and Country.

THis Trade as it is thus great in it self; so does it yet further enlarge our
Traffic and strength, by furnishing this Kingdom with all sorts of Indian
wares, not only for our own use, but more especially for the necessary wants
of foreign Nations, which has greatly increased the number of our Warlike
Ships, to export them from hence into Turkey, Italy, the East Countries, and
other places: For proof whereof we instance the last year when we brought
in Pepper from the Indies to the value of two hundred and eight thousand pounds
sterling, whereof one hundred and fourscore thousand pounds was within few
weeks after Shipped, or sold to be transported into foreign Countries: the
like is done with Indico, either in the same kind it is brought in, or else
after we have gotten the benefit of the manufacture in the dye of our Clothes,
and so likewise of Callicoes and diverse other rich Wares; in so much that we
may boldly affirm, that by these exportations as from a Staple Magazine of
Indian Commodities for diverse parts of Christendom and Turkey, we do employ
going and coming in those Voyages at least two thousand tunns of Shipping,
which do require five hundred Mariners to man them.

THe Arts and handicrafts-men, which appertain unto the building and repayring
of all the said Shipping, together with the making of Ordnance, Muskets, Shot,
Powder, Swords, Pikes, Cordage, Canvas, and many other necessary Ammunitions
and provisions thereunto belonging, made here in the Kingdom, does not employ
less then one thousand men of diverse trades.

SO that the whole strength by this Trade to the East Indies, The whole
strength by the East India Trade.
is the continual employment of twelve thousand tunns of Warlike Shipping, and
four thousand Mariners and Arts-men more then in the times before this Trade
begun, which is a great addition of power to the Kingdom.

But if any man object and say, Answer to diverse Objections.
that heretofore we employed three or four hundred tunns of Shipping yearly
into Turkey, to lade Spice and Indico, which Trade is now utterly lost, because
those Commodities are now brought us directly from the Indies; the answer is,
that in the times when we were served with the said Wares from Turkey, the
importation was but small, because the prizes then were dear; so that we may
well counterpoize the loss of that employment of Shipping with as much or more
tunnage now set on work to fetch Timber, Plancke, Pipe-Staues, and Timber
knees out of Ireland, and Hemp out of East land to make our Cordage for the
furnishing of so many great Ships as we now employ to the Indies, and also
for the bringing in of Wines, Elephants teeth, wrought Silks, Corrall,
Quicke-Siluer, and other foreign Wares, to furnish out those Voyages.

ANd if it be further objected, that this great increase of Shipping which is
here declared, is not always in the Kingdom upon occasion of service, the
answer is. That neither are the Ships of any other Merchants here at home,
but some are going, some are coming, and ever the least part are in the
Kingdom; yet still wheresoever they are, his Majesty's Subjects have by them
their employment and maintenance, and the Kingdom as well as the East India
Company have had their service: For how famous are their exploits to all
Nations? how many rich Carracks have they suncke and spoiled? how many assaults
of Spanish Gallions have they withstood and foiled? What slaughter of their
Soldiers, sack of their Towns, subversion of their trades, and such like
honorable actions have they performed? and all with little loss of Ships or
men. It would require a large discourse, to declare the particulars: Neither
does the East India Company commonly want three thousand Tunns of shipping or
more here in the Kingdom, which are either in building or repayring, together
with all their Ordnance and other Warlike furniture, besides their Storehouses
and Dockyards plentifully provided with Timber, Plancke, Cordage, Powder, Shot,
and many other necessary Ammunitions both for themselves, and oftentimes to
help others with such provisions as cannot elsewhere be found for money in
this Kingdom, especially Gunpowder, whereof they have a good quantity now in
store, and do make weekly about thirty barrels at their own powder Mills,
of such refined Salt Peeter, as they bring from the Indies in their shipping.

THere is yet one common Objection, but it is so weak that it scarce deserves
an answer, which is, that this East India Trade destroys our Shipping and
Mariners, when clean contrary to this we have already showed the great
increase of both; and if men dye in these long voyages, and Ships by length of
time be laid up, either here or in the Indies, yet what is all this but natures
course; and that which happens here at home in our nearest Trades, although
with far less noise and notice? How many brave Commanders have we bred from
mean degree? (whereof diverse are still in our service,) some at this present
are found worthy the best places in his Majesty's Navy, many of our ordinary
men have lately lost their lives for their country, and others (being grown
rich) do either keep at home or follow shorter voyages, but leaving these
advantages we do answer all with this, that whatsoever is pretended in the
decay of shipping or death of men, yet not withstanding the Kingdom, by this
trade has obtained no less increase or clear addition both of the one and
the other, which continually subsist and are in action, then is before declared.

Whether it does not increase the general stock and wealth of the Kingdom.
Whether it be not a means to save the particular Subjects much money yearly
in their ordinary expenses upon all sorts of Indian wares. Whether it does not
much increase his Majesty's Customs and Imposts in the yearly revenue. Whether
it be not a good means to improve the price of Lands, Woolls, Tynn, Iron,
Lead, Wealth
and other the native commodities of this Kingdom. Whether the King and the
Kingdom (also) have not gotten much by this Trade, even in these late
disasterous times, when the Adventurers have lost great matters.

HEre we have five Queres which must be all proved severally, the first is
general, wherein we must consider how the whole Kingdom may be enriched by
our Commerce with Strangers, the which to perform, although it has one and
the same rule in all the particular places of the Trade; The places of our
remotest traffic are most profitable to the Commonwealth.
yet is not every Country alike profitable to this Commonwealth, For the
remotest traffic is always most beneficial to the public Stock, the
example may be framed thus. Suppose we therefore, that Pepper were constantly
worth two shillings the pound here in England, if we should then fetch the same
from Holland the Merchant may pay there to the Stranger twenty pence the pound
out of this Kingdoms Stock, and gain well by the bargain, but if he fetch
this Pepper from the East Indies, he cannot give there above five pence the
pound at the most to obtain the like gain, when all charges are considered;
which does sufficiently show the great advantage we have to buy our Wares in
those remote Countries, not only for that part alone which we spend and
consume, but especially for that great quantity which from hence we transport
yearly into other Countries to be sold at higher price then it is worth here
in England; Whereby it is plain, We may grow rich in Trade by the Stock of
other Nations.
that we make a far greater Stock by gain upon these Indian Commodities,
then those Nations do where they grow; and to whom they properly appertain,
as being the natural wealth of their Countries: Neither is there less honor
and judgment by getting riches in this manner, upon the Stock of other
Nations, then by an industrious increase of our own means, especially when
this latter is advanced by the benefit of the former, Cloth, Lead, and Tynn,
vented in the East Indies.
as we have found in the East Indies by sale of much of our Tynn, Cloth, Lead,
and other native Commodities, the vent whereof does daily increase in those
Countries, which formerly had no use of our Wares, but for the better
understanding of that which has been said, A distinction between the gain
of the Kingdom, and the profit of the Merchant.
we must not forget to distinguish between the gain of the Kingdom and the
profit of the Merchant. For although the Kingdom pay no more for this Pepper
then is before supposed, nor for any other Commodity bought in foreign
parts, more then the Stranger receives from us for the same; Yet the Merchant
pays not only that price, but also the freight, ensurance, interest,
Custom, impost, and many other charges which are exceeding great in these long
Voyages; but yet all these in the Kingdoms account are but commutations among
ourselves, and no privation of the public Stock, they remain still in the
Kingdom.

NOw concerning that which every particular Subject of the Realm saves in his
ordinary expense of Indian Wares, it is manifest that heretofore when we
brought Indico from Turkey, that sort was ordinarily sold here for six
shillings the pound or more, which now we fell for four shillings the pound
and under, Pepper then ordinarily at three shillings and three shillings four
pence the pound, The Hollanders ingrosing of Cloves, Maces, and Nutmegs, have
made them exceeding dear.
which now is sold by the East India Company for twenty pence the pound, with
long time also given therewith for payment, and so likewise of diverse other
Wares: But for Cloves it is true; they are now worth eleaven shillings the
pound, Maces in sorts tenn shillings, Nutmeges five shillings, because the
Hollanders by the expulsion of our people, have now three years past, and
still do keep us by force from the trade of those Spices: In which Wares when
we enjoyed the freedom in the Indies that unto us belongs, We sold Cloves
here at five shillings six pence, Maces at six shillings, Nutmegs at two
shillings six pence the pound: But as the Dutch have raised the price of these
Commodities, so would they much more inhaunce them and all other the rich Wares
of those Countries, if we should abandon or be basely driven from the trade.

THe next Quere needs but little proof, for who can truly say that his
Majesty's Customs and Impost are not multiplied, when the traffic of this
Kingdom is so much increased, only this we will affirm, that if the trade
to the East Indies were so well encouraged that it might be effectually
followed, it would yearly bring to his Majesty's Coffers much more then now it
does.

THe next Quere concerns the Kingdom nearly, for it is no small worth to
improve the price of Lands, which never has nor can be done, but by the
prosperous success of our foreign trade, The balance of our foreign trade
is the true rule of our treasure.
the balance whereof is the only means and rule of our treasure: that is to
say, When either by issuing out of the Realm yearly a greater value in Wares
then we consume of foreign Commodities we grow rich, or by spending more
of Strangers goods then we sell them of our own, we are impouerished; For,
the first of these Courses does bring in the money which we have, the last
will carry it away again when we have got it. It is a true saying, that
plenty or scarsitie of money makes all things dear or cheap in a
Commonwealth, but it is necessary to distinguish the seeming plenties of money
from that which only is substantial and able to perform the work; For there
are diverse ways and means to procure plenty of money into a Kingdom, (for a
short time) which do not therefore enrich, but rather impoverish the same, by
the several inconveniences which ever accompany such alterations.

FOr first, if we should melt down our Plate into Coin, (which suits not with
the Majesty of so great a Kingdom, except in cases of great extremity,) it
would cause plenty of money for a time, yet should we be nothing the richer,
but rather this Treasure being thus altered, is made the more apter to be
carried out of the Kingdom, if we exceed our means by excess in foreign
wares, or maintain a War by Sea or Land, where we do not feed and cloth
the Soldier, and supply the armies with our own native provisions; by which
disorders our Treasure will soon be exhausted, for it is not the Merchants
exchange by bills that can prevent the last of these evils, as some have
supposed. Again if we think to bring in store of money by suffering
foreign Coins to pass current here at higher rates then their intrinsic
value, compared with our standard; or by debasing, or by inhaunsing our own
moneys (as some men have proiected) all these actions bring their several
inconveniences, and notable ruins, as well to the King, as to his Subjects; of
which we omit to enlarge, (because it is not much pertinent to our cause in
hand) but rather admitting that by these courses, plenty of money might be
brought into the Realm, yet should we be nothing the richer, neither can such
treasure (so gotten) long remain With us, Treasure which cannot long remain
with us.
for, whether it be the Stranger or the English Merchant that brings in this
money, it must ever be done upon a valueable consideration, either for wares
carried out already, or after to be exported, which helps us nothing except
the evil occasions of excess or War aforenamed be removed, which will
exhaust our treasure; for otherwise, the money that one man brings in for
gain, an other man shall be forced to carry out for necessity, because there
shall ever be a necessity to balance our account with Strangers, although it
should be done with great loss upon the rate of the money which is exported,
and peril or confiscations also, if it be intercepted by the Law, for
necessity or gain will ever find some means to violate such Laws.

THe business then is briefly thus, that as the treasure which is brought into
the Realm by the balance of our foreign trade, Treasure that does remain
with us enrich us, and does improve our Lands.
is that money which only does abide with us, and by which we are enriched, so
by this plenty of money thus gotten (and no otherwise) do our lands improve,
for when the Merchant has a good dispatch beyond the Seas, for his Cloth, and
other our native wares, he does presently return to buy up the greater
quantity which raises the price of Woolls, and other commodities, which does
improve the Landlords rents, as the Leases expire daily; and also by this
means money being gained and brought more abundantly into this Kingdom, it
does enable many men to buy Lands which must make them the dearer: but if our
foreign Trade come to a stop or declination by neglect at home or injuries
abroad, whereby the Merchants are impoverished, and so the Wares of the Realm
less issued, then do all the said benefits cease, and our Lands fall of price
daily: whereupon we conclude, that as the flourishing estate of our general
Trade is the only means to make our Lands improve, so the particular Trade to
the East Indies, is a Principal instrument therein, because (as we have
already proved,) it has so much increased the traffic of this Kingdom.

THe next Quere seems to be a mystery, which many of our Adventurers do not
well understand, for (say they) how can the Kingdom gain by this Trade, when
we who are the members thereof, have lost so grievously? they do not well
discern that their private loss may be far less in proportion, then the
public benefit, as we shall instance some examples to make the business plain.

IN the course of foreign Trade, Three degrees of gain in foreign Trade.
there be three sorts or degrees of gain, the first is, that of the Common
Wealth, which may be done when the Merchant (who is principal agent therein)
shall loose. The second is the gain of the Merchant, which he does sometimes
justly and worthily effect, although the Common Wealth be a looser. The third
is the gain of the King, whereof he is ever certain even when the Common
Wealth and the Merchant shall be both loosers.

COncerning the first of these, we have already sufficiently showed the ways
and means whereby the Common Wealth may be enriched in the course of Trade, by
the balance of the same, when excesses are avoided: therefore it is needelesse
here to make any further repetition; only we do in this place affirm that
such happiness may be in the Common Wealth, when the Merchant for his
particular shall have no occasion to rejoice. As for example; suppose the East
India Company should send out one hundred thousand pounds in Wa^es or Money
into the East Indies, and receive home for the same, the full value of three
hundred thousand pounds, hereby it is evident that this part of the Public
Stock is trebled, and yet we may boldly say, that which we can well prove,
that our said Company of Merchants shall be loosers by such an adventure, if
the returns be made in Spice, Indico, Callicoes, Benjamin, refined Salt
Peeter, Cotton-yarne, and such other bulkey wares in their several
proportions, according to their vent and use in these parts of Europe: for the
freight of shipping, the insurance of the Adventure, the charges of Factors
abroad, and Officers at home, the forbearance of the Stock, his Majesty's
custom and imposts, with other petty charges incident, will be above two
hundred thousand pounds, which being added to the principal produces loss,
The King and Kingdom may get by Trade even when the Merchant loses.
and thus we see that not only the Kingdom, but also the KING may get very
much, even when the Merchant notwithstanding shall loose in his proportion,
which gives good occasion here to consider how much more the Realm is
enriched by this Trade, when all things pass so happily that the Merchant is a
gayner also together with the KING and Kingdom.

But for the better explayning of that which has been already alleged, we
must understand that if the said hundred thousand pounds should be trebled by
the return of so much Silks and other fine Wares out of the Indies, then the
Merchant likewise should receive good gain by such an adventure; and the
reason is, because this great wealth would require but five hundred tunn of
Shipping to lade and bring home the same, which is but a very small charge in
respect of four thousand and five hundred tons of Shipping, which would be
required to lade home the like value in the bulky Commodities of Spice and the
like, which are afore-written.

THe second sort of gain in the course of trade is, when the Merchant by his
laudable endeavors may both bring in and carry out Wares to his advantage, by
buying them and selling them to good profit, which is the end of his labors:
Yet nevertheless, the Commonwealth shall decline and grow poor by a
disorder in the people, when through pride and other excesses they do consume
more foreign Ware in value, then the Wealth of the Kingdom can satisfy and
pay by the exportation of our own Commodities, which is the very quality of
an unthrift, who spends beyond his means.

THe third sort of gain is the Kings, who is ever sure to get by Trade, when
both the Commonwealth and the Merchant shall loose severally, as
afore-written; or jointly, as it may and does sometimes happen when the
Merchants success is bad, and when our Commodities are over-ballanced by
foreign Wares consumed: but if such disorders be not prevented, his Majesty
in the end shall be the greatest looser, when his Subjects be impoverished.

Whether it be not a means greatly to weaken the King of Spain and his
Subjects, and to exhaust their treasure. Whether it be not a means to
counterpoiz the Hollanders swelling greatness by trade, Safety
and to keep them from being absolute Lords of the Seas, if they may drive us
out of this rich Traffic, as they have long endeavored to perform both by
policy and force.

THe safety of the Kingdom consists not only in i'ts own strength and
wealth, but also in the laudable and lawful performance of those things which
will weaken and impoverish such powerful Princes, as either may or are become
our Enemies; amongst which we will now rank the Spaniard in the first place,
for his ambition has no bounds, and being enabled by the power of his Indian
Treasure, not only to keep in subjection many goodly States and Provinces in
Italy, the Low Countries, and elsewhere, (which otherwise would soon fall from
his obeisance) but also by a continual War taking his advantages, does still
enlarge his Dominions, aiming at nothing more then Monarchy by this plenty of
his money, which are the very synnewes of his strength, that lie so far
dispersed into so many Countries, yet hereby united, and his wants supplied
both for war and peace in a plentiful manner from all the parts of
Christendom, which are therefore partakers of his treasure by a necessity of
Commerce, Spanish treasure is exhausted by a necessity of commerce.
Wherein the Spanish policy has ever indevoured to prevent all other Nations
the most it could; For, finding Spain to be too poor and barren to supply it
self and the West Indies, with those varieties of foreign Wares, whereof
they stand in need, they knew well that when their native Commodities come
short to this purpose, then their moneys must serve to make up the reckoning;
whereupon they found incredible advantage by adding the traffic of the East
Indies to the treasure of the West: Spanish policy and proffit in the East
India trade.
For the last of these being employed in the first, they stored themselves
infinitely with rich wares, to barter with all the parts of Christendom for
their commodities, and so furnishing their own necessities, prevented others
for carrying away theirmonies, which in point of State they hold less
dangerous to impart to the remote Indians then to their neighbor Princes,
least it should too much enable them to resist (if not offend) their Enemies:
And this Spanish policy against others is the more remarkable being done
likewise so much to their own advantage; For, every Ryall of Eight which they
sent to the East Indies brought home so much wares, as saved them the
disbursing of six Royalls of Eight here in Europe (at the least) to their
neighbors; especially in those times when that trade was only in their hands:
but now this great proffit is failed, and the mischief removed by the English
and Dutch, who partake in those East India trades as amply as the Spanish
Subjects.

IT is further to be considered that besides the disability of the Spanyard, by
their native commodities to provide foreign wares for their necessities
(whereby they are forced to supply their wants with money) they have likewise
that Canker of war which does infinitely exhaust their Treasure and disperse
it into Christendom even to their Enemies, Spanish Treasure is exhausted by
war.
part by reprisall, but especially thorough a necessary maintenance of those
Armies which are composed of many Strangers, and lie so far remote that they
cannot feed, cloth, or other wise provide them out of their own native
means and provisions, but must receive this relief from other Nations: The
effects of different wars concerning Treasure.
which kind of war is far different to that which a Prince makes upon his
own confines, or in his Nauies by Sea, where the Soldier receiving moneys for
his wages must every day deliver it out again for his necessities, whereby the
Treasure re^aines still in the Kingdom, although it be exhausted from the King
but we see that the Spanyard (trusting in the power of his treasure) undertakes
Wars in Germany and other remote places which would soon beggar the richest
Kingdom in Christendom of all their money, the want whereof would presently
disorder and bring the Armies to confusion, as it falls out sometimes with
Spain it self (who has the fountain of money) when either it is stopped in
the passage by the force of their Enemies, or drawn out faster then it flows
by their own occasions; whereby also we often see that Gold and Silver is so
scarce in Spain, that they are forced to use base copper money, to the great
confusion of their trade in want of supplies, and not without the undoing also
of many of their own people.

But now that we have seen the occasions by which the Spanish treasure is
dispersed into so many places of the world; The Spanish treasure which is
exhausted either by commerce or war, does all come in the end into the
general commerce of diverse Nations.
it is needful likewise to discover, how and in what proportion each Country
does partake of these moneys: For we find that Turkey, and diverse other
Nations have great plenty thereof, although they drive no Trade with Spain,
which seems to tontradict the former reason, where we say that this treasure is
obtained by a necessity of commerce; but to clear this point we must know,
that all Nations (who have no mines of their own) are enriched with Gold and
Silver by one and the same means, which is already showed to be the balance
of their foreign trades, and this is not strictly tied to be done in those
Countries where the fountain of treasure is, but rather with such order and
observations in the trade and against excess as are prescribed: for suppose
England by commerce with Spain may get and bring home Five Hundred thousand
Ryalls of Eight yearly, yet if we loose as much by our Trade in Turkey, and
therefore carry the money thither, it is not then the English but the Turks
who have got this treasure; although they have no trade with Spain, from
whence it was first brought. Again if England having thus lost with Turkey,
do notwithstanding gain twice as much by France, Italy, and other members of
her general trade, then will there remain Five Hundred thousand Ryalls of
Eight clear gaynes by the balance of the same; and this comparison holds
between all other Nations, both for the manner of getting, and the proportion
that is yearly gotten. But if yet a question should be made whether all
Nations get Treasure, and Spain only loose it: we answer no; for some
Countries by war or by excess do loose that which they had gotten, as well
as Spain by War and want of Wares does loose that which was its own.

ANd so much shall suffice to show, that to partake in the trade of the East
Indis, does not only weaken the Spaniards Navigations and strengthen our own;
but also to impeach him in this rich Trade, does mightily exhaust his Treasure
and increase our moneys.

Having done with a powerful Enemy the Spaniard, we must now say something of
our professed friends, the Hollanders, who of late years are become a
flourishing People, The Hollande^s greatness by Trade.
Wealthy and strong, both by Sea and Land, by nothing else but Trade; and yet
we know that they have little in their own Country wherewithal to Trade; but
we must not therefore imagine, that so great a building is either raised or
can stand without a strong foundation, which these industrious men wanting
means in their own Land, do find out rich Mines in his Majesty's Seas;
Golden Mines we may term them, for so the Lords States themselves do call
them, The Hollanders best foundation is the English Fishing.
and thus also in their public Proclamations, which they have set forth in
all occasions for the better preservation of this Fishing, a treasure it is
(indeed) inestimable, and an employment most profitable: From hence originally
proceeds the increase and maintenance of their People, their flourishing Arts,
their private wealth, their public Treasure, the multitude of their Ships
which fetch materials, to build ships, the swarms of their small Vessels which
catch Fish, to lade their great Ships which Trade with Fish; the proceed
whereof does furnish them with all their wants of foreign Wares, and makes
them also rich in Treasure; with which Treasure they do also enlarge their
Trade into all the quarters of the world, whereby they are become the Magazines
for England, France, Spain, Turkey, and other places, for Corn, Cordage,
English Ordnance, Powder, Shot, Ships, Wines, Fruits, Canuas, and many others,
besides the rich Wares from the East and West Indies, serving each Country
according to their several wants and occasions: In which course of Trade, they
are not less injurious to supplant others (especially the English) then they
are careful to strengthen themselves with more then ordinary diligence; for
they know well, that, Trade has raised their Fortunes, and does feed their
Hopes; We desire not here to aggrauate their Actions against us in the East
Indies, for they are already too well known to all the World, but we rather
with patience expect the means of our satisfaction and future safety; wherein
we doubt not of his Majesty's most gracious favors and resolutions so well
begun, and in so good away to settle and support a Trade of such great
consequence; the which if the Hollanders might soly enjoy (as they endeavor)
they would (by the power thereof) soon make themselves Masters (also) of our
other best Trades into the Streights, If our Trade to the East Indies should
fall, our other best Trades will fall with it.
and be the only Merchants even of our Cloth and other native Commodities into
those Countries, as they are already possessed of the Exportation of (almost)
all our Herrings and Newland Fish, to the maintenance of their Shipping and
decay of ours, which is the more considerable because it may be wished, that
Victuals and Ammunition, should either not be Exported, or else be only
Lycensed to the natural Subjects, but the Hollanders are diligent obseruers of
such occasions as may give them advantage; they know well how to work their
own ends in all places where they come, and as they have infinitely prevailed
in the augmentation of their Trade by the declination of other Nations, so they
aim at nothing more now then to weaken the English in their Traffic, for we
only are their Corriuals, able to keep them from the absolute Dominion of the
Seas, wherein we may hope ever to prevail if we loose not the power we
possess, and the rich Trades which we have so well discovered.

Whether it be not the best means we have to increase the Treasure or Money of
this Kingdom. Treasure


THis position is so contrary to the common opinion, that it will require
strong Arguments, to maintain and prove it, before it will be accepted,
especially of the multitude, who bitterly exclaim when they see any Moneys
carried out of the Realm; affirming thereupon that we have absolutely lost so
much Treasure, being an Act against the long continued Laws of this Kingdom,
and that many other places, nay, Spain it self (which is the fountain of
Money) forbids the Exportation thereof, some cases only excepted. To all which
we might answer, that Venice, Florence, Gaenoa, Sauoy, Marcellis, Turkey, the
Low Countries, and diverse other places permits it, their people applaudes it,
and find great benefit by it; but all this makes a noise and proves nothing:
We must therefore come to those reasons which concern the business in
question.

FIrst, therefore we will take that for granted which none will deny us, that
we have no other means to get Treasure but by Foreign Trade, We have no
treasure but by trade.
for Mines we have none which do afford it, and how this Money is gotten in
the mannaging of our said Trade, we have already showed, that it is done by
making our Commodities which are Exported, to over balance in Value the
foreign wares which we consume; so that it rests only to show how our
moneys may be added to our Commodities, and being jointly exported may so much
the more increase our Treasure.

ANd here we will suppose, that our yearly consumption of foreign wares is
to the value of twenty hundred thousand pounds, and our exportations to exceed
that two hundred thousand pounds, A near estimation of our yearly
exportations and importations as they have bin found by good inquiry.
which sum we may thereupon affirm is brought to us in Treasure to balance
the account; but now if we add three hundred thousand pounds more in ready
money unto our former exportation in Wares, what profit can we have (will some
men say) although by this means we should bring in so much ready money more
then we did before, seeing that we have carried out the like value.

TO this the answer is, that when we have prepared our exportations of wares,
and sent out as much of every thing as we can spare or vent abroad; it is not
therefore said, that then we should add our money thereunto to fetch in the
more money immediately, but rather first to enlarge our trade therewith, by
inabling us to bring in more foreign wares, which being sent out again into
the places of their consume, they will in due time much increase our Treasure:
For, although in this manner we do yearly multiply our importations to the
maintenance of more shipping and Mariners, improuement of his Majesty's
Customs and other benefits; yet our consumption of those foreign wares is no
more the^ it was before; so that all the said increase of commodities brought
in by the means of our ready money sent out as is before written, does in the
the end become an exportation unto us of a far greater value then our said
moneys were, which is proved by three several examples following.

FIrst, we will suppose that one hundred thousand pounds sterling, being sent in
our shipping into the East Cuntries, will buy there one hundred thousand
quarters of wheat clear of all charges aboard the ships, which being after
brought into England and housed, to export the same at the best time for vent
thereof in Spain or Italy, it cannot yield less in those parts then Two
Hundred Thousand Pounds to make the Merchant but a sauer, yet by this reckoning
we see the Kingdom has doubled that Treasure.

Again this proffit will be far greater when we trade thus with our money
in remote Countries, The trade to the East Indies (in its proportion) is the
best trade and means we have to increase our Treasure.
as for example, if we send one hundred thousand pounds into the East Indies
to buy pepper there and bring it hither, and from hence send it for Italy or
Turkey, it must yield five hundred thousand pounds at least in those places, in
regard of the excessive charge which the Merchant disbourseth in those long
voyages in shipping, wages, victuals, insurance, interest, customs, imposts,
and the like: all which charges notwithstanding the King and the Kingdom gets.
And we may here observe, that as the public proffit by foreign trade is
the only means whereby we gain our Treasure: So this trade to the East
Indies (in its proportion) does far excel all others.

THe third example is, where the voyages are short and the wares rich, which
therefore will not employ much shipping, the profit to the Kingdom will be far
less; as when an other hundred thousand pounds shall be employed in Turkey in
raw silks and brought hither to be after transported from hence into France
the Low Countries or Germany, the Merchant shall have good gain although he
sell it there for one Hundred and Fifty Thousand Pounds: and thus take the
voyages all together in their medium the ready moneys exported will be
returned unto us near trebled. But if any man will yet object that these
returns come to us in wares, and not really in moneys as they were issued out.

THe answer is, (keeping our first ground) that if our consumption of foreign
wares, be no more yearly then is already supposed, and that our exportations
be so mightily increased by this manner of Trading with ready money as is
before declared: it is not then possible (in the course of trade) but that all
the over balance or difference should return either in money or in such wares
as we must Export again; which as is already plainly showed will be still a
greater means to increase our Treasure: For it is in the stock of a Kingdom,
as in the estates of private men, who having store of wares, do not therefore
say that they will not venture out, or trade with their money; (for this were
ridiculous) but do also turn that into wares, whereby they multiply their
money; and so by a continual and orderly change of one into the other grow
rich, and when they please, turn al their estates into Treasure, for they that
have wares cannot want money, and therefore the former objection is not
considerable: for what begot the moneys which we sent out, but our wares.

NEither is it said that Money is the life of Trade, as if it could not subsist
or pass current without the same; for we know that there was great Trading by
way of Commutation or Barter, when there was little Money stirring in the
world. The Italians and some other Nations have such remedies against this
want, that it can neither decay nor hinder their Trade, for they transfer
Bills of Debt, and have other ways whereby they assign their Credits from one
to an other daily for very great sums with ease and satisfaction by Writing
only, Money inlargeth trade, and trade increases money.
whilst in the mean time, the Mass of Treasure which gave foundation, to
those Credits is employed in Foreign Trade as a merchandise, which does much
increase their Traffic. It is not therefore the keeping of our Money in the
Kingdom, which makes a quick and ample Trade, but the necessity and use of
our Wares in foreign Countries, and our want of their commodities which
causes the Vent and Consumption on all sides.

WE must not here forget the practice of the great Duke of Tuscany in his Port
of Leghorne, which of late years from a poor Town is become a fair City,
and one of the most famous places for Trade in Chrystendome, by the resort of
many Nations, but most especially by the English and Dutch with Merchandise, to
a very great value yearly, and yet it is worthy observation that the multitude
of Ships and Wares which come thither, have little or no means to make their
returns from thence, but only in ready Money, which they may, and do carry
away freely at all times and without Custom, and such charges to the
incredible advantage, of the said Duke of Tuscanie and his Subjects, who are
much enriched by the continual great concourse of Merchants, from all the
States of the neighbor Princes, bringing them plenty of Monye daily to
supply their wants of the said wares. And thus we see that the Current of
Merchandise which carries away their Treasure, becomes a flowing stream to
fill them again In a greater measure with Money.

THe example of this growing greatness, has lately moved the Duke of Sauoy,
publickely to declare his Princely resolution to all Nations, offering them
many Privileges and immunities, that shall come to Trade in his free Port of
Vila Franca, and especially a liberty to carry away ready Monyes for all the
Wares they bring, or other occasions: and yet we know that neither in Tuscanie
or Sauoy, are any Mines or Moneys more then they have and do daily get by
trade; but they know likewise that if we yearly bring them wares (although
for a very great value) the money will immediately follow; For, let no man
doubt but that money must ever attend on Merchandise, for they go together:
And it is worthy the noting that those Princes are content to part with their
treasure only to enjoy the trade of the wares which are brought them, for which
(to encourage the Merchant) they take no Custom; whereas we by sending out
our money do gain the employment of our shipping, the trade of the wares, and
the proffit of the Customs which is a treble benefit.

THere is yet an objection or two as weak as all the rest: The first is, that
if we trade with our money, we shall issue out the less wares; as if a man
should say, those Countries which heretofore had occasion to consume our
Cloth, Lead, Tynn, Iron, Fish, and the like shall now make use of our moneys
in the place of those necessaries, which to affirm were most absurd, or that
the Merchant had not rather carry out wares (by which there is ever some gains
expected) then to export money, which is still but the same without any
increase.

But on the contrary there are many Countries which may yield us very large and
profitable traffic for our money, that otherwise afford us no trade at all
because they have no use of our wares, as namely the East Indies for one, in
the first beginning thereof although since by industry in our Co^merce with
those Nations we have brought them into the use of much of our Cloth, Lead,
Tynn, and other things, which is a good addition to the former vent of our
commodities.

Again, some men have alleged that those Countries which permit money to be
carried out, do it, because they have few or no wares to trade withal: but we
have great store of Commodities, and therefore their action ought not to be our
example.

TO this the answer is briefly; That if we have such a quantity of wares, as
does fully provide us of all things needful from beyond the Seas, why should
we then doubt that our moneys sent out in trade must not necessarily come
back again in Treasure. together with the great gains which it may procure
in such manner as is before set down? And on the other side if those Nations
which send out their moneys, do it because they have few wares of their own;
how come they then to have so much Treasure as we ever see in those places,
which suffer it freely to be exported at all times and by whom so ever. We
answer even by trading with their moneys: For by what other means can they get
it, having no mines of Gold or Silver?

THus may we plainly see, that when this weighty business is duly
considered in its end (as all our human actions ought well to be weighed) it
is found much contrary to that which most men esteem thereof, Our humane
actions ought especially to be considered in their ends.
because they search no further then the beginning of this work, which
misinformes their judgments and leads them into error: For if we only
behold the actions of the Husbandman in the seed time, when he casts away
much good corn into the ground, we will rather account him a madd man then a
Husbandman: but when we consider his labors in the Harvest, which is the end
of his endeavors; We find the worth and plentiful increase of his actions.

Whether it be not an honor suitable to the Majesty of so great a King and
Kingdom. Honor.


WE have endeavored upon all the former Queres to be as brief as conveniently
we might without obscurity, and now upon this last point there will be no
occasion at all to enlarge; for when it shall be found that the trade to the
East Indies is so good a means to increase our strength, wealth, safety, and
treasure, and that those discoueries have spread his Majesty's fame into
Persia, Iapon, China, the Dominions of the great Mogull, and many other remote
Nations of the Eastern world, there will be no ^ denial, but that these great
blessings are so precious and honorable both to the King and his Kingdoms,
that they ought to be preserved with our best endeauours against the strongest
opposition.

And for conclusion the East India Company do humbly declare unto this
Honorable House, that they have not made their Petition and this Remonstrance
for their own private ends, but for the public good; And even so having
performed their duties, they hope it shall be their sufficient discharge in all
future times concerning the Suppressing or Supporting of the said Trade.

FINIS.
