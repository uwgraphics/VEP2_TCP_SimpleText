By the Queen.
THe Queens most excellent Majesty, finding the great misusage in the
execution of sundry her Highness grants made to diverse persons, touching
certain penal Statutes, made and set forth for the common benefit and
utility of her people, and touching the obtaining and recovery of Lands and
Tenements concealed, and of sundry bands, forfeitures, and other things
pretended to be unjustly withholden and concealed from her Highness and her
Crown: By pretense whereof, she perceives a great multitude of her loving
Subjects, contrary to the intention of her Majesty's said grants, in many cases
(though not offending) to have been greatly vexed and molested, and the Laws
not thereby any thing the better executed, but in some parts rather impaired,
nor any such profit recovered, or obtained to her Highness use upon such
executions (and contealements, as was pretended: most graciously minding the
common quiet and profit of her loving Subjects, and willing to remove all
occasions of such griefs to her people, as things whereof she always has
had, and yet still has utter misliking: Expressly wills and commands that
the execution of all such special grants and Commissions made to particular
persons touching the premises, and all Commissions not being returned into any
her Majesty's courts of Record made upon, or by virtue of any such grants,
shall from henceforth cease. And that no new Commissions upon any the grants
aforesaid, do from henceforth pass any her Majesty's Seals, nor any Process or
Writ to be awarded, nor information from henceforth received, upon or by
virtue of any such Grants or Commission, out of any her Majesty's Courts of
Record whatsoever.

And further her Majesty commands, that no Commissions or Commissioner, or
other person whatsoever, already authorized to execute any such Grant or
Commission, shall from henceforth deal or proceed any further by inquisition of
Jurors, examination of witnesses, or certificate, or by any other ways or
means whatsoever, to execute any the said Grants or Commissions upon pain of
imprisonment, and incurring her Majesty's displeasure. And her Highness does
further straightly prohibit and forbid all her Justices of the Peace, Majors,
Sheriffs, Constables, Bailiffs of Liberties, and other her Officers and
ministers whatsoever, as they tender the avoiding of her Highness displeasure,
from henceforth to be in any wise aiding or assisting to the execution of any
the said Statutes or Commissions. And for the better execution of the
Premises, if any person or persons contrary to her Majesty's Proclamation and
Prohibition, shall presume or execute any the said Grants or Commissions, or to
be in any wise ayding or assisting thereunto: Then her Highness will and
express commandment is to all Justices of the Peace, Majors, Sheriffs,
Bailiffes, and all other her Officers and ministers whatsoever, to whom it
shall or may appertain, to attach and apprehend all and every such Offendour
and Offenders, and them to commit to the common Jail of the country where
such offenses shall be committed, there to remain without Bail or Maineprise,
until her Highness pleasure shall by her Honorable Privy Counsel, or
otherwise be signified what shall be further done in that behalf.

Provided nevertheless, That where by means of the said Grants diverse Suits
are already commenced by the parties, and some of them depending in sundry her
Majesty's Courts by way of Information or otherwise, at the charge of the said
Patentees, her Highness also minding to put the same Suits to some good end,
with the reasonable contentation of her Subjects, does by virtue hereof
authorize the Lord Chancellor of England, the Lord Treasourer of England, the
Chancellor of her Court of Exchequer, and the Barons of the same Court, or two
of them, whereof the Lord Chancellor to be one, for all causes determinable in
the Chancery, and the Lord Treasourer one for all causes determinable in the
Exchequer, to hear, order, end, or compound all the said causes as shall stand
with equity to the quiet of the parties molested, and the reasonable
satisfaction of the Patentees aforesaid, ratifying and allowing whatsoever the
said Lord Chancellor, Lord Treasourer, Chancellor and Barons as above is
limited, shall do or conclude touching the Premises.

Given at our Manor of Greenwich the xv. of December, the two and twentieth
year of our Reign. Anno 1579.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens most
Excellent Majesty.
