THE COPPIE OF SIR William Erskin and John Meldrum, their Letters Patents for
the Lights at Winterton.
JAMES by the grace of God, King of England, Scotland, France and Ireland
Defender of the faith etc.

To all to whom these presents shall come, greeting. Whereas we have bin
lately informed, that the Seas near and about the parts of Wintertonnesse in
our County of Norffolke are of great danger and peril for passing of Ships
sailing unto the North Coast in dark and foul nights, by reason of a Sand
lying in length from the maine land two furlongs or there abouts, upon the
which of late years many great losses have happened to our Subjects sailing
near the same Coast, as well by the lamentable wrack of diverse Ships there as
by the loss of many of our subjects their lives and goods, which have been
occasioned by the want of Light howses and lights that might have been
provided and set up, at or as near the said Nesse for direction of Sailors
trading or passing to and fro those parts which by the help of such
Light-houses and lights might have well bin saved and prevented. And that for
the scaping and preventing of the dangers of those parts for the time to come,
it is very convenient and necessary that light-howses should be there erected
with lights therein continually burning, and maintained in the night time, for
the direction and safe conduct of Ships passing by or along the said coast
in the night time in dark and foul nights, and that almost all the masters
and owners of Shippinge, trading to our Town of Newcastle for Coals,
Fishermen and other Masters and Owners of other shipping, tratrading upon the
said North coast, have heretofore greatly desired the erection of light-houses
and lights there to be set up and maintained, and have offered to contribute
for, and toward the erection and continual maintenance of the same, as by an
inquisition or certificate taken at the City of Norwich in the Cou^ty of
Norffolke the eight day of January last past before John Corbett, John Smith,
Owen Sheppard, and Roger Godsalue, Esquires: our Commissioners by virtue of Our
Commission under our great seal of England, baring date at Westminster the
sixteenth day of December last past, unto them and others directed by the
oaths of sundry good and lawful men of our Towns of great Yarmouth and
Winterton in the said County, and returned into and remaining of record in our
Court of Chancery: amongst other things more at large it does and may more
appear. We therefore out of our princely office and care intending hereafter
to provide for as well the safety of the lives and goods of our subjects and
others as of the shipping of our Kingdoms, (being a principal honor and
strength of the same) and unwilling that our loving subjects and others passing
by the said North Coast should undergo and continue still under the danger and
hazard of the said perilous Sands whereunto by woeful experience they have
heretofore been too much subject. And having been informed by our learned
Counsel that the erection and mayntenance of such Light-houses and Lights in
places needful for the safety of our subjects, is a right and power remaining
in us, notwithstanding the power or authority heretofore given by the statute
made in the eight year of the Reign of our late decre Sister Queen Elizabeth
to the Master, Wardens, and Assistants of the Trinitie-house of Debtford
Strond for erecting of Beacons, Signs, and Sea marks, have thought fit and
necessary, and by these presents we do for us, our Heirs and successors,
will ordain and appoint that some one or more convenient Lighthouse or
Lighthouses shall be erected made and set up, at or near such fit and
convenient place or places at or within the space of two miles of Winterton
aforesaid as by the persons hereafter by us named and authorized in that
behalf their Executors, Administrators or Assigns their substitute or
substitutes or some or one of them shall be thought meet and necessary from
time to time and that continually in the night season in dark and foul nights
sufficient lights shall therein by the persons hereafter named their Executors
or Assigns, substitute or substitutes, or some or one of them and at their
proper costs and charges from time to time be kept and maintained for the
direction, condition, and preservation of Ships, Hoyes, Barks, Fishermen or
other vessels whatsoever which shall sail or pass by or along the said
North Coast, and that as well the said Lighthouse or Lighthouses which sha I
hereafter be by them so built and erected, shall or may from time to time by
the said persons hereafter by us named and appointed their Executors,
Administrators, or Assigns, substitute or substitutes be altered, renewed,
removed, and changed as by the accidents and mooueables, and channels at or
near Wintertonesse aforesaid shall or may require for the safer conduction and
guiding of Sailors ships, Fisher-barkes, and other vessels whatsoever, passing
or repassing from Port to Port, by or along the said Coast as well by night
as by day.

And for as much as the erection, reparation, remoouing, changing, and
continual maynteyning of the said Light-houses and Lights in the same there
Will from time to time require a great and continual charge for the
supportation and maintenance of the same. We will, ordain, and appoint for us
our Heirs and successors that there shall be collected and taken of an for
every Ship, Hoy, Bark, Fisherman, or other vessel whatsoever that shall

Tun as aforesaid we will shall be delivered and paid to the hands of such
officer and officers or other person or persons as the persons hereafter named,

lawfully demand, receive, and take the moyetie, or one half thereof,
according to the true meaning of this our grant, of, and from the Merchants
and owners of the goods in the Ships, Hoyes, Barks and vessels, from time to
time, according to the quantity of the goods and Marchandizes wherewith the
said Ships, Hoyes, Barks or vessels shall be fraught or laden.

And that the said persons hereafter named, their or either of their executors,
