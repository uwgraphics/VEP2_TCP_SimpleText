BY THE RIGHT REVEREND FATHER IN GOD, GEORGE DOWNHAM, Doctor of Divinity, and
Lord Bishop of DERRY.

PSALM. 119. 96. I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy Commandment is
exceeding broad.

AT LONDON, Imprinted by FELIX KYNGSTON. 1620.

TO THE TRVE LOVER OF VERTVE AND RELIGIon, Mistress MARGARET HARE, widow, the
late dear and loving wife of JOHN HARE Esquire, of the Inner Temple, and
chief Clerk of his Majesty's Court of Wards and Liueries.
THe Reverend Author of this Book, having now full twenty years since, in his
public exercises finished a very large Treatise upon the Decalogue, or ten
Commandments of Almighty God, was then pleased at my earnest entreaty, and for
my private use, to collect and gather out of that large Treatise, the sum and
heads of what was therein more largely handled, which I purposed still,
according to his first intent, to have kept by me for my private use: but
since, having been often importuned by many learned and religious Ministers for
the loan thereof, whereto I had almost yielded, had I not considered the wrong
and injury which thereby might redound to the Author, if the same should
happen to be printed, either by some imperfect copy, or under the name of some
other, especially, if ever the Author should be pleased to publish those his
larger volumes. And therefore for satisfaction of the request of my friends, I
endeavored to gain the Authors consent to the publishing hereof; which having
obtained, I have now put the same in print for the public and general good,
and do dedicate the same unto you, not only to be a help to you in your
private meditations in the Law of God, but also as a testimony of my
thankfulness for your many favors both to me and mine. The Almighty God make
it profitable for the end intended: to whose blessed protection I commend you,
and will ever rest

Yours in all Christian duty to be commanded, BASIL NICOLL.

THE PREFACE, CONTAINING RVLES OF direction, for the expounding of the
Commandments.
WHereas the holy Ghost testifies, that the Law of God, Psalm. 19. 7.
(though propounded in ten words) is so perfect, that nothing may be added to
it, and so large, that nothing may be compared therewith: Ps. 119. 96.
It must therefore be confessed, that the sense of the Commandments is so to
be enlarged, as that they may be understood to be the perfect Pandects (as it
were) of Christians; forbidding all vices which the Lord condemns in his
Word; and commanding all moral duties which he requires at our hands.

And for as much as there are two principal uses of the Law; the one, to show
us our manifold sins, and the punishments due for them, that being humbled in
our selves, we might seek to Christ: the other, that it might be a perfect
rule, whereby to frame our lives and conversation; that being redeemed by
Christ, we may also be renewed according to the image of God, in true
righteousness and holiness: therefore it is very expedient, that the special
duties commanded, and vices forbidden in every Commandment, should
particularly be laid forth. That in respect of the former use, we might see
those manifold both duties which we have omitted, and also vices which we
have committed heretofore: and in respect of the latter, that we might
distinctly see and understand those particular duties which the Lord enioyneth
us to observe, and those particular vices which he charge us to shun for
the time to come.

And for our direction in this behalf, we are to expound every Commandment
according to these five rules:

1. Where any duty is commanded, there the contrary vice is forbidden; and
where any vice is forbidden, there the contrary duty is commanded.

Every Commandment therefore contains two parts; the Affirmative, commanding
the duty. Negative, forbidding y^ vice.


Whence arises a distinction of sins, that they are either sins of Omission.
Commission.


2. Under one particular vice mentioned in the Commandment, all of the same
kind are forbidden; and under one particular commanded, all of the same kind
are commanded. For the Law of God is spiritual, Romans 7. 14
and therefore requires not only outward obedience in word and deed, but also
inward in the mind and heart. Neither does it only forbid the outward sins
committed in word and deed, but also all the secret corruptions of the mind and
heart. And thus our Savior has taught us to expound the Law of God, Math. 5.
21, 22, 27, 28. and 1. Epist. Ioh. 3. 15.

Again, the Law of God is perfect, requiring perfect obedience both inward and
outward, not only in respect of the parts, but also of the degrees. Wherefore,
where any duty is commanded, there the highest degree of it is commanded, as
appears by the sum of the Law, Math. 22. 37, 38. and where any vice is
forbidden, there the least degree of it is forbidden, and bears the name of
that gross sin which is specified, that we might learn to esteem no sin
small. 1. Sam. 15. 23.
For unadvised anger is murder; and looking upon a woman to lust after her, is
forbidden under the name of adultery, as our Savior teaches, Math. 5. 22, 28.

3. Where any duty is commanded, there the means which tend thereto are
enjoined; and where any vice is forbidden, there the means, prouocations and
allurements tending thereto are also forbidden. For such as is the end, such
are the subordinate means that in their own nature do tend thereto. This
teaches, that good intentions and desires will not serve, when we are
careless of the means.

Now there are three means which are common to all duties, and therefore in
all the Precepts are commanded; and the neglect of them, or the use of the
contrary forbidden: viz. 1. Prayer: for of our selves we cannot so much as
think a good thought, 2. Cor. 3. 5. Psalm. 119. 33, 34, 35, 36.

2. Diligent hearing of the Word, Romans 10. 14, 17.

3. Good company, Prou. 13. 20. He that touches pitch, shall be defiled,
Ecclus. 13. 1. A little leaven sowreth the whole lump, 1. Cor. 5. 6. Therefore
David bids the wicked depart from him, that he might keep the
Commandments of his God, Psalm. 119. 115. and elsewhere professes, that he
avoided their company, Psalm. 26. 4, 5.

4. Where any duty is commanded, or vice forbidden, there also the signs are
commanded, or forbidden. For first, as touching virtues and duties; the graces
of God are not to be smothered, as it were candles under a bushel, but they
must be manifested to the glory of God, to the good example of others; and for
a testimony to our selves that we are endued with them, we must be careful
of honest things, not only before God, but also before men, 2. Cor. 8. 21.

And as touching vices, we are taught to abstain from all show of evil, 1.
These. 5. 22. Haughty looks, strange apparel, are condemned as signs of
pride: haunting of suspected places, Pro. 6. 17. Zeph. 1. 8.
as signs of inco^tinency, etc.

5. Duties to be procured, and vices to be avoided, not in our selves only,
but also in others. First therefore in all the Precepts is commanded the
communion of Saints to be exercised among the faithful, in an earnest desire
shown, Mat. 18. 15.
to win our neighbor unto Christ, and in a tender care taken, for the
furthering of the salvation one of another, by the duties of edification.

As namely, Heb. 3. 13.
1. In respect of duties, by stirring up one another, 1. These. 5. 11, 14.
Heb. 10. 24. by Instructing the ignorant. Dan. 12. 3.
Admonition, Romans 15. 14.
or putting our brother in mind of his duty. Exhortation unto his duty.
Encouraging him in well-doing. Comforting those which are weak. Good Counsel.
Example. Math. 5. 16. 1. Pet. 2. 12. Heb. 12. 13



2. In respect of things forbidden, to Reclame the Erroneous. Iam. 5. 19, 20.
Reprove the offendour. Leu. 19. 17. Ephesians. 5. 11. Dissuade from vice.


Secondly, in all the Precepts we are forbidden to have any fellowship with
the unfruitful works of darkness, Ephesians. 5. 11. or to be accessory to the
offenses of others, 1. Tim. 5. 22.

Men may be accessory to the offenses of others, diverse ways: whereof some are
Common, and those either Going before the offense committed, as Provocation, by
Incensing, Gal. 5. 26. Ephesians. 6. 4. Job 2. 9. 1. King. 21. 25, 7. Alluring. Pro.
1. 10. ^7. 18, 21. and hereto corrupt and infecting speeches are referred. 1.
Cor. 15. 33.
Evil counsel: 2. Sam. 13. 5. ^16. 21. 2. Chr. 22. 3, 4. Consent and
approbation, Romans 1. 32 whether it be Ouert and expressed, and that either in
Word. Act. 8. 1. ^ 26. 10. Deed. Act. 7. 58. so receivers, of theft; bawds, of
adultery; partners of the gain. Pro. 1. 14. Psalm. 50. 18.
Covert, as by silence, or dissembling the fault of our brother, when he ought
to be admonished: for as by ill speech thou bring thy brother into sin, so
by ill silence thou leauest him in sin, or suffer sin to rest upon him,
Leuit. 19. 17. Qui tacet, consentire videtur.
Evil example, occasioning another to fall: this is called a scandal, To. 14.
13. and it is either a scandal In it self as that which is evil in it self,
and is therefore an offense given, though it be not taken: as any sin
committed in the sight or notice of another. By accident, when the thing, which
in it self is indifferent, is so used, as that the weak brother is offended
thereby: that is, when he is by thine example animated to do that, which in his
own conscience he does condemn. To. 14. 20, 22. 1. Cor. 8. 9, 10.

Accompanying, or following after the offense, as ye Excusing Defending
Commending
of it. Esa. 5. 20. Prou. 24. 24.
Peculiar to Superiors, as to Command that which is evil and unlawful, either
Publicly, by wicked laws and edicts. Esa. 10. 1. Dan. 3. 4, 5. 6 Privately. 1.
Sam. 22. 18. 19. 2. Sa^. 12. 9. and 2. Sa^. 11. 15, 17
Wink at euiil, which by their authority they might redress. To. 13. 4. Mar.

The Law is divided into two Tables, the One, commanding the love of God, or
the duties of Piety toward God. Mat. 22. 37, 38. Other, commanding the love of
our neighbor, or the duties of charity and righteousness toward our
neighbor, Mat. 22. 39.


The Commandments of the first Table, prescribing the worship of God, or
Piety, teach Who is to be worshipped: viz. that Jehovah alone is to be had
and worshipped as God. Praec. 1. How, both in His solemn worship: viz. by such
means, and after such a manner as he has prescribed. Praec. 2 The whole course
of our lives, viz. by sanctifying and glorifying his name. Praec. 3.
When especially God is to be worshipped, viz. on the Sabbath, which is to be
sanctified, and consecrated to the worship and service of God. Praec. 4.


The first Commandment.
The Sum of the first Commandment.

Math. 4. 10. Thou shall have Jehovah alone for thy God.

The Affirmative part,
Containing two branches.

1. That we should have Jehovah to our God. 2. That we should have him alone.
The special duties.

We are to have God both Inwardly in our Minds, by Knowing Believing Remembering
him. Hearts, by adhering unto him.
Outwardly, and in the whole man, by honoring him.


In our minds. The duties of the mi^de.


1. The true Knowledge Knowledge
of God. Ioh. 17. 3.

Where we are to consider the Object: the truth which God has revealed
concerning himself. Deuteronomy. 29. 29. Ioh. 5. 39. 1. Tim. 2. 4. Quantity or
measure, 1. Cor. 14. 20. Col. 3. 16. which must be proportionable to our
Calling, more being required in those who are guides of others. Means. Luke
12. 48. Time which God has vouchsafed us. Heb. 5. 12.
Quality, that it be an effectual* powerful, and spiritual knowledge. 1.
Ioh. 2. 3, 4.


The Negative part.
Forbidding, 1. The not having of God, which is Atheism. 2. The having of a
false god, which is Idolatry. 3. The having of more gods than one, which is
Polytheisme.


The Opposite vices. Opposite to knowledge, in regard of the Object, both in
the Excess: curiosity, to be w^^e above that which is written. 1. Cor. 4. 6.
Desect, Ignorance 1. Cor. 15. 34. Hos. 4. 1, 6. either when men Cannot, through
their natural corrupti^n. 1. Cor. 2. 14. Romans 3. 11. and this is narurall
blindness. Will not, which is affected ignorance. 2. Pet. 3. 5. Care not to
know God. which is ^^^elesse ignorance. Pro. 1. 22. Ioh 3. 19.
The fruit of ignorance, which is, errors concerning God. Math. 22. 29.

Quantity, a small measure of knowledge. Heb. 5. 12. Esa. 28. 9, 10. Ier. 4.
22* Quality, a literal or speculatiue knowledge, severed from obedience. 1.
Ioh. 2. 4. 1. Cor. 13. 2. Luke 12. 47.


2. Faith, Faith.
whereby we give credit to the Word of God. 1. Ioh. 5. 10.

Faith, in respect of the object, is either General, whereby we give assent
to the whole Word of God. And this, in regard of the Quantity, ought to be a
full persuasion, in respect both of Understanding. Col. 2. 2 Assent. Luke 1. 1.

Quality, must be a lively, effectual and working Faith. Iam. 2. 18. Gal. 5.
6. Special, giving credit to the Threatenings of the Law to our humiliation. 2.
Chron. 34. 19, 21, 27, Io^. 3. 5. Promises of the Gospel to our justification.
Ioh. 3. 16.



3. Remembrance Remembrance.
of God. Eccl. 12. 1. Esa. 62. 6.

It contains two duties: Memory, laying up (as it were) into the treasure of
our hearts, those things which we learn concerning God and his Word. Prou. 2.
1. ^ 4. 21. Deuteronomy. 6. 6. ^ 11. 18. Luke 8. 15. Recordation, recording or
recalling to mind that which was committed to memory. Psalm. 78. 34, 35. Psalm.
22. 27.


And this ought to be Effectual, working obedience. Psalm. 119. 55. Esa. 64.
5. Entyre, and not partial: as, to remember his mercy, and not to forget his
justice, etc.


Opposed to Faith General, in the Excess, vain credulity, having no ground
in the Word of God. Defect, in respect of the Parts, viz. Understanding, such
especially is the implicit faith of Papists. Assent, Withheld from the truth,
doubting. Romans 4. 20. Math. 21. 21. Given to the contrary, falsehood. 2. Kin. 7.
2. 2. Th. 2. 11, 12. which are two degrees of infidelity.

Quantity, (...), a small measure of faith. Act. 26. 28. Quality, the idle and
dead faith. Iam. 2. 14, 17, 26.

Special, viz. Legal, infidelity working carnal security. Deuteronomy. 29. 19.
Evangelical, as the Counterfeit faith of hypocrites. Luke 8. 13. Ioh. 2. 23,
24. Infidelity of unbelievers Ioh. 3. ^.




Opp. Forgetfulness, in not Laying up, but suffering the Word of God to slip
from us. Heb. 2. 1. Deuteronomy. 6. 12. Recalling, when just occasion is offered. Job
8. 13. Deuteronomy. 8. 11, 14, 19. Psalm. 44. 20. and Psalm. 50. 22.
Remembrance, either Ineffectual, severed from obedience in men sinning
against conscience. Partial, as calling to mind either Gods Mercy alone, unto
Presumption. Justice alone, to Desperation.




In our hearts we are to adhere unto the Lord, The duties of the mind
and set our hearts upon him alone. Deuteronomy. 13. 4. Act. 11. 23. 1. Cor. 7. 35.
Ioh. 23. 8.

This is to be done by setting our affections upon God, chiefly by Trusting in
Loving Fearing
him above althings and from these three some others arise.

1. Trust or assiance, Affi^^ce in God.
in God. Pro. 3. 5. Psalm. 32. 10.^34. 8.

Which we are to have, whether we Have means, for we are not to trust in
them, but in the use of them to depend upon God. Psa. 44. 5, 6, 7.^60. 11. Want
means. Job 13. 15.
We are to trust in God, who is able to provide for us, both Without means,
Genes. 22. 14. Even in the Mount will God provide. above means. 2. Chr. 20. 12.
^14. 11. 1. Sam. 14. 6.


Opp. Removing our hearts from God, Ier. 17. 5. either by Not setting our hearts
upon God* the fault of Hypocrites. Esa. 29. 13 Profane persons. Ierem. 12. 2.
Setting our hearts upon other things, the fault of worldlings. Psalm. 62. 10.
Phil. 3. 19. who are therefore called Adulterers. Iam. 4. 4.


Oppos. as Extremes, in the Excess: tempting of God, Math. 4. 6. Defect,
diffidence, Luke 12. 29. and the fruits thereof, viz. Carking care. Mat. 6. 25,
31. Luke 21. 34. Use of unlawful means. Prou. 30. 9.

Disorder, when our affiance is reposed in other things, whether Unreasonable,
as our Instruments and means. Psa. 20. 7.^44. 6. Hab. 1. 16. Wealth and
riches. Job 31. 24. 1. Tim. 6. 17. Psalm. 52. 7. Place, either for the Strength.
Ier. 48. 7.^49. 16. Holiness. Ier. 7. 4.

Reasonable, as Men, Ier. 17. 5. though Skillful. 2. Chr. 16. 12. Mighty,
Psalm. 146. 2. Many. Hos. 10. 13. Esa. 31. 1, 3
Devils, as in Witches and wizards. Deu. 18. 10, 11. Leuit. 20. 27. Those that
seek to them. Leuit. 20. 6. 1. Chro. 10. 13.





To Affiance we are to join Hope: Hope.
for he that trusts to Gods goodness for the present, will also expect go^d
things from him for the time to come. Psalm. 37. 7. Psalm. 146. 5. Heb. 6. 19.

Her^ 2. things are to be considered, the Object, both the Person, in whom,
viz. God alone: who therefore is called our Hope. Psalm. 46. 2^62. 9. Joel 3.
16. Col. 1. 27. 1. Tim. 1. 1. Things, viz. good things to come, according to
Gods promise, both in This life, as Assistance in time of need. Psalm. 46.
1.^62. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7. Exhibition of all good things. Psalm. 104. 27, 28.
World to come, eternal life. Tit. 1. 2. 1. These. 5. 8. which, because it is
the chief object of our hope, is also called our hope. Col. 1. 5. Tit. 2. 13.

Manner how we are to hope, with Patience. Romans 8. 25. 1. These. 1. 3. Hab. 2.
3. Assurance and comfort. Romans 12. 12. Heb. 3. 6. ^6. 11. 1. Pet. 1. 13.



Opp. as Extremes, in the Excess: Presumption, as the hope of the hypocrite
and impenitent sinner: for true hope is joined with repentance. 1. Ioh. 3. 3.
and never makes ashamed. Romans 5. 5. but this does. Job 8. 13. Prou. 11. 7.
Defect, Absence of hope, as in the ignorant. Ephesians. 2. 12. 1. These. 4. 13.
Desperation, or casting off of hope, as in Epicures, who as they have cast off
all sorrow, Ephesians. 3. 19 so also all hope. 1. Cor. 15. 32. Esa. 22. 13. Ier. 18.
12. Me^ overwhelmed with sorrow. 2. Cor. 2. 7. arising from the sense of their
Affliction. Genesis 4. 13. 2. Cor. 7. 10. who therefore some times make away
themselves. Sins, and is either Te^porary and curable, as in the Elect.
Final and incurable. Mat. 27. 5 Act. 1. 18.




Disorder or (...) of hope, being placed in Our selves, or in our own merits.
Any other thing besides God, from which (as the Author) we expect good things,
either in This life, according to that which was said in the disorder of
affiance. The world to come.




2. Love Love.
of God. Psalm. 31. 23. 1. Ioh. 4. 19. Math. 22. 37.

Where consider the Measure both Simply: for he is to be loved without
measure, as he is good without measure, and has loved us without measure.
Ephesians. 3. 19. Ioh. 3. 16. but because we cannot attain to that; yet let us
love him with all our heart. Deuteronomy. 6. 5. or at the least, with an upright
heart. By comparison: for as he is infinitely good above al things, so he
ought to be loved above all things. Luke 14. 26. Math. 10. 37.
Manner: for as he is absolutely good, yea goodness and charity it self; so
he is to be loved absolutely and for himself; but all other things in him,
and for him. As for example: we are to love our Friends, in the Lord. Foes, for
the Lord.



Unto the love of God, arising from the persuasion of Gods love toward us, we
are to adioyne partly as fruits, partly as companions thereof: Zeal of Gods
glory. Rejoicing in God. Thankfulness toward God. Obedience toward God.
Patience toward God.


Oppos. as Extremes, in the defect, (for in the excess we cannot offend) Want
of the love of G^d, when we do not love him, either With all our hearts.
Above all things.
Hatred of God, which is partly Natural. Romans 8. 7 Increased by sin. Romans 1. 30.

Disorder, when we love any things as much, or more than God, Mat. 10 37. 1.
Sam. 2. 29. 1. Kin. 11. 3. hereof there are two principal sorts, viz. the
love of Our selves; I mean not the natural love of our selves, whereby we
seek our preservation (which as it is sub^rdinate to the love of God, is
lawful) nor the spiritual love of our^elues, whereby we seek our salvation;
but the carnal love of our selves, 2. Tim. 3. 12. Romans 1^. 14. Gal. 6. 8. The
world, and of those things that are therein, 1. Ioh. 2. 15, 16. as the love of
Pleasure, which is voluptuousness. 2. Tim. 3. 4. Philip 3. 19. 2. Pet. 2. 10,
12. Riches, which is covetousness. Col. 3. 5. Ephesians. 5. 3. Honor and glory, which
is ambition, and vai^eglory. Gal. 5. 26.




Zeal Zeal.
of Gods glory. 1. King. 19. 10. Apo^ 3. 19.

Here we are to consider, Wherein this zeal must shewit self. How it ought to
be qualified.


It must show it self in regard of the Means of Gods glory: and in this
respect it contains 2. duties: viz. a Fervent desire and forward care, y^ the
means of advancing Gods glory, may be used both by Themselves, Tit 2. 14^ 3.
8. Romans 12. 11. Act. 18. 25. Others. 2. Cor. 11. 2. Col. 4. 13. Hebr. 10. 24.
Willing and cheerful using of the means, and doing of the things whereby God
may be glorified. 1. Chron. 28. 9. 1. Ioh. 5. 3. Ioh. 4. 34. Psalm. 122. 1.
Esa. 58. 13. Act. 17. 11. 2 Cor. 9. 7.
Impediments of Gods glory, in respect whereof it is a compound affection of
fervent love and desire of promoting Gods glory, and a vehement indignation
conceived against the obstacles thereof. 1. King. 19. 10. Ioh. 2. 17. Numb. 25.
11. 2. Pet. 2. 7. Psalm. 119. 136.


This zeal ought to be Pure, Proceeding from a sincere affection not mixed
with Malice and emulation. Hypocrisy.
Guided by knowledge, assuring the party of the goodness of the cause. Gal. 4.
18.
Discreet, and therefore both Moderate, not exceeding the Proportion of the
cause. Bounds of a man's calling.
Seasonable. Prou. 25. 11.



Oppos. Want of zeal, whereof are two degrees: Lukewarmnesse. Apoc. 3. 15, 16.
when men are neither hot nor cold, etc. Coldness and (as it were) deadness in
Religion. Zeph. 1. 12.
Corrupt zeal, being either Mixed with corrupt affections to which it is
pretended (and therefore not sincere but counterfeit) as with Maliciousnes,
which is bitter zeal. Ia. 3. 14. Covetousness, Ioh. 12. 5, 6. Ambition and
vainglory, etc. 2. King. 10. 16, 29.
Not guided by Knowledge, which is a blind zeal. Romans 10. 2. Phil. 3. 6. Ioh.
16. 2. the which, the more fervent, the more surious it is. Act. 26. 11^22. 23.
Discretion, which is a preposterouszeale, being either Immoderate exceeding (as
in schismatics) the Proportion of ye cause. Compass of a man's calling.
Unseasonable. Ioh. 18. 10. Luke 9. 54.





Delighting and rejoicing Rejoicing in God.
in God. Psalm. 37. 4.^104. 34. Phil. 3. 1, 3. Romans 5. 11. his Word is sweet
unto them. Psalm. 19. 10. Him alone. 1. Cor. 1. 31. 2 Cor. 10. 17. Gal. 6. 14.
in Christ crucified*


And this we are to d^e at all times, Phil. 4. 4. both in the time of
Prosperity. Ier. 9. 23, 24. Adversity. 1. Sam. 30. 6. 1. These. 1. 6. Romans 5. 3,
5.


Thankfulness Thankfulness.
to God in all estates, Ephesians. 5. 20. both in time of Prosperity. Psalm. 116. 12,
13. Adversity. Job 1. 21. Lam. 3. 22.
Him alone as the Author of all good things. Iam. 1. 17.


This thankfulness is to be testified by glorifying him both in Word, giving
thanks. 1. These. 5. 18. Luke 2. 20. Psalm. 50. 23. Dee^, by doing those things
which are acceptable unto him. Psalm. 16. 2. Ioh. 15. 8.


Opp. Not delighting or rejoicing in God, nor in his Word: a sign that men
have not tasted how good the Lord is. 1. Pet. 2. 3. Delighting and rejoicing in
other things more than in the Lord: for what men love, that they delight in: as
worldly men in the fruition of worldly desires. Voluptuous me^ in their

And thus we are to fear the displeasure of God, in regard of the time Past,
because we have sinned, and by sin provoked the Lord to wrath. This terror

1. Cor. 11. 23. In the right use of the Lords Supper, there are duties
required in The Minister, that he administer it according to Christ's
institution: where consider What he is to administer, viz. The elements, both
Bread. Wine.
The Sacramental Word.
How, with such Sacramental rites and actions as were ordained by Christ. To
whom, to the faithful in profession at the least: And not to Profane persons.
Heretics, or exco^municat persons, Such as cannot prepare themselves.
To what end, that it might be a Sacrifice of praise to God. Memorial of
Christ's death. Means to confirm the faith of the receiver, etc.

The faithful among the people, viz. to Receive the Communion when it is
administered. Receive it worthily. Whereunto are duties required Before, viz.
due preparation, consisting in A trial of our selves, how we stand toward
God, in regard of our Knowledge. Faith. Repentance.
Neighbors, in regard of brotherly love.
Prayer, Confessing our sins, and wants. Desiring Gods blessing upon his own
ordinance.

At the Communion some thing is to be Considered: the sacramental union of the
sign, and the thing signified. Done, viz. the bread and the wine are to be
received with Faith. Thanksgiving, and showing ^orth the death of Christ.

Afterward, to Be thankful to God. Labor to feel the fruit and benefit of
the Sacrament. Perform y^ repentance, which in the time of our preparation we
either purposed or promised.





The Papists with hold the Cup from the people.

The Papists power water into their wine.

They mutter the words as a charm over the bread.

They use diverse gesticulations, partly Ridiculous. Idolatrous, as Elevation.
Adoration. Carrying about.
the Bread.


The Popish Priests distribute nothing to others, but are the only receivers
in their private Masses.

The Papists consecrate their Eucharist, that it may be Adored and carried
about in pomp, and not to be received. A sacrifice propitiatory for the quick
and the dead. An Idol which they worship in stead of Christ.


And these were the parts of Gods worship.

Now follow the Ad^uncts of Gods worship, as the Circumstances. Ceremonies.
Means thereof.


Concerning the circumstances belonging to Gods worship, and the ceremonies
therein to be used, we are to follow the general rules of Gods word, namely,
that all things be done To edification. 1. Cor. 14. 26. Decently. 1. Cor. 11.
13 1. Cor. 14. 40. According to order. 1. Cor.14.40.


The means of Gods worship, especially of Prayer, Fasting* see my Treatise
thereof. The Ministry of the Word and Sacraments, as the Preparation and
education of Ministers in schools of learning. 1. Sam. 10. 5. ^ 19. 20. 2.
King. 4. 38. Preservation and sufficient maintenance. Deuteronomy. 12. 19. 1. Tim. 5.
17. Gal. 6. 6, 7.



The third Commandment.
The Affirmative part, Commanding us to sanctify the name of God. Math. 6. 9.
Psalm. 29. 2.

The Negative part, Forbidding to take the name of God in vain; that is, to
profane it, or pollute it.

The special duties of sanctifying Gods name, are the usage of Gods name
holily, according to the several acceptance of Gods name, which signifies
either 1. God himself, and his attributes, which are himself. Joel 2. 32.
Deuteronomy. 28. 58. Exodus 33. 19. and 34. 5, 6, 7. That whereby he is named, that is,
2. Renowned: his name of renown, or glory. Exodus 9. 16. Psalm. 8. 1. Known,
as 3. His titles: as Jehovah, Iah, Lord, God, etc. Exodus 3. 15. Exodus 6. 3.
Means whereby he is known, which are either Peculiar to his Church, as the 4.
Word of God. Act. 9. 15 ^ 21. 13. 5. Religion of God, prescribed in his Word.
Mic. 4. 5. 1. King. 5 3, 5.
6. Common to all, as the works of God, for God is known by his works, as
men are by their names. Romans 1. 19, 20. Exodus 34. 7. Psa. 58. 11, 12. To. 1. 21.



After an especial manner, according to any almost of the former acceptations,
and that is, by swearing.


1. As the name of God signifies* God himself, and his attributes.

Thus we are to sanctify the name of God, in our Hearts, 1* Pet. 3. 14, 15.
by Thinking and conceiving of God and his attributes, holily and reverently.
Acknowledging, believing, and remembering effectually God and his attributes.
Mouths, by Confessing, and professing God and his attributes. Romans 10. 10. 1.
Pet. 3. 15. Speaking holily and reverently of God and his attributes.
Lives, by a conversation answerable to the effectual knowledge of God and his
attributes. Deuteronomy. 28. 58.


2. As the Name of God signifies his glory.

Thus we are to sanctify the name of God, by glorifying him in our Hearts, by
a true Desire of Gods glory. Purpose and intent thereof. Mal. 2. 2.
Mouths, by making the glory of God, both the Matter of our speech: for by
giving praise and thanks to God, we glorify him. Psalm. 50. 23. End of our
speech, by uttering Necessary truth. Josh. 7. 19. Col. 4. 6. Sauoury speeches.

Lives, by Doing all things to the glory of God. 1. Cor. 10. 31. Bringing forth
the fruits of good works: for thereby we Glorify God our selves. Ioh. 15. 8.
Cause others to glorify him. Math. 5. 12.




The special vices.

To entertain base, vnreuerent and ungodly thoughts, concerning God and his
attributes. Psalm. 50. 21. this is to blaspheme God in our hearts. Job. 1. 5.
Psalm. 14. 1. ^ 10. 11.

Not to know God, etc. effectually. Romans 2. 4, 5.

Not to confess God and his attributes before men. Math. 10. 33.

To speak of God, or his attributes Irreverently. Vnholily.
Psalm. 78. 19, 20. Exodus 5. 2.

Not to sanctify God in our lives. Numb. 20. 12. Tit. 1. 16.

Pride, and vainglory. Genesis 11. 4.

Neglect of Gods glory. Romans 1. 21.

To suppress the praises of God, and to be unthankful to him. Luke 17. 17.

To blaspheme the name of God. Leuit. 24. 11.

Opp. Truth Dissembled, or suppressed. Ioh. 9. 21. ^ 12. 42, 43. Denied. Mark.

By our sins, to Dishonor God. Romans 2. 23. Cause his name to be blasphemed.
Romans 2. 24. 2. Sam. 12. 14. Tit. 2. 5.


3. As the Name of God signifies his titles, which we use by taking them Up in
our mouths and writings. Upon us, when we are called after Gods name, and his
name is called upon in us. Genes. 4. 26. Esa. 43. 6, 7. Act. 11. 26.


We sanctify the Name of God in our speech and writings, when it is mentioned
In a matter serious. After a reverent manner. To a good end.


And hereunto is referred Blessing of God. Romans 9. 5. ^ 1. 25. 2. Cor. 11. 31.
Iam. 3. 9. Me^, which Generally is required of all. Mat. 5. 44. Romans 12. 14.

We sanctify the Name of God and of Christ our Savior, which we take upon us,
professing our selves Christians, and the children of God, when we walk
worthy our calling. Ephesians. 4. 1. Tit. 2. 10. 2. Tim. 2. 19. Ephesians. 5. 3.

Never to make mention of God, which is a sign that he is not in men's thoughts.

To mention it amiss, as In a matter light and ridiculous, as in sport. After
a manner Vnreuerent and careless. Superstitious.
To a wicked end, as to Charms and Exorcismes. Act. 19. 13. Wicked sentences,
which begin, In nomine Dei. Amen. Erroneous doctrines. Ierem. 23. 25.



Opp. Cursing. Romans 12. 14.

Salutation, Neglected in due time and place. Abused to Hypocrisy, where it is
not sincere and from the heart. Malicious purposes. 2. Sam. 20. 9. Mat. 26. 49.



Name of Christ, as it is taken upon men, profaned, Genesis 6. 2. which is a fault
either Common to all wicked persons which call themselves Christians. Peculiar
to the Jesuits, who under the name of Jesus, serve Antichrist.


4. As the Name of God does signify his Word.

This (to omit the holy and pure use of it, in the preaching and hearing
thereof, of which we spoke in ye 2. Com.) we are to sanctify in our Hearts, by
a holy Meditation thereof. Desire, study and care to know and practice it.
Psalm. 119. Words and writings, by applying it to those uses for which it is
profitable. 2. Tim. 3. 16. to our selves, or others, for the Information of the
judgment, by doctrine and confutation. Reforming of the life and affections,
by admonition, exhortation, reproof, consolation.
Deeds, by obeying it from our hearts. Romans 6. 17. Luke 11. 28. Ioh. 13. 17.


5. As the Name of God signifies his religion.

This are we to sanctify by a conversation answerable to the Religion which we
profess, Tit, 2. 11, 12. 13. Ephesians. 4. 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. ^ 5. 8, 10, 11.
This being the right way, Esa. 30. 21. Act. 9. 2. we are to walk in it, Mic.
4. 5. and that Uprightly, in respect of God. Psalm. 119. 1. Gal. 2. 14. Genesis 17.
1. Inoffe^siuely, in respect of men. 1. Cor. 10. 32. Heb. 12. 13. Phil. 1. 10.
Act. 24. 14, 15, 16.


The Word of God is profaned in the Heart, when we have neither desire to know
it, nor care to keep it. Words and writings, when it is abused to uses either
Vain and unprofitable, as when it is read in an unknown language, or so sung,
that it cannot be understood. Psalm. 47. 7. Evil, in respect of Judgment, as
for the Confutation of the truth. Confirmation of errors.
Manners, as to Impenitency. Psa. 50. 16, 17. Scoffs and jests. Charms and
enchantments. Deuteronomy. 18. 11, 12.


Deeds, when we do not observe it to do it, Leuit. 22. 31, 32. either through
Neglect. Malac. 1. 12. Amos 2. 7. Prou. 30. 9. Contempt, which is a kind of
blasphemy. Number. 15. 30, 31.



Thus y^ name of God is taken in vain, when our co^uersatio^ is not agreeable
to our profession: as when me^ walk in respect of God, in hypocrisy, 2. Tim.
3 5. pretending the profession of religion to their Worldly respects. Phil. 3.
18, 19. Wicked respects. Mat. 23. 14. 1. King. 21. 9. 2. Sam. 15. 8. Math. 2. 8.
Me^, offensiuely: and thus the name of God is profa^^d by the Dissolute and
wicked life of carnall-gospellers. Romans 2. 24. Offenses of the godly, 2. Sam.
12. 14. and those y^ would seem forward professors.



6. As the Name of God signifies his works, both of Creation, in respect
whereof he is called the Creator. Administration, in regard whereof he is
called the Governor and Judge of the world.


The works of Creation or creatures, we are to sanctify by a Holy meditation
and mentioning of them, to Gods glory, that we In them may acknowledge the
wisdom, power and goodness of God. Romans 1. 19, 20. Psalm. 19. 1. Knowing him
by his works, may glorify him as God. Romans 1. 21. Acknowledging in the^ the
workmanship of God, may speak honorably thereof. Psa. 139. 14. Genesis 1. 3 1.
Our good, that what the Scripture has taught us in the^ to Imitate, we may
follow. Math. 6. 26, 28. Prou. 6. 6. Avoid, we may shun. Psalm. 32. 9. Ierem.
5. 8. 2. Pet. 2. 22.

Pure use, sanctified by The Word. Prayer.
1. Tim. 4. 5


Opp. In respect of Gods glory, Not to acknowledge God by his creatures.
Knowing him by them, not to glorify him as God. To deprave or deride (like
Mo^us) the works of God.
In regard of our good, to imitate that in them, which the Scriptures teach us
to shun.


Opp. To the use sanctified by the Word, is the use Without, or besides the
Word, being Scrupulous. Romans 14. 23. Superstitious, Ascribing sanctification to
them, as, to holy water, salt, candles, bells. Abusing them to divination. Deuteronomy
18. 10. Esa. 47. 13. Ier. 10. 2.

Contrary to the Word, abusing them as instruments unto sin, as our bodies to
fornication, our meat and drink, to surfeiting and drunkenness.
Prayer, the profane use, without Craving Gods blessing in the use. Returning
thanks to God the giver of them.



The works of administration, (which in a general sense are called the
judgments of God) are exercised in Determining doubts, which by men cannot
sufficiently be decided, viz. Lots, Prou 16. 33. as in Deciding controversies.
Pro. 18. 18. Elections. 1. Sam. 10. 21, 24. Act. 1. 23. Dividing inheritances.
Numb. 26. 55. Finding out a secret offe^dor. Josh. 7. 14.
Lots are purely used, when we Call upon God for his direction, referring our
selves to his judgment. Act. 1. 24. Rest well pleased in the sentence of God.
Assigning Rewards and blessings, hereof we are to have a pure use, whether
bestowed upon Our selves: that is, to be thankful for them, and to testify
our tha^kfulnes, by Words, in Giving thanks. Psalm. 124. 6. ^ 86. 12, 13.
Declaring Gods benefits. Ps. 66. 16. 71. 8, 18.
Deed, by Referring the^ to Gods glory, and the good of our brethren. Luke 19.
13. Being moved to repentance thereby. Romans 2. 4.

Others: viz. to Rejoice with them. 1. Cor. 12. 26 Praise God for them. Psalm.
35. 27. Gal. 1. 23.

Punishments and crosses, which more specially are called judgments: whereof also
we are to have a pure use, whether laid on Our selves, to Be humbled under
the hand of God. Job 1. Patiently and thankfully to bear them Job 1. To learn
obedience by that we suffer. Heb. 5. 8.
Others, to Be terrified (by their example) from sin. Josh. 22. 20. 1. Cor.
10. 6. Romans 11. 20, 21. Condole with y^ faithful. To. 12. 15 Magnify the
justice of God in punishing the wicked Psalm. 58. 11, 12. Judge. 5. 31.





Lots abused, in Casting of fortunes. The game called Lottery. Those games of
Dice and Cards, etc. which wholly consist in chance: for in toys and sports
we are not to appeal to the immediate judgment of God. Prou. 16. 33.


Not to be thankful to God for his benefits.

Not to testify our thankfulness: but rather to Assume the praise to our
selves. Abuse Gods blessings to His dishonor. Harm of others. Impenitency.



To envy the graces of God in others.

Not to be humbled under the hand of God. Ier. 5. 3. Esa. 22. 12, 13.

To be impatient, and to murmr.

To be incorrigible. Esa. 1. 5. Ier. 2. 30.

Not to be warned by the judgments of God upon others. Dan. 5. 22. but rather
to be pleased with our selves, that we are not so afflicted. Luke 13. 1, 2, 3.

To rejoice at the afflictions of others. Job 31. 29.

Of Oaths.

1. In general.

The Name of God is to be sanctified by a lawful Oath.

Where consider two things: First, that we are to swear upon just occasion.
Deuteronomy. 6. 13. Psalm. 63. 11. Esa. 45. 23.

Secondly, that we swear lawfully.

Duties required in a lawful Oath, respect the Object: for we are to swear by
the Lord alone, Esa. 65. 16. Ierem. 12. 6. Either Directly. Indirectly, the
invocation and attestatio^ referred to God, though something else be named.
Manner, for we are to swear* Ier 4. 2. in Truth, Romans 9. 1. that is, To that
which is true. Truly, Exanimi sententia. 2. Chr. 15. 15.
Righteousness, promising by Oath lawful things only. Judgment, Discerning
the necessity of our Oath, in respect of the Person Imposing it. Not believing a
necessary truth, without it.
Thing, which cannot otherwise be proved. End, for Gods glory. The good of Our
selves. Others.


Duly weighing the conditions and circumstances. Genesis 24. 5. Josh. 2. 17, 18,
19.

End, for we are so to swear, that God may have glory by the manifestation, or
confirmation of a necessary (but hidden) truth, which otherwise could not be
demonstrated* Josh. 7. 19. Our neighbor may be satisfied, controversies may be
ended. Heb. 6. 16. Our own innocence cleared, Exodus 22. 11. and ou^ duty
discharged. 1. King. 8. 31.



To refuse altogether to swear, with the Anabaptists.

To swear unlawfully.

To swear by any thing besides God, Ier. 5. 7. Zeph. 1. 5. using Oaths
Ridiculous: as By Lakin, etc. Pharisaicall, by creatures, as Light, Fire, etc.
Popish, as by Saints: Mary, John, etc. Idols, as Mass. Rood.

Amos 8. 14. Heathenish, by the gods of the Gentiles, 1. King. 19. 2. Mebercle,
Medius Fidius, etc. Blasphemous, as by all the parts and members of Christ.


Opp. to swear To that which is false. Leuit. 19. 12. Falsely, with a mind to
dece^ue Ps. 24. 4.


To swear to an unlawful thing, which either Is apparently unlawful at the
ti^e of the Oath. 1 Samuel 25. 21, 3^. ^ 28. 10. Afterward proves to be
unlawful. Mark. 6. 23, 25.


Opp. To swear Without necessity, as they use to do, who swear ordinarily
and commonly: this is to p^ll^te the Name of God, and to make that common,
which he has sanctified and extolled above all things. Math. 5. 37. Iam. 5.
12. Ecclus. 23. 8. Rashly and unadvisedly. Leuit. 5. 4. 1. Sam. 14 39, 44. as
those which swear in heat and choler.


To swear to No end, vainly, and through a foolish custom, without regard of
Gods glory, or good of their brethren, or discharge of their duty. An ill end,
as For a bravery, that they may glory in their shame, and garnish their speech
with the pollution of Gods Name. To falsify the truth, and to win credit to a
falsehood.



2. In special.

There are two distinction of Oaths.

1. An Oath is either Assertory, wherein some truth, is avouched, and that, if
it be Certain and known, simply that it is so. Supposed, according to our
opinion, that we think so.
Promissory, whereby we truly promise some lawful thing which is in our power,
calling upon God not only as our witness and Judge, but also as our surety,
that we will perform it. Here four things are required: 1. That the thing be
lawful. 2. That it is, and will be in our power. 3. That we have a true and
unfeigned purpose to perform it. 4. That we do indeed perform it, Number. 30.
2. though to our own hinderance. Psalm. 15. 4.



2. An Oath is either Public. Private.


Opp. To avouch that to be True, which we know to be false. Certain, which we
know not to be true.


Opp. To promise by Oath y^ which 1. Is not lawful, which is to sin with an
high hand, and with a desperate resolution to do ill. 2. Is not in our power,
which either Appears so at the first; and so cannot be promised by Oath, without
extreme profanesse. Proves so afterward; and therefore cannot be promised
simply, without great rashness.
3. We do not mean to perform: which is to swear deceitfully. Psalm. 24. 4.
4. Which we do not perform, being a thing lawful, and in our own power;
and this properly is called Perjury.


But if it be Impossible, our Oath does not bind us. Unlawful, we are bound to
break it: otherwise we add sin to a sin.


In public Oaths consider the duty of him that Imposes it, viz. that he so
impose it, as that the Oath may be taken in Truth. Judgment. Righteousness.
Deposes: that the consideration of the public pla^e for seat of judgment,
make him y^ more reverently and circumspectly perform the general duties,
both in Oaths Assertory. Promissory.



A private Oath may be taken only upon necessity. Mat. 5. 37. for what is
redundant, above yea or nay, in our ordinary talk or communication, is of
evil: and consequently private Oaths must be rare and in season.

To Promissory Oaths we are to refer Vows, which are promissory Oaths, made
to God voluntarily concerning the performance of some certain thing which may
be acceptable to God, either for the confirmation of our faith in prayer, or
for the strengthening of our resolution in the performance of some good thing
which we purpose.

Duties required in Vows, belong either to the Making Performing
of them. Psalm. 76. 11. Esa. 19. 21.

Those which belong to the making of a vow, concern the Object, which is God
alone, Psalm. 76. 11. Manner. A. End. B.


Opp. To impose an Oath, When it is not necessary. Upon men of no credit, who
make no conscience of an Oath. In matters of no moment. Tumultuously and in
haste. Injuriously, especially in a capital cause, to make the party accuse
himself. Against his conscience, when he knows that it Is false. Will not
be performed.



Opp. To depose in an Oath Assertory, contrary to conscience, for Malice.
Favor. Hire.
1. King 21. 13. Mark. 14. 56. Promissory, contrary to a man's purpose: as when
being chosen to public places, or admitted into societies, men take Oaths,
only because it is the custom and manner that they should swear, not because
they mean to keep their Oath.


To swear in our communication, Without necessity, Rashly. Profanely. Ier. 23.
10. Ordinarily and commonly.


The Papists vow to Saints, both Themselves: as to Augustine, Francis,
Dominick, etc. as the Nazarites were wont to vow themselves to God. Numb. 6.
Other things; as Oblations, and Pilgrimages, etc.


A. Manner, for it must be made in Truth, and therefore must be Sincere. 2.
Chron. 15. 15. Voluntary. Deuteronomy. 23. 23.
Righteousness, both in respect of the Person vowing, that either he Be his
own man. Have the consent of his governor. Numb. 30.
Thing vowed, that it be lawful and acceptable to God: as Things good and
commanded: of such, Vows are made. Absolutely, which are renewings of our Vow in
Baptism. With restraint of circumstances: as to give so much alms weekly; or
to pray so often daily, etc.
The use, or forbearance of things indifferent, as we have found the same
profitable or hurtful to us.

Judgment, so as the party clearly discern it to be a thing, 1. lawful and
acceptable unto God: 2. in our power, either naturally, or by the assistance of
Gods grace promised to us: 3. profitable.


B. End of the Vow, which is, to confirm our Faith in prayer. 1. Sam. 1. 11.
Resolution in good things.
Thing vowed, which must be referred to the Glory of God, as Vows
Eucharisticall, sacrifices of praise, gifts to be bestowed to godly uses. Ps.
66. 13, 14. ^ 61. 8. ^ 132. 2, 5. Leuit 27. 16. Genesis 28. 20, 21. Good of our
brethren: as Vows of charity and mercy toward the poor. Our profit: as the
Vows of Sobriety, of fasting and abstinence. Repentance, as of Hu^bling our
souls. Nu. 30. 14 Amending our lives, in Forsaking our sins with the occasions
thereof. Stirring up our selves to the performance of our duties.






Opp. Vows Hypocritical: when men do not truly purpose to perform them:
such as hypocrites make in the time of adversity, to deceive God. Psalm. 78. 36.
Forced: as of some young persons, which against their will are thrust into
Monasteries, and made to vow single life.


The Vows of children entering into a Monastery, against the will of their
parents, are held firm among Papists: as Mat. 15. 5, 6.

Opp. To vow things either Simply evil. Evil to us.
Such are Monastical Vows.

Opp. To vow that which either is not, or we know it not to be Lawful and
acceptable to God. Deuteronomy. 23. 18. as the Vow of voluntary poverty. In our own
power: as the Vow of single life, in them that have not the gift of continency.
Profitable, as going on Pilgrimages, etc.


Vows therefore indefinitely conceived, (as that of Iephthe, Judge. 11. 31.)
are unlawful, because we know not whether they will be lawful, in our power,
or profitable.

Opp. To vow with the Papists, such things as serve neither for the Glory of
God, but To superstitious and idolatrous ends. For their own glory, with
opinion of merit.
Profit of their neighbor, but contrary thereto, as the Vow of Monastical
obedience, making them renounce all duty to parents, and service to their
country. Voluntary poverty, making them drones, etc.
Good of themselves, as y^ Vow of continency, from whence all the uncleanness
and incontinency of the Popish Clergy proceeds.


As touching the performance of Vows, the Scripture requires that we should
perform them, or else we commit a sin, as bad, or worse than Perjury, Number.
30. 3. and that without Delay. Eccles. 5. 3, 4. Deuteronomy. 23. 21. Diminution. Number.
30 3. Deuteronomy. 23. 23.


Provided always, that the thing vowed be Lawful. In our power.
Otherwise we have sinned in vowing, but we are not bound to the performance.

No hing does bind the conscience, which is against the Word of God.

Vows are of 2. sorts: some Common to all Christians, as the Vow in Baptism,
whereby we consecrated our selves to God, and is more carefully to be
performed. Proper to several men, and it is either a Renewing of the common
Vow, which is needful to be done, when men come to years of discretion. New
Vow, concerning Certain things commanded, with limitation of circumstances.
Things indifferent, to be used or refused, as we have found them by
experience to be profitable or hurtful for us.




Not to perform lawful Vows, being in our power.

To use delay, which argues unwillingness.

To perform it by the halues, which argues doubling, as in Ananias and
Saphyra. Act. 5.

To think our selves bound to perform unlawful or impossible Vows. Judge.
11. 35, 39.

To pretend we cannot perform the Vow of Baptism, and such like lawful
Vows, when we will not.

Not to perform the Vow of Baptism, or those whereby it is renewed:

Or any other lawful or profitable Vow, which is in our power to perform, if
we will.

The fourth Commandment.
The Affirmative part,
Commanding us to remember the Sabbath to sanctify it. Esa. 56. 2.

Whence two things are to be considered: 1. That we must sanctify the
Sabbath. 2. That we must be mindful and careful of it to sanctify it.


To the sanctification of the Sabbath two things are required: viz. Rest, which
is signified in the word Sabbath. The sanctifying of that rest.


The rest which is required, is partly Outward, from bodily labors, and
worldly business. Verse. 9. 10. Inward, from the servile works of sin.


Of the outward Rest, 3. things to be considered: 1. Why it is required, viz.
as a remedy against distraction. 2. From what works: viz. works of our own,
and servile works, as Buying and selling. Neh. 13. 15. Carrying of burdens.
Ierem. 17. 22. Iourneys. Exodus 16. 29. etc.
3. How far forth works are forbidden: viz. As they are means of
distraction, and hindrances of the entire sanctification of the Sabbath. Not as
they are referred either to the means, or works of sanctification. To the
Means, as the Labors of the Ministers, in and about their ministry. Math.
12. 5. Travel of the people to the places of Gods worship. 2. King 4. 23.
Works, as the duties of mercy and charity: as to heal the sick; to help a
woman in travel, etc. Math. 12. 7, 12. Hos. 6. 6.
Nor as they are works of necessity. Mat. 12. 1. to 19. Of necessity I say,
Present, so as they could not have been done before, nor may be done
afterward. Sanctified, not contracted, through our own negligence.




The Negative part,
Forbidding the profanation of the Sabbath.

Opp. The Extremes, in Excess: a Jewish and superstitious observation of the
outward rest, preferring it before either the means, or works of
sanctification. Mat. 12. 1, 2. Mark. 3. 2. Luke 13. 14. Ioh. 9. 14, 16. 1. Mac.
2. 38. Defect: the neglect of the outward rest, following of bodily labors and
worldly business. Exodus 34. 21. ^ 31. 13, 14.
Abuse of rest, to Idleness: when rest is not used as a means, but men rest
in it as the end; which is worse than bodily labor. Sabbathum Asino^um.
Vanity, in profane sports and pastimes, which more distract, and more hinder
our works than honest labors. Esa. 58. 13. Sabbathum Tituli. Exodus 32. 6, 18,
19. Sin, as to gluttony, drunkenness, whoredom, etc. Sabbathum Satanae.



By necessity therefore are excused, the necessary Labor in provision of food.
Tending of cattle. Mat. 12. 11 Labors of Mariners, being before the Sabbath on
y^ sea. Fight for defense of our Country. 1. Mac. 2. 41. Labors of servants,
and subjects, enjoined by their masters, and Magistrates, etc.


Mark. 2. 27. The Sabbath was made for man.

The inward and spiritual rest from sin. For as we are to rest from sin
every day (that in this life we may begin our eternal Sabbath, Heb. 4. 9.
10.) so especially on the Sabbath. Esa. 56. 2. ^ 58. 13.

These works are chiefly forbidden, as being especially Servile works,
whereby men serve the devil. Our own works.


Now follows the sanctification of the Rest, by Using the means Doing the
works
of sanctification.

The Sabbath is to be sanctified, both Publicly. Privately.


The public sanctification consists in Using the means of sanctification in
the worship of God. Wherewe are to consider the duty of y^ Ministers, who are
to be the chief actors in the public sanctification of the Sabbath: their
duty is to Call upon God in behalf of the people. Read and preach the Word.
Administer the Sacraments at convenient times, and as occasion is offered.
People, To vouchsafe their presence in the assembly, Leuit. 19. 30. 67. ^ 23.
2. Coming duly. Staying to the end.
Being present, to behave themselves religiously and uprightly (as has been
showed in the second Commandment) in Hearing the Word. Calling on ye name of
God. The use of y^ Sacraments.


Doing the works of sanctification: as namely, in collections for the poor.
1. Cor. 16. 2.


Opp. Not to rest from sin, which makes the observation of the outward rest,
odious unto God. Esa 1. 13, 14, 15. Amos 5. 21.

Opp. In the Ministers, Careless Non-residency Idleness.
People, Absence, upon no just cause, through Negligence. Mat. 22. 5. Luke 14.
18, 19, 20. Contempt and obstinacy, as in Recusants, whether Heretics, as
Papists, etc. Schismatics, as Brownists. Heb. 10. 25.

Departure without any necessary cause. Irreligious and hypocritical behavior
in the worship of God.



The Sabbath is also to be sanctified privately.

The private sanctification consists in duties, which either have reference
to the public sanctification, and those either Going before, as preparation by
Meditation. Prayer.
Following, as Meditation of the Word heard. Application of it to our use.
Conference with others, if we be not alone, etc.

Severally are required, as Means of sanctification, as Reading. Meditation of
Gods Word. Works of Creation. Redemption by Christ.
Invocation by Prayer. Thanksgiving, and singing of Psalms. Ps. 92. 1
Godly conference.

Works of sanctification: as y^ works of mercy. Outward: as Almes^giuing,
visiting the sick, etc. Inward and spiritual* as to Teach the ignorant.
Reclaim the erroneous. Admonish the backward. Exhort and stir up one another.
Rebuke the offendour. Comfort the distressed. Give counsel to them which need
it, or seek it. Reconcile them which be at variance, etc.





To neglect the private sanctification of the Sabbath, mis-spending the time in
Worldly (...). Idleness. Vanity. Sin, etc.


2. We are to remember, or (as Deuteronomy. 5. 12.) to observe the Sabbath that we may
sanctify it.

Where are duties required, both Before: so to cast our business beforehand,
and so to dispose of our affairs and iourneyes, etc. that on the Sabbath we
shall not need to be distracted with bodily labors, or worldly business. On
the Sabbath, studiously to observe it, that is, both Seriously and soundly, as
the words import. Willingly and with delight. Esa. 58. 13.



To the weekly Sabbath, we are to add all other Sabbaths, lawfully ordained
by the Church; all which are to be consecrated as Sabbaths to the Lord, whether
they be Ordinary and Anniuersary, such as were the feast of Purim. Hest. 3. 7.
^ 9. 21. The Dedication. 1. Macca. 4. 59. Ioh. 10. 22.
Are the feasts of Christ's Nativity, Resurrection, Ascension, and Pentecost.
Extraordinary, which are Sabbaths of ^oy and thanksgiving. Neh. 8. 9, 10.
Humiliation. Joel 1. 14. ^ 2. 15. 2. Chr. 20. 3.



Opp. To be mindful of the Sabbath to profane it: as those who having any
extraordinary business, will not bestow any part of the week upon it, but
will reserve it for the Sabbath; and make bold with God to borrow part of his
day, etc.

To observe the Sabbath for fashion sake, keeping the outward Rest only,
putting on gay clothes, and doing nothing.

To be weary of the Sabbath, and to wish it were gone. Amos 8. 5.

The not observing of Sabbaths lawfully ordained by the Church, either through
Neglect. Contempt.


The mis-spending of them, (which fault is common, especially in the Feast of
Christ's Nativity) to vanity and sin.

place and dwelling, as the word is commonly used: but also in nature, as every
man is, being made of the same blood, Act. 17. 26. the same flesh, Esa. 58. 7.
after the same image of God, Genesis 9. 6. Howbeit of this love there are degrees,
Gal. 6. 10. 1. Tim. 5. 8. Genesis 2. 24. Manner, as thy self, Mat. 7. 12 that is,
as thou ought to love thy self, in regard both of the love Natural,
whereby thou des^est thine own good and safety, as the preservation of thy
Life, and health. Wives chastity. Goods. Good name, etc.

Leuit. 19. 13. 1. These. 4. 6. Luke 3. 14. 1. Cor. 6. 10.

Theft is to be distinguished according to the difference of the Manner, that
it is Manifest, when the thief is taken with the manner: that is, either In

Persons which do steal, for it is either Domestical, as the theft of the
Wife. Children. Prou. 28. 24. Deuteronomy. 21. 20. Servants. Tit. 2. 10. Math. 24. 49.

Robbery or Rapine is distinguished by the end: for thereby is intended, either
the Neighbors harm, which is spoiling; as in those who are called
Incendiarij, who maliciously set on fire their neighbors houses, or corn.
Venefici, who spoil men's goods or cattle, by Poison. Charms, Enchantments,
Witchcraft.

Robbers own profit or gain: and is committed either Under pretense of
authority by great thieves, and is called Oppression: and that is by
Usurpation, without color of Law. Genesis 21. 25. Judge. 18. 25. 27. Extortion,
under color of Law. Psalm. 94. 20. Luke 19. 8.

To these sorts of thieves and robbers, we are to adioyne those that be

At the time, by helping and assisting them. After, by receiving the Thieves.

Now follows the acquisition or getting, which is by Contract, which is the
consent between parties, concerning the alienation or permutation of things
upon condition, and that condition is either Presently performed, For the time
to come, assured by obliga^^o^s Verbal, wether by Word of mouth. Writing, a^
Bills. Bonds.

guile, as in the sight of God, Psalm. 15. 2, 4. observing in our Words, truth.
Zac. 8. 16. Promises, faithfulness. Deeds, justice.


Contracts are concerning Alienation of things for A time: Ever:
and both of them either Free. For reco^pe^ce
Committing to trust.


The free alienation for a time, is either of the Use only, which is
commodation or lending to use, the property retained. Property also, which is
mutuation or lending to spend; and has place in things which are spent in the
use.


In things lent to use, the duty of ye borrower is to Use the same to that end
for which it was lent, and not to abuse it. Restore y^ same particular Safe and

In things lent to be spent, the duty of the Lender, is to intend and seek the
borrowers good, and not his own gain. Surety, if there be any, to give his
word for those that be thrifty and honest, and to make good his word. Borrower
toward the Surety, to save him harmless. Creditor, to restore the
principal, In the full value. At ye time appointed.




The free alienation which is perpetual, is Donation, and is here considered
as it is made, with Condition, and not absolutely. Limitation of certain
Duties, services,
which the receiver is bound to perform.


The alienation which is for recompense, is a commutation, wherein equality is
to be observed betwixt the things committed.

In these contracts out Do vt des: Do vt facias, vel contra,
that is, there is a commutation either of things themselves, or their use, Men's
labor and industry,
for an equal recompense.

Opp. In the Lender, to lend for gain, which is Usury: to which sin, are

especially offend, who are voluntary Banquerupts.


Opp. Inequality in illiberall contracts.

The commutation of the things themselves, is either of Ware for ware, which is
Bartery, Money for money, which is Exchange. Ware for money, which is Selling:
wherein is required as touching the Person, that he be the right owner, or
authorized by him. Thing, y^ it be saleable, in respect of the Substance. Use.
Price, that is be just and equal. Manner of selling, that it be without

20. Pardon of sin. Justice, by Bribery. Untruths, as False witnesses.
Lawyers, who be Patrons of bad causes.
Liberality and time, as Usurers do.
Money-worth, being in respect of the Substance, counterfeit, or corrupt. Amos
8. 6. Use, unprofitable, or hurtful.

Price, being unequal: in which respect they chiefly offend, even as public
thieves, whose practice is, to raise the prices of things, as Regraters.
Forestallers. Ingrosers. Dardanarij, Hucksters, and whorders up of commodities,
to cause a dearth. Prou. 11. 26.
Manner, when me^ use deceitful Words, Flattering the buyer. Praising the ware
unworthily, and concealing or extenuating the faults thereof, not lessening the
price.
Deeds, in respect of the Kind, giving one for another. Quality, that the ware

In buying, regard is to be had of the Person, of whom thou buyest, that he
have right to sell. Thing, that it be a thing which is valuable by money, and
may be lawfully bought with money. Price, that thou give, and if thou have
knowledge, that thou offer an equal price: and if he sell for need, to give
rather more, than less than the worth. Manner, that it be void of all deceit
and wrong.


Opp. In regard of the Person, to buy of him that has no right to sell: as to
buy stolen goods. Thing, to buy that, which either Cannot be valued by money,
as The graces of God: which properly is Symonie. Act. 8. 18, 19. Remission of
sin: as those which buy Pardons. Holy orders, etc.
Ought not to be bought or sold for money, as Presentations unto Benefices,
which also are called Symony. Injustice, of a Judge corrupted by thee. False

Number, as to deceive in the tale, to give 9. pence, for 12. pence, or 7.
shillings 6. pence, for 10. shillings, etc.





To the former contracts we are to refer oppignoration, which is a contract
partly of Lending and borrowing upon a pawn. Buying and selling, if the
condition be not observed.


The duty of the giver of the Pawn is, not to deceive the taker, in the worth
thereof.

The duty of the lender upon a pawn is, to provide only for his indemnity: as
if he have to deal with a needy brother, either to Take None of him. Such
only as he may well spare. Ex. 22. 26. Deuteronomy. 24. 6, 10, 11, 12, 13.
Restore it presently.


The contract which concerns the alienation of the use for hire, has two
parts: Location or letting to hire. Conduction or taking to hire.


The duty of him that lets to hire, is to Let that only which has a
fruitful use, which may be severed from the property, which he reserueth to
himself. Require an hire proportionable to that use, the impairing, hazard,
and charge also being considered. Let that which is fit for the use to which it
is let. Bear the hazard, if it miscarry without the hirers default. Exodus 22.
15.


The duty of the hirer, is to Use the thing hired, only to that end for which
it was let. Restore it at the time appointed. Restore it entire, of if it has
miscarried through his default, to make it good. Exodus 22. 12.


Opp. In the Borrower, to lay a pawn of less value than the sum which is
borrowed, with purpose to forfeit the same. Lender, To seek gain, by Taking
the fruitful use of the thing in respect of the loan; which is a spice of
Usury: Antichresis. The forfeiture, providing not only for his indemnity.
To take a pawn of a needy brother, which he cannot well spare, and not to
restore it presently. Ezech. 18. 7, 12. ^33. 15.



Opp. To let that which has no fruitful use, but is spent in the use; which
is usury under pretense of letting. To require an unreasonable hire, and to
take advantage of the hire^s necessity. To let that which is unfit for the use
to which it is let. To exact a recompense above covenant, for some harm which
has happened to the thing let, without the hirers fault.


Opp. To abuse that which is hired, to other purpose. Not to restore it. Not to
make it good, having by his default impaired or spoiled it.


Contracts, wherein is a commutation of men's skill, industry and labor for an
equal stipend or reward, may be referred to the Contract of Location and
conduction.

The duty of him that hireth another man's labor, is to Allow him an equll
stipend. 1. Tim. 5. 18. Give it him, if he be poor, without delay. Leuit. 19.
13. Deuteronomy. 24. 14, 15.


The duty of him that is hired, is to Require a stipend proportionable. Employ
his labor and skill faithfully, and diligently. Genesis 31. 6, 39, 40.


To this head are to be referred the fees and duties of Lawyers, Physicians*
Chirurgians, Schoolmasters, and of all Artificers and Tradesmen, who employ
their labor or skill for recompense.

Now follow those contracts wherein are committed to trust either Things.
Persons.


Things, as goods committed to Depositaries, (to whom sequesters are to be
referred) whose duty is to Keep them safe. Restore them to the owner,
demanding them. Make them good, if by his default they be impaired or lost.
Exo. 22. 10, 11, 12.
Feoffees of trust, Executors, who are faithfully to discharge that trust
reposed in them.


Opp. Not to allow an equal stipend to men for then labor. To detain the
poor man's hire. Iam. 5. 4.


Opp. To require an unreasonable allowance. To deal Negligently. Unfaithfully.



Opp. To use the things committed to their trust, (by which use they are
impaired) or to turn them to their own profit. Not to restore them,
especially committed to their trust in a tumultuous time: as in fear of fire.
Not to make them good, having impaired or spoiled them.


Opp. In Feoffees and Executors, to deal unfaithfully.

Persons committed to trust, are Pupils, or Orphans, committed to Tutors and
Guardians.

Whose duty is, 1. To remember, that they are set over Orphans, not for their
own, but for the Orphans good. 2. As they succeed the natural parents in
authority, so they ought to succeed them in fatherly affection. Hest. 2 7.


The other branch of just possession, is just keeping: which contains two
things, the Preserving and retaining of our own goods. Restoring of that which
is other men's.


We are bound to preserve our goods, as being Talents committed to us of God,
and not to Neglect them, or to expose the^ (as it were) to pilserers and
stealers. Suffer them to be spoiled or lost. Ioh. 6. 12.
which are the opposite vices.

Quest. Whether for retaining our goods, and maintaining our right, it be
lawful to go to Law?

Answ. It may be lawful (though most men offend in going to law,) if these
cautions be observed, viz. that 1. The cause be just, weighty and necessary.
2. Charity be not broken. 3. It be used as the last refuge.


Restitution of other men's goods, which either Have been unlawfully gotten.
Cannot lawfully be retained.


Opp. Not to seek the Orphans, but their own profit. To make a prey of them,
and to use them not as children, but rather as slaves which are bought and sold.


Opp. To go to law, For causes Trifling. Unjust.
In stomach and malice. Not as the last remedy, but as present means to molest
our neighbor.


Opp. To persist in the wrong, by not restoring.

Opp. To detain them against the owners will.

Concerning restitution of things unlawfully gotten, these 5. points are to be
considered, viz. 1. That restitution is to be made. Leuit. 6. 4. 5. Number. 5. 6,
7, 8. 1. Sam. 12. 4. Luke 19. 8. Mat. 27. 3. Ezech. 33. 14, 15. 2. Who is to
make restitution: viz. every one that has unjustly got, whether by force or by
fraud, or by any unjust means whatsoever. 3. To whom? viz. to the party
damnified, Leuit. 6. 5. or if he be dead, to those who are next of kin,
Numb. 5. 7, 8. or for want of them, let him give it to good uses. 4. How much?
the full value at the least, Leuit. 6. 5. Numb. 5. 7. Luke 19. 8. or if he be
not able, yet so much as he can. Exodus 22. 3. 5. When? so soon as he seeks
forgiveness at the hands of God. Number. 5. 6, 7, 8. Leuit. 6. 2. etc. Mal. 5.
23, 24.


Restitution also is to be made of such things, as having come lawfully to our
hands, cannot lawfully be detained against the owners good will, we being able
to restore them: and these are things which either we have Found, which we
must esteem as committed to our trust, by the Lord, that we may restore them
to the true owner, if he can possibly be known. Exodus 23. 4. Deuteronomy. 22. 2, 3.
Received by contract, as things Ali^nated for a time; as things le^t, let, or
l^d to paw^e. Psalm. 37. 21. Ezech. 18. 12. Committed to our trust. Leu. 6. 2, 4.



Now follows the right use of our goods toward Our selves, which is the
fruition of them. Others, which is the free communication of the^.
Prou. 5. 15, 16.

We are to enjoy and to use to our comfort, the good gifts of God. Eccl. 5. 17,
18. and heereto belong 2. virtues Parsimony in the honest saving and sparing of
things, that they be not idly and unprofitably wasted or spent. Prou. 27. 23,
24, 25, 26, 27. Frugality, in the sober and moderate spending of our goods,
according to our calling and ability, to profitable and needful uses. Sit
condus fortior promo.


To the free communication of goods to the good of others, Prou. 21. 21. two
virtues are required: Liberality, that we communicate them willingly, and
cheerfully. Justice, that we give of our own, without doing wrong to others.


Free communication of goods, is either for A time, by lending. Psalm. 112. 5.

Opp. Niggardliness, which keeps men not only from communicating of goods,
but also from enjoying them. Eccl. 6. 2. ^ 4. 8. Ecclus. 14. 3, 4, 5, 6. and is

The fruits of this care are referred either to the Fame it self, and that
either Good: to be glad to hear well of our neighbors. Romans 1. 8. Col. 1. 3,
4. Bad: to be sorry for it.
Means, as Hearing. Judging. Reporting.

Reporting, to blaze abroad the secret faults of others; especially such as are
sins of infirmity, Prou. 10. 18.


Thus much of the inward disposition: now follows the outward profession:

for every testimony concerning thy neighbor, must be both True. Charitable.


Testimonies are either Public, and those either Forensia, in place of
judgment, as the testimony of the Judge. Notary. Parties which go to Law.
Lawyers and Advocates. Witnesses.
Or otherwise out of the place of judgment.
Private.


The testimony of y^ Judge, is the sentence which he pronounces, whereto is
required Before hand, a full trial and examination of the cause. Deuteronomy. 13. 14.
^ 17. 4. ^ 19. 18. Genesis 18. 21. In the delivery thereof, that he judge
according to Truth. Exodus 18. 21. Justice. Leuit. 19. 15. Deuteronomy. 1. 16. ^ 16.
20. Equity.



Judges must also take heed, that they be not accessory to the false witness
of others, by Admitting needless suits. Protracting of suits. Rash imposing of
Oaths.


Opp. Testimonies False, being either Simply false. 1. King. 21. 13. In show of
words true, but false in sense. Math. 26. 60, 61. with Ioh. 2. 19.
Uncharitable and malicious. 1. Sam. 22. 9.


Opp. Judgment either Rash, when it is pronounced: 1. The cause not well
understood by the Judge. Prou. 18. 13. 2. The party not heard to speak in his
own defense. Act. 25. 15, 16. 3. One side only being heard. 2. Sam. 16. 4.
Prou. 18. 17. 4. Upon the witness of one alone, in a capital cause. Deuteronomy. 17.
6.
Perverse, wherein the wicked is absolved, and the righteous condemned, Prou.
17. 15. which commonly happens, because the Judge is either a Taker of
Bribes. Deuteronomy. 16. 18, 19. Exodus 23. 8. 2. Chro. 19. 6. Esa. 5. 23. Accepter of
persons. Pro. 24. 23, 24.^ 28. 2^ Leuit. 19. 15. Deuteronomy. 1. 16, 17.



The duty of the Notary, to deal truly in Writing, Preserving, Reciting
Records.

The duties of parties going to Law, are Common to both, as 1. To go to Law
only upon a just and necessary cause, at least, in their persuasion. 2. To
deal truly in their suite.
Peculiar to either, in criminal causes, viz. to the Plaintiff, to accuse
only in charity, for y^ good either of the Party. Co^monweale.
Defendant, Not to deny a crime truly objected. Josh. 7. 19. Nor to accuse him
self unnecessarily. Math. 26. 62, 63.




The duties of Lawyers and Advocates. viz. to Entertain no cause which they
know to be evil. Maintain the cause, which with good conscience they
undertake, Truly. Faithfully.



The duty of the Witness, To give testimony, when he is required thereto
upon just occasion; yea unrequired, when he sees the innocent oppressed.
Prou. 24. 11. To testify the truth Only. Wholly.
Prou. 14. 25.


Opp. To deal falsely in any of those respects.

Opp. Their faults are* Common to both, To go to Law for stomach, and in
desire of contention. To deal untruly, by Forging, or suggesting false
instruments, or proofs. Suborning false witnesses.

Peculiar to the Plaintiff, in criminal causes, Calumniari, to accuse of a
crime Untrue. Deuteronomy. 19. 16. Hest. 3. 8. Vnce^taine, which he cannot prove.
Act. 25. 7.
Praeuaricari, In show to accuse, but not indeed. Tergiuersari, To go back
from a just accusation.
Both which are ^ffences against the Co^monweale, To be ready, upon every
occasion, to accuse, which is to play the Sycophant; as contrariwise, to refuse
to accuse, upon any (though just and weighty) cause, is a fault. Leu. 5. 1.
Defendant, to Deny the fault untruly. Job 31. 33. Appeal without just cause.
Not to submit himself to the sentence lawfully given. Romans 13. 2.




Opp. To Undertake such causes as they suppose to be evil. Prou. 21. 6. Use
False calumniations against the adverse pa^ty. Act. 24. 5. Unfaithful dealing
toward their Client, either by Animating him to g^e on in a bad cause.
Betraying a good cause.




Opp. Not to give testimony to the truth. To bear false witness: the maine
sin forbidden in this Commandment. Pro. 6. 18. ^ 25. 18.^ 19. 5, 9 ^ 21. 28.
Deuteronomy. 19. 16, 19. and he is a false witness, who testifies for truth, that
which He knows not to be^ true. He knows to be false.



Public testimonies out of Judgment.

And they are either Open. Secret.


Open, as in Public Speeches, as in the ministry of the Word, wherein nothing
but truth is to be uttered. Writings.
Elections, wherein testimony is given of the excellency of him, that is
chosen, above others.


The Public testimonies which be secret, are commonly faulty, either because
they be untrue, or at least, uncharitable: as in making, or spreading Famous
and diffamatory Libels. Public rumors. Exodus 23. 1.


Private testimonies, or private profession of the truth concerning our
neighbor, joined with charity: and it is either of his Virtues, which (as just
occasion is offered) we are to acknowledge and commend, both in his presence,
and absence. Vices, which in his Presence, we are to tell him of, and not
suffer sin to rest upon him. Leu. 19. 17. Pro. 27. 5. Psalm. 141. 5. Absence,
we are not to mention, but upon necessity.



The duties which every man is bound by this Commandment to perform to
himself, are two; a Care of his good Name. True testimony of himself.


Opp. Errors and untruths broched and published in Public speeches,
especially in the ministry of the Word. Zac. 13. 3. Writings and books
printed.
False testimony in elections, when the more unworthy are preferred.


Opp. Flattery, wherein men offend in respect of the Object, praising men's
vices. Prou. 28. 4. ^ 24. 24. Manner, commending others Fainedly. Prou. 27. 4.
Above measure. Act. 12. 22.
End, seeking Their own profit, as Parasites use to do. The parties ruin,
whom they do flatter. Prou. 29. 5. Ier. 9. 8. Math. 22. 16.

Evil and cursed speaking.


Evil and cursed speaking is here forbidden, as it tends to the impairing
of our neighbors credit and good name.

And it is used, either in his Presence, by Reuiling, or contumelious speaking.
1. Cor. 6. 10. Deriding and scorning. 1. Sa. 31. 4. Ioh. 19. 3. Mat. 27. 42.

Hypocrisy. Seeking commendation by vanities and vices. Loving of flatterers.
Usual censuring of others. Math. 7. 1, 2. Attempting matters above their
ability and gifts. Psalm. 131. 1. Luke 14. 29* 30.
All which, end in infamy and shame. Infamy, arising from our selves, as sins,
Eccl. 10 1. both Open, and not only the sins themselves, but also all
appearances thereof. 1. These. 5. 22. Romans 12. 17. Secret. 2. Sam. 12. 12.
because God will bring them to light.
Others as oppr^brious speeches and slanders, against which we ought
(especially if we be publ^ke persons) de^end and maintain our good name 1.
King. 2. 8, 9.




The true testimony of our selves, is co^^^^ning Good, if it be True, vp^n just
occasion to confess it, vere and v^recunde, truly and modestly, to Gods glory.
1. Cor. 15. 10. False, with modesty and humility to deny it.
Evil, if it be True, we are to confess it to God. Prou. 28. 13. 1. Ioh. 1.
9. Man, when the confession is necessary, in respect of Gods glory. Josh. 7.
19. Iona. 1. 10. Neighbors good. Psalm. 51. Our own good. Iam. 5. 15.

False, constantly to deny it.



Opp. To Neglect these means of a good Name. Using the means of Vainglory.
Infamy.



Opp. (...), in denying good things, and speaking more basely and meanly of thy
self, than thine own opinion is of thy self, and that either to Avoid
boasting, which is the modest lie: which is not to affirm less than is true,
but to deny the truth. Draw commendation from others, which is a double
offense, being both Arrogance. Counterfeit modesty.

Boasting, wherein me^ offend, in respect of the Object, boasting of that Which
is not good, but rather evil. Psalm. 52. 1. Phil. 3. 19. Genesis 4. 23, 24. Good,
which they have not, either Not at all. Not in that measure which they assume
to themselves. Math. 26. 33, 35.

End, for their own Glory, Pro. 27. 2. and that joined either with the
Dishonor of God. 1. Cor. 4. 7. Esa. 10. 15. Disgrace of others. Luke 18. 10.
Gain. Act. 8. 9.




Opp. To Deny that evil which is true. Genesis 18. 15. Affirm that evil of our
selves, which is false, to Gratify others. Pick thanks. 2. Sam. 1. 10. with
1. Sam. 31. 4, 5.



The tenth Commandment.
The Negative part,
Forbidding in General, all evil concupiscence going before the consent of
the will, and purpose of the heart. Romans 7. 7. ^ 13. 9. Col. 3. 5. 1. Pet. 4. 2.
2. Pet. 3. 3. Romans 1. 24. Gal. 5. 16, 17. 1. Pet. 2. 11. Tit. 2. 12. Ioh. 8.
44. Particular, the concupiscence of the eyes.


Evil concupiscence is either Original. Actual.


Original concupiscence is original sin, which is here forbidden, as it is
referred against the neighbor: it is also called habitual, being the evil
inclination and pronenesse of our nature to lust against our neighbor,
contrary to the Law of God. Romans 8. 6, 7. ^ 7. 8, 23. Gal. ^. 17.

Actual concupiscences, are ill motions in our minds and hearts against our
neighbor, Genesis 6. 5. being both Foolish. Hurtful.
1. Tim. 6. 9. 1. Pet. 2. 11.

These evil motions are either, evil Fantasies and thoughts of the mind.
Affections and perturbations of the heart.


Those are evil fantasies and thoughts, which incline or stir men up to
evil, and are repugnant to charity, 1. Cor. 13. ^. These are sins, and here
forbidden. Pro. 24. 9. Zach. 8. 17. Deuteronomy. 15. 9. Esa. 55. 7. Act. 8. 22. Prou.
15. 26. Genesis 6. 5. ^ 8. 21.

The Affirmative part,
Requiring in us a pure heart toward our neighbor. 1. Tim. 1. 5.

The pureness of our heart consists in Original righteousness, and fect
love of our neighbor. Spiritual concupiscence.


Original righteousness, is both a Cleanness from all unrighteousness, and
evil concupiscence against our neighbor. Disposition and pronenesse to all
the duties of charity.


This righteousness, as the Lord planted it in our nature, so does he require
it in his Law; though we have lost it, and cannot fully attain to it; and
that to this end, that we seeing our unrighteousness, and misery in our
selves, might be forced to seek unto Christ, that both we might be clothed
with his righteousness, and also might by his Spirit be renewed according to
his image, in holiness and righteousness. Luke 1. 74, 75. Ephesians. 4. 23, 24.

Spiritual concupiscence contains the Good motions of the Spirit. Lusting of
the Spirit against the flesh.


Evil thoughts, either Are cast into men's minds by the devil, which be called
his suggestions. Arise from the habitual concupiscence.
And both of them whiles we be either Sleeping. Awaking.


The devil casts his suggestions into men's minds, either Immediately by
himself. 1. Chron. 21. 1. Ioh. 13. 2. Luke 9. 46, 47. Mediately, using others
for his instruments. Genesis 3. 1. Job 2. 9. Mat. 16. 23.


The suggestions of Satan, though always sinful in him, yet they are not
sins unto us, unless we admit them, and give entertainment to them: For it
is not a sin to be tempted, (for Christ also was tempted) but to yield to the
tentation. If therefore we admit them, we are defiled by them but if we
presently repel and extinguish them, they infect us not.

Evil thoughts arise also from our own habitual and original concupiscence.
Luke 24. 38. Mat. 15. 19. Genesis 6. 5.

They arise from the habitual concupiscence, it being moved or stirred up by
some object, either Apprehended by the sense. Framed by the fantasy or
imagination. Represented to the mind, by the remembrance.


Evil thoughts happen unto us, Awaking. Sleeping, as in dreams.


The good motions, are righteous and charitable Cogitations concerning our
neighbor. Affections toward him.


The lusting and combat of the Spirit, against the flesh. Gal. 5. 17. whereby
we must crucify the flesh, with the lusts thereof. Gal. 5. 24.

The means to attain to this pureness of the heart, are, to 1. Walk with
God, seeking to approve our hearts to him, who tries the hearts. 2. Observe
our Hearts, Prou. 4. 23. that No evil concupiscence do arise in us, or enter
into us. If any do arise, or be admitted, that we forthwith extinguish it.
Senses.



That evil concupiscences do not arise in us, or ente^ into us, a twofold
care is needful, Whiles we wake, to keep our minds occupied about lawful
things, and not suffer them to be idle, or to wander about vanities, or
unlawful things. When we are to sleep, to commend our souls into the hands
of God, to be kept safe from tentations, and pure from concupiscences.


We are also to observe our senses, (but especially our sight) by the ministry
whereof, the objects of concupiscence are represented to the mind. Genesis 3. 6.
Josh. 7. 21. Job 31. 1. Psalm. 119. 37.

To these means we are to add two more The spiritual armor of God, which is
mighty to cast down imaginations, and to subdue evil thoughts. 2. Cor. 10. 5.
Ephesians. 6. Fervent and faithful prayer. Mat. 6. 13.


Those that arise from our own corruption, if they be sudden and momentany,
they are the least degree of sin, but yet sins, arising from a corrupt
fountain, and arguing want of charity.

As touching dreams, those are culpable, which as they are the fruits of
original concupiscence, so also have voluntary causes: as, Wanton and unclean
dreams, following upon Intemperancy in diet. Wanton and unclean thoughts.
Malicious dreams, proceeding from hatred of our neighbor, and such like.


Now follow the affections and perturbations of the mind, going before the
purpose of the heart, or consent to practice.

T^^ degrees of them.

And these are either (...), fore-passions, or (as some speak) unformed
concupiscences, and acts of sensuality, going before the act of reason, or
consent of the will. These be the first motions of concupiscence, whereby the
Mind is withdrawn. Heart is affected with a sudden delight, as it were a bait.
Iam. 1. 14, 15.
(...), 1. These. 4. 5. Passions, which are of some called, Formed
concupiscences, and are acts of reason, as being deliberate desires of the
heart, and having the consent of the will* either to Take further delight only
in entertaining the foresaid ill motions, and rouling them in our minds,
though we consent not to the practice of them. These, with all the former, are
directly and expressly forbidden in this tenth Commandment. Put them in
practice, which are forbidden in the former Commandments; as the murder,
adultery, theft, false testimonies of the heart.



The sorts.

The affections of the heart, are either (...), wherein is auersation from that
which seems evil, as anger, fear, etc. (...), wherein is a liking or
desiring of that which seems good, as love, etc.


Unto (...), we are in this place to refer as branches of this Commandment,
sudden anger, and the first motions of mislike, hatred, envy, rejoicing at
other men's evils, etc.

(...), which more properly is called concupiscence, is distinguished by the
objects, 1. Ioh. 2. 15. for it is either of Pleasure, which is the lust of the
flesh. Profit, which is the lust of the eyes. Honor, which is the pride of
life.


The particular concupiscence which by name is forbidden in this Commandment,
is the concupiscence of the eyes, under which, as being the most pernicious, 1.
Tim. 6. 9, 10. the Lord forbids all sins of the same kind, that is, all
evil motions and concupiscences going before the consent of the will, or
purpose of the heart.

Affirm. Remedies against the concupiscence of the eyes.

1. To mortify selfeloue. 1. Cor. 10. 24. 2. To pull out the eyes of envy. 3.
To arm our selves with contentednes. Phil. 4. 11.
This concupiscence is distinguished according to the variety of the objects,
which being the persons or goods belonging to other men, we are not to covet, as
our neighbors House. Esa. 5. 8. Field. Deuteronomy. 5. 21. 1. King. 21. Wife.
Man-seruant. Maid-seruant. Cattle, as Ox, or Ass. 1. Sam. 12. 3. Money,
apparel, stuff. Act. 20. 33. Or any thing that is his.


In all the Commandments, add to the Affirmative part, and to all the duties
therein required, the duty of Using the means. Showing forth the signs.
Procuring y^ same in others.
Negative part, and to all the vices therein forbidden, the fault of Neglecting
the goodmean^. Using the bad means and allurements to evil. Showing forth the
signs of evil. Being accessory to the faults of others.



Deo Gratias.
