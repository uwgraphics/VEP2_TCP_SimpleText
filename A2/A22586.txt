royal blazon or coat of arms By the King. A Proclamation for the well ordering
and settling the Manufacture of Soape, under a Rule and Government.
WHereas We have heretofore declared by sundry Proclamations, Our Princely
care for the advancement of the native Commodities of Our Kingdoms, the
employment of many of Our poor people, and for the reformation of diverse
former Abuses, in making and uttering of Soape, to which end We have reduced
the manufacture thereof under the rule and government of the Society of
Soape-makers of Westminster formerly established by our letters Patents: And
have notwithstanding found by daily experience that many factious and
refractorie persons, forgetting the natural duty and obedience which they owe
to our Royal Commandments, have not only frequently disobeyed the same, but
have also studied and practiced diverse new ways to hinder the due and orderly
managing of so necessary a Work, and thereby to frustrate Our good and
gracious intentions toward Our loving Subjects, for remedy whereof, and for
the better preventing, and suppressing the practices of such malicious persons
in their lewd attempts: We have resolved, with the advice of Our Privy
Council, to settle and establish the manufacture of Soape under a rule and
government.

We do therefore hereby straightly charge and command, that no person or
persons, of what quality or condition soever, other then such who are, or
shall be free of the Company of Governor, Assistants, and Fellows of the
Society of Soape makers of Westminster, or such who shall make Soape, by, and
under the rule and government of the said Company, do at any time hereafter
presume to make or suffer to be made, any kind of Soape, or do make, prepare,
or draw, or suffer to be made, prepared, or drawn, any Lees for the making of
any kind of Soape whatsoever, in their private houses, or do make, prepare,
or draw, or cause to be made, prepared, or drawn, any Soape, or Lees, in any
other place, or places whatsoever, either for their own use, or otherwise,
upon pain of forfeiture of all such Soape and Lees, respectively, and such
further punishments as may be inflicted upon the contemners, and breakers of
Our Royal Command and Authority.

And We do hereby Authorize, Require and Command the said Governor,
Assistants, and Fellows of the said Society of Soape-makers of Westminster,
their Agents, Officers, and Servants, that from time to time they cause
diligent search and inquiry to be made in any place or places whatsoever; as
well within Liberties as without, for all, or any Soape, of what kind soever,
that is, has, or shall be made, sold or vented, as also for all or any Lees
made, prepared or drawn, or which shall be made, prepared or drawn by any
person or persons whatsoever, and not by and under the rule and government of
the said Society, and all such Soape and Lees respectively to take, seize and
carry away, And afterward to destroy the same, or otherwise to reboyle or
amend, to make them useful and serviceable.

And because the said Governor Assistants and Fellowship of Soape-makers are
forced to be at excessive Charges by employment of several men in searching,
seizing and other discovery of Soape made or put to Sale contrary to the Tenor
of this and other Our former Proclamations; We are therefore well pleased that
the said Company shall reward their Informers, Agents and Seizers of such Soape
and Lees with or out of the same or part thereof, or the benefit that shall be
made thereof.

And We do hereby also straightly charge and command that no person or
persons whatsoever, either Our own natural borne Subjects, Denizens, or
Strangers, Merchants, Artificers or any other, do hereafter importe or bring
in, or attempt to importe or bring into this Our Kingdom of England or
Dominion of Wales from Our Kingdoms of Scotland or Ireland, or from any
foreign parts any manner or kind of Soape hard or soft whatsoever, upon pain
of forfeiture of all such Soape to be so imported, and such further penalties
and punishments as in cases of like nature are usually inflicted upon the
contemners of Our Royal command and authority.

And for the better performance and execution hereof; We do further charge
and command all and singular the Officers of Our Customs within all and every
the Ports and Havens of Our said Kingdom and Dominions, and the Creeks and
members thereof, as also within Our Cinque Ports and the members thereof, that
they and every of them do not only forbear to take any Entry or Entryes or
give any Bill or Warrant for vnlading or landing of any Soape prohibited as
aforesaid; but do also cause Seizure and stay to be made thereof to Our use
upon pain of forfeiture of his or their Offices respectively, and undergoing
Our heavy displeasure and such other punishments as their neglects and
contempts herein shall be found to deserve.

And we do hereby further straightly charge and command all Grocers, Salters,
Chandlers, Retaylers of Soape and all others that deal in Soape, that they
presume not to receive, keep, buy, utter, use or spend any Soape of what kind
soever but that which is or shall be made by the said Governor, Assistants
and Fellows of the said Corporation, or by and under their rule and
government, and that no person or persons other then by and under the rule and
government aforesaid, do presume to make, prepare, draw or sell any Lees for
the use of making any Soape, upon pain of forfeiture of the said Soape and Lees
respectively, and also upon pain of incurring Our heavy displeasure, and such
punishment as their contempt in that behalf shall demerit.

And whereas the Governor, Assistants, and Fellows of the Society aforesaid,
by their Searchers and Subordinate Officers do usually meet with and find
persons of mean and needy condition, who are employed by other men of better
ability and estates, thereby disguising themselves in making of Soape, and
drawing of Lees, not under the Rule and Government of the said Corporation;

We do therefore hereby further declare that the Owners, Lessees, and
Inhabitants of all and every such house and houses, where any such Soape shall
be made, or Lees made, prepared, or drawn by any person or persons whatsoever,
not by, and under the Rule and Government of the said Corporation, as well as
the owners of such Soape and Lees, shall be proceeded against in Our Court of
Star Chamber, as contemners of Our Royal pleasure and Command.

And for the better discovery of all and every the said Offenders, We do
hereby Authorize, Will, and Command the said Governor, Assistants, and
Fellows of the said Society, their Officers, Ministers, and Servants, to enter
into any Houses, Cellars, Shoppes, Warehouses, or other places whatsoever, and
there to search, seize, take and carry away any Soape unmarked by the said
Company, or not made under the Rule and Government of the said Company, or any
Lees for the making of Soape, not made and drawn under the said Rule and
Government.

And whereas We have by some of Our said former Proclamations commanded that
all the Fats, Pannes, and Vessels set up, or that should be set up, or employed
for the making, or boiling of Soape, contrary to the said Letters Patents, and
Proclamations should be pulled up by the Owners of them, before the Feast of
the Virgin Mary then next coming, and sithence past;

Now for the better preventing avoiding and hindering the making of any manner
of Soape and the making, preparing, or drawing of any Lees contrary to the
Tenor and Intention of this Our Proclamation; Our Will and Pleasure is, and We
do hereby straightly charge and command the said Governor, Assistants, and
Fellows of the said Society of Soape-makers of Westminster, their Agents,
Officers and Servants, to break, deface, or destroy all Pannes, Pots,
Lee-Tubs, Fats, Cisternes, and other Vessels, employed and set up, or that
shall be employed or set up, for making of Soape, or for making, preparing, or
drawing of Lees to make Soape in any house or houses, or other place or places
whatsoever, as well within Liberties as without, by any person or persons
what-soeuer, not free of the said Society of Soape-makers of Westminster, or
such persons who shall make Soape, or draw Lees, by and under the Rule and
Government of the said Company.

And We do hereby straightly charge and command all Majors, Sheriffs,
Justices of the Peace, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughes, and all other Our
Officers, Ministers and loving Subjects whatsoever that from time to time
without excuse or delay they readily and diligently attend and give their aid
and assistance in the due and full execution of all and every the premises,
when they shall be thereunto required.

And We do withal hereby require Our Attorney general, that from time to
time he carefully proceed in our court of Star Chamber against all or any
such person and persons that shall presume to offend or not yield obedience to
Our Command in the premises.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, the five and twentieth day of January in the
tenth year of Our Reign.
God save the King.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1634.
