No formal Hypocrite shall then
amongst the Saints have place.

to Happiness they tend:
But Sinners, and the Paths they tread
shall both in Ruin end.
PSALM II.

why do the Heathen storm?
Why in such rash Attempts engage,

their various Forces bring;
Against the Lord they all unite,
and his anointed King.

Presumptuously they say?
No, let us break their slavish Bands,
and cast their Chains away.

Does their conspiring Strength defy,
and mocks their vain Design.

And thus will he in Thunder speak

"Thou art my Son, this day my Heir
"have I begotten thee.

"thine shall the Heathen be;
"The utmost Limits of the Lands
"shall be possessed by thee.

"As massy Bars of Iron break
"the Potters brittle Ware.

And as their Numbers hourly rise,

The God in whom he trusts, say they,

For I through him securely sleep,

And scattered often these Foes to me,

No Prisoner of the silent Grave

The Night, that quiets common Griefs,

my Eyes with weakness close;
Old Age o'ertakes me, whilst I think
on my insulting Foes.

For God, I find, accepts my Tears,

Shall blush and rage, to see that God

Which thou have righteously ordained

O let them fall by those Designs

And sordid Wretches; whom God hates,

And therefore in their stubborn Mind

Because thy Judgments unobserved
are far above their sight.

They think their vain Designs shall thrive,

By which the Mischief of their Heart
they study to disguise.

The Innocent and Poor at once
to rifle, and destroy.

And, by the Greatness of thy Power,

PSALM XI.

Why should I, like a timorous Bird,

It Is time for Innocence to fly
from such deceitful Arts.

For scarce these wretched Times afford

When those whom they despised and vexed

How long my Enemies insult,

And suddenly, or I shall sleep
in everlasting Night.

Permit not them that vex my Soul
to triumph in my Shame.

Thy saving Health will come, and then
my Heart with Joy shall spring:

Who to thy Servant in Distress
such Bounty did extend.
PSALM XIV.

Corrupt and lewd their Practice grows,
no Breast is warmed with holy Flame.

To see if any owned his Power;
if any Truth or Justice knew.

None took Religion for their Guide,

That they, like Bread, my People eat,

For, to the Righteous, God is near,

Since God a Refuge is for those

Then Shouts of universal Joy

Nor hearken to a false Report,

And Piety, though clothed in Rags,

And though he promise to his Loss,

The Man, who by this steady Course

When Earth's foundation shakes, shall stand,

PSALM XVI.

and shield me, Lord, from Harm;
Because my Trust I still repose
on thy Almighty Arm.

Yet can no Deeds of mine require
the Goodness thou have shown.

and love the thing that is right,
To favor always and prefer

Their bloody Offerings I detest,
their very Names abhor.

He fills my Cup with liberal hand;

The place of my appointed Reign

And private Counsel still afford,
in Sorrow's dismal Night.

No danger shall my Hopes remove,

Nor let thy Holy One in death
the least Corruption see.

Where Pleasures dwell without allay,
and Joys that never fade.

And to my Prayer, as it is unfeigned,

And with impartial Eyes, O Lord,

And on the strictest Trial found

O! now, my God, incline thine Ear
to this my just Request.

PART II.

To guard me safe from salvage Foes,

in their own Fat they lie;
And with a proud blaspheming Mouth
both God and Man defy.

With Eyes at watch, and Bodies bowed,
and couching on the Ground,

when greedy of his Prey;
Or a young Lion, when he lurks
within a covert way.

From wicked Men, who are thy Sword,
deliver thou my Soul;

whose Portion's here below;
Who, filled with earthly Stores, desire
no other Bliss to know;

their Substance while they live:
Their Heirs survive, to whom they may
the vast Remainder give.

And waking, shall its Image find
reflected in my Soul.
PSALM XVIII.

my firm Affection, Lord, to thee;
For thou have always been my Rock,
a Fortress, and Defense to me,
Thou mv Deliv'rer art, my God;
my Trust is in thy mighty Power;
Thou art my Shield from Foes abroad,
at home my Safeguard and my Tower.

(to whom all Praise we justly owe;)
So shall I, by thy watchful Care,
be guarded from my treacherous Foe,

with Seas of Sorrow compassed round,
With dire infernal Pangs oppressed,
in Death's unweildy Fetters bound.

to God addressed my humble Moan;
Who graciously inclined his Ear,
and heard me from his lofty Throne.
PART II.

the conscious Earth was struck with fear;
The Hills did at his Presence shake,
nor could his dreadful Fury bear.

ensigns of Wrath before him came;
Devouring Fire around him glowed,
that Coals were kindled at his Flame.

whilst Heaven bowed down its awful head;
Beneath his Feet substantial Night
was, like a sable Carpet spread.

which active Troops of Angels drew,
On a strong Tempest s rapid Wings,
with most amazing swiftness flew.

with thickest Shades his Face to veil;
But at his Brightness soon retired,
and fell in showers of Fire and Hail.

God's angry Voice did loudly roar;
While Earth's sad Face, with heaps of Hail
and flakes of Fire, was covered over.

which made his scattered Foes retreat;
Like Darts, his nimble Lightenings flew,
and quickly finished their Defeat.

the World's Foundations naked lay;
By his avenging Wrath exposed,
which fiercely raged that dreadful Day.
PART III.

And snatched me from the furious Rage
of threatening Waves that proudly swelled.

my strongest Foes attempts to break;
Who else with ease had soon destroyed
the weak Defense that I could make.

when I distressed and friendless lay;
But still when other Succors failed,
God was my firm Support and Stay.

he brought me forth, and set me free;
For some just Cause his Goodness found,
that moved him to delight in me.

God does his gracious Help extend;
My Hands are free from bloody Stains,
therefore the Lord is still my Friend.

in his just Paths I always trod;
I never did his Statutes slight,
nor loosly wandered from my God.

His Favors therefore yet endure
because my Heart and Hands are clean.
PART IV.

They who for Mercy merit Praise,
with thee shall wondrous Mercy find.
Thou to the Just shall Justice show,
the Pure thy Purity shall see;
Such as perversely choose to go,

and crush the Haughty's boasted Might,
In me the Lord an Instance gave,
whose Darkness he has turned to Light.

Nor feared, whilst he was on my side,

He Is a strong Shield to all that need,
and on his sure Protection rest.

Or who, except the mighty Lord,

Through him my Feet can swiftly run,
and nimbly climb the steepst Hills.

and manly Weapons learn to wield;
Strong Bows of Steel with ease I break,
forced by my stronger Arms to yield.

His Hand sustains me still, my Wealth
and Greatness from his Bounty flows.

And, when in slippery ways I trod,

He makes my strong Opposers yield,

Aided by him, I root out those
who hate and envy my Success.

but none was able to defend;
At length to God for Help they cried,
but God would no assistance lend.

their broken Troops I scattered round:
Their slaughtered Bodies forth I threw,
like loathsome Dirt that clogs the Ground.
PART VI

The Heathen to my Scepter bow,
and foreign Nations own my sway.

Strangers for my Commands attend,

For stronger Holds they quit the Field,
and still in strongest Holds afraid.

Over highest Heavens his Name be raised,

It Is he, that with resistless Might

He made me great, and set me free,
from my remorseless bloody Foe.

my grateful Voice to Heaven I Will raise;
And Nations, Strangers to his Name,
shall thus be taught to sing his Praise;

"His Mercy evermore extends
"to David and his promised Race.

PSALM XXXVII.

Yet let not their successful State,
thy Anger or thy Envy raise;

Or like young Flowers, away shall pass,
whose blooming Beauty soon decays,

So thou within the Land shall stay,
secure from Danger, and from Want:

And He, thy Duty to requite,
shall all thy earnest Wishes grant.

And he will needful Help afford
to perfect every just Design;

Thy clouded Innocence appear,
and as a midday Sun to shine,

And patiently for him attend;
nor let thy Anger sondly rise:
Though wicked Men with Wealth abound,
And with Success the Plots are crowned,
which they maliciously devise.

Let no ungoverned Passion make
thy wavering Heart espouse their Crime;

Whilst only they the Land enjoy
who trust on him, and wait his time.

Their Place shall vanish quite away,
nor by the strictest search be found:

Rejoicing still with godly Mirth,
with Peace and Plenty always crowned.
PART II.

Against the righteous few combine,
and gnash their teeth, and threatening stand;

And laugh at their defeated Pride:
he sees their Ruin near at hand.

The Poor and Needy to o'erthrow,
and Men of Upright Lives to slay:

Their sharpened Weapon's mortal Stroke
through their own Hearts shall force its way.

And by one Righteous Man possessed,
the Wealth of many Bad excels:

But as for those that break his Laws,
their unsuccessful Power he quells.

And over all their Life presides,
their Portion shall for ever last:

And with Success the Plots are crowned,
which they maliciously devise.

Let no ungoverned Passion make
thy wavering Heart espouse their Crime;

Whilst only they the Land enjoy
who trust on him, and wait his time.

Their Place shall vanish quite away,
nor by the strictest search be found:

Rejoicing still with godly Mirth,
with Peace and Plenty always crowned.
PART II.

Against the righteous few combine,

And laugh at their defeated Pride:

And by one Righteous Man possessed,
the Wealth of many Bad excels:

But as for those that break his Laws,
their unsuccessful Power he quells.

And over all their Life presides,
their Portion shall for ever last:

Shall be unmoved, and even in Dearth
The happy Fruits of Plenty taste.

Who proudly dare God's Will oppose;
destruction is their hapless share:
Like Fat of Lambs, their Hopes and they
Shall in an instant melt away,
and vanish into Smoke and Air.
PART III.

Still borrow on, and never pay,
The Just have Will and Power to give:

Shall peaceably the Earth possess;
And those he curses shall not live.

He orders all the Steps aright
of him that moves by his Command;

Yet shall he never be quite oppressed,
for God upholds him with his Hand.

I never saw the Righteous failed,
or Want overtake his numerous Race;

And he did cheerfully impart;
God made his Offspring's Wealth increase.

In Virtue's ways with Zeal proceed,
and so prolong your happy Days:

Preserve his Saints secure from Ill,
while soon the wicked Race decays.

His Portion shall for Ages stand;
his Mouth with Wisdom is supplied,
His Tongue by Rules of Judgment moves,
His Heart the Law of God approves,
therefore his Footsteps never slide.
PART IV.

In vain the Righteous to surprise;
in vain his Ruin does decree;

To his Revenge exposed, but save,
and when he is sentenced, set him free.

And thou Exalted in the Land,
thy blessed Possession never shall quit.
The Wicked soon destroyed shall be,
And, at his dismal Tragedy
thou shall a safe Speator sit.

And like a Bay Tree fresh and green
that spreads its pleasant Branches round:

And though in every place I sought,
no sign or track of him I found.

And mark all such as Upright are;
their roughest days in Peace mail end;

Who dare God's sacred Will oppose,
a common Ruin shall attend.

Their only Safeguard is the Lord,
their Strength in times of Need is He,

The Lord will timely Succor send,
and from the Wicked set them free.
PSALM XXXVIII.

Nor let at once on me the storm

PSALM XXXIX.

I kept my Tongue in aw;
I curbed my hasty words when I
the Wicked prosperous saw.

and did my Tongue refrain
From good Discourse; but that restraint
incres'd my inward Pain.

and Repose could take;
Till strong Reflecion fanned the Fire,
and thus at length I spoke.

The numerous Train of Ills disclose,

And every Man in best Estate

Before I vanish quite from hence,

PSALM XL:

On solid Ground he placed my Feet,

Why leave thou me in deep Distress?
Why go I mourning all the Day,

PSALM XLIV
O Lord, our Fathers often have told
in our attentive Ears,
Thy Wonders in their days'perform'd,
and elder Times than theirs:

the Heathen from this Land;
Dispeopled by repeated Strokes
of thy avenging Hand.

Nor strength, that from unequal Force
their fainting Troops could save;
But thy Right Hand, and powerful Arm,
whose Succor they implored,
Thy Presence with the chosen Race,

O therefore, as thou did to them,
to us Deliverance bring.

And crush 'em with repeated Strokes

A present Help when Dangers press;
In him undaunted we'll conside:

And Mountains in the Ocean lost,

Shall mock the Affaults of Earthly Powers,

And Kingdoms War against us waged,

Our Tower of Refuge in Alarms,

On Earth what Desolation brought,

He broke the warlike Spear and Bow;
With them their thund ring Chariots too
into devouring Flames were hurled.

For him the Heathen shall obey,
and Earth her Sovereign Lord confess.

As to our Fathers in Difsress.

And he from Sion has appeared,
Where Beauty in Perfection shines.

Nor He-goat from thy Fold accept:

The Cattle too are all my own,

In craggy Rocks; and salvage Beasts,
That loosely haunt the open Fields.

Since the World's mine, and all it yields.

On slaughtered Bulls and Goats to feed,
To eat their Flesh, and drink their Blood?

And Vows with strictest Care made good.

And I will set thee safe and free;
And thou returns of Praise shall make:

How dare thou teach my Laws abroad,
Or in thy Mouth my Covenant take?

Have proof against Instrucion been,
And of my Word did lightly speak:

Thou gladly did with him agree,
And with Adult'rers did partake.

Deceitful Tales does hourly spread:

Thy Brother, and with Lies confound
The Offspring of thy Mother's Bed.

Till thou did wickedly surmise,
That I was such a one as thou;
But I Will reprove and shame thee now,
And set thy Sins before thine Eyes.

Whilst none shall dare your cause to own.

And to the Man that justly lives,
My strong Salvation shall be shown.

For they, tho with their Mouths they bless,
In private curse with inward Spite.

My Rock and Health will strength supply.

And when I wake in dead of Night:

Beneath the Shadow of thy Wing,

In her Support is daily shown:

And washest out the Crimson Die.

And those whom stormy Waves surround.

Makes Lands, that barren were before,
With Corn and useful Fruits abound.

And every furrowed Valley fills;
Thou make them soft with gentle Showers,
In which a blessed Increase distills.

With fresh Returns of Plenty crown;
And where thy glorious Paths appear,
Thy fruitful Clouds drop Fatness down.

By them to Pastures fresh and green;
The Hills about in order ranged
In beauteous Robes of Joy are seen.

A plentuous Crop of full-ear'd Corn.
And seem for Joy to shout and sing.

But yet at last thou brought us forth

The choicest Goats from out the Fold,
and Bullocks from the Stall.

Whilst I what God for me has done,
with graceful Joy declare.

Who if my Heart had harbored Sin,

And to the Voice of my Request
with constant Love attend.

who never, when I pray,
Withholds his Mercy from my Soul,
nor turns his Face away.
PSALM LXVII.
TO bless thy chosen Race,
in Mercy, Lord, incline;
And cause the brightness of thy Face
on all thy Saints to shine.

Whilst distant Lands their Tribute pay,
and thy Salvation own.

For Thou, the Righteous Judge and King,

Let all the World, O Lord, combine

And we with Plenty shall be crowned.

shall constant Blessings shower,
And all the World in awe shall stand
Of his resistless Power
PSALM LXVIII.
LET God, the God of Battle rife,
And scatter his presumptuous Foes;
Let shameful Rout their Host surprise,
Who spitefully his Power oppose.

Or Wax into the Furnace cast,
So let their facrilegious Host
Before his wrathful Presence waste.

His Favour's gentle Beams enjoy;
Their upright Hearts let Gladness fill,
And cheerful Songs their Tongues employ,

Jehovah's awful Name he bears;
In him rejoice, extol his Praise,
Who rides upon high rolling Spheres.

To this low World Compassion draws,
The Orphan's Claim to patronize,
And judge the injured Widow's Cause.

Restores poor Exiles to their Home;
Makes Captives free, and fruitless Toil
Their Proud Oppressors righteous Doom.

In Person Lord, our Armies forth,
Strange Terrors through the Desert spread,

The breaking Clouds did Rain distill,
And Heavens high Arches shook with Fear.
How then should Sinai's humble Hill
Of Israel's God the Prefence bear?

Relieved her from Celestial Stores;
And when thy Heritage was faint
Asswag'd the Drought with plenteous showers.

At Ease thou made our Tribes reside;
And in the Desert for the Poor,
Thy generous Bounty did provide.
PART II.

And in that powerful Word o'ercame,
While Virgin-Troops with Songs of Mirth
In state our Conquest did proclaim.

As yet had never received a Foil,
Forsook their Camp with sudden Dread,
And to our Women left the Spoil.
Egypt's Drudges you have been,
Your Army's Wings shall shine as bright
As Dove's in golden Sunshine seen,
Or silvered over with paler Light.

Over scattered Kings the Conquest won;
Our Troops, drawn up on Jordan's Strand,
High salman's glittering Snow out-shone.
Jordan's farther Coaft,
And Bashan's Hill we did advance:
No more her Height shall Bashan boast,
But that she is God's Inheritance.

Should this, O Mountains, swell your Pride?
For Sion is his chosen Seat,
Where he for ever will reside.

Are heavenly Hosts, that wait his Will;
His Prefence now fills Sion Towers.
As once it honored Sinai's Hill.

Captivity has Captive led,
And on thy People did bestow,
The Spoil of Armies, once their Dread.
Even Rebels shall partake thy Grace,
And humble Proselytes repair
To worship at thy Dewlling Place,
And all the World pay Homage there.

Be daily his great Name adored;

Of Life and Death the Sovereign Lord.

Proportioned Vengeance has decreed,
To wound the Hoary Head of those
Who in presumptuous Crimes proceed

"As I subdued proud Bashan's King,
"Once more I Will break my Pople's Yoke,
"And from the Deep my Servants bring.

"Of slaughtered Foes be covered over,
"Nor Earth receive such impious Blood,
"But leave for Dogs the unhallowed Gore.
PART III.

The wondering Multitude surveyed
The Pompous State of Thee, our God,
In Robes of Majesty arrayed,
Levites led the Van,
Loud Instruments brought up the Rear;
Between both Troops a Virgin-train
With Voice and Timbrel charmed the Ear.

"In full Assemblies bless the Lord,
"All, who to Israel's Tribes belong,
"The God of Israel's Praise record.
Benjamin alone
From neighboring Bounds did there attend
Nor only Judah's nearer Throne,
Her Counselors in state did send;
But Zebulon's remorer Seat,
And Nepthali's more distant Coast
(The grand Procession to complete)
Sent up their Tribes, a princely Host.

Our Tribes, at strife till that blessed hour:
This Work which thou, O God, have wrought,
Confirm with fresh Recruits of Power.
Salem, Lord, descend;
And Sion thy terrestrial Throne;
Where Kings with Presents shall attend,
And Thee with offered Crowns atone.

Like pampered Herds of Savage Might,
Their Silver-armour'd Chiefs defeat,
Who in destructive War delight.
shall then to God stretch forth
Her Hands, and Africa Homage bring:

Their common Sovereign's Praises sing.

Of ancient Heaven sublimely rides;
From whence his dreadful Voice we hear,
Like that of warring Winds and Tides.

Of humble Israel he takes Care;
Whose Strength from out the dusky Sky
Darts shining Terrors through the Air.

Where God has fixed his earthly Throne,
His Strength his feeble Saints supports:
To God give Praise, and him alone
PSALM LXIX.
SAve me, O God, from Waves that roll,
And press to overwhelm my Soul.

And Deluges overflow my Head.

My Voice is hoarse with long Complaint
My Sight decays with tedious Pain,
Whilst for my God I wait in vain.

Compare'd with Foes that me pursue
With groundless hate, grown now of might
To execute their lawless Spite.
They force me guiltless to resign,
As Rapine what by right was mine.

Nor are my Sins concealed from Thee.

Lest for my sake thy Saints despair;

Reproach, and hid my Face in shame.

Nor to my nearest Kindred known;
A Foreigner, exposed to Scorn
By Brethren of my Mother born.

Consumes me like devouring Flame,
Concerned at their Affronts to Thee,
More than at Slanders cast on me.

They construe in a spiteful Sense;

They me their eommon Proverb make.

Those Wrongs they ought to have redrest!
How should I then expect to be
From Libels of lewd Drunkards free?

For Help with humble timely Prayer;
Relieve me from thy Mercies store,
Display thy Truth's preserving Power.

And from the Mire my Feet retrieve;
From spiteful Foes in safety keep,
And snatch me from the raging Deep.

And roll its Waves above my Head;
Nor deep Destruction's open Pit,
To close her Jaws on me permit.

For thy transcending Goodness sake;
Relieve thy Supplicant once more
From thy abounding Mercy's store.

Make haste, for desperate is my Case:

And shield me from remorseless Foes.

I from my Enemies have born,
Nor can their close dissembled Spite,
Or darkest Plots escape thy Sight.

I looked for some to take my part,
To Pity or relieve my Pain;
But looked (alas!) for both in vain!

Instead of Food they give me Gall;
And when, with Thirst my Spirits sink,
They give me Vinegar to drink,

Shall prove a Snare, a Trap their Wealth:

And sudden Blasts their Hopes surprise.

Till thy fierce Wrath their Race devour;

Where none will ever vouchsase to dwell

For him who had thy Stripes endured
And made, the Wounds thy Scourge had torn
To bleed afresh with sharper Scorn.

Till they to Truth have lost the Way.

Nor with the Just their Names enroll.

Thy strong Salvation shall restore:

And celebrate with Thanks thy Name.

Than Herds or Flocks in Sacrifice:

And hope for like redress with me.

Sets Prisoners free from close Restraint:

And all the World resound his Praise.
Sions, Walls erect,
And Judah's Cities still protect;
Till all her scattered Sons repair
To undisturbed possession there.

To their Religious Heirs bequeath;
And they to enless Ages more,
Of such as his blessed Name adore.
PSALM LXX.
O Lord, to my Relief draw near,
For never was more, pressing Need
For my Deliverance, Lord, appear,
And add to that Deliverance Speed.

Who to destroy my Soul combine;
Let them, defeated, blush and mourn;
Ensnared in their own vile Design.

With shame their Malice be repaid,
Who mocked my Confidence in Thee,
And Sport of my Affliction made.

To joyful Triumphs shall be raised;
And all who prize thy saving-Grace
With me shall sing, The Lord be praised.

The mighty Lord of me takes care;
Thou God, who only can restore,
To my relief with speed repair.
LPSALM LXXI.
IN Thee I put my steadfast Trust;
defend me, Lord, from Shame;
Incline thine Ear, and save my Soul,
for righteous is thy Name.

It Is thy Decree that keeps me safe.

For from my earliest Youth till now

Thou took'st me from my Mother's Womb
to sing thy constant Praise.

Thy Honor therefore and thy Praise

Forsake me not, when, worn with years,
my Vigor fades away.

Against my Soul they lay their Snares,

And I in grateful Songs of Praise

Unable yet to count them all,

All other Righteousness disclaim,

And ever fince thy wondrous Works

Till I to these and future times,

The mighty Works which thou have done!

And from the lowest depth of Woe
with tender Care retrieve.

With Power and Greatness crowned,
And me, who dismal Years have past,
thy Comforts shall surround.

To Thee, the God of Jacob's Race;

My grateful Soul, by Thee redeemed,

Because thou did confound my Foes,
and brought them all to shame.
PSALM LXXII.

And let his Son throughout his Reign,

Whilst all the helpless Poor shall him

Which all the Land shall own to be

And from their humble Necks shall take

Or like warm Showers whose gentle Drops

From spicy Sheba Gifts shall come,

And differing Nations gladly join

And over their defenseless Lives

And in his fight their guitless Blood

Whilst Eastern Princes Tribute pay,

A Handful sown on Mountain Tops

Its Fruit, like Cedars shook by Winds,

The City too shall thrive, and vie.

His spotless Fame shall shine as bright

And his unbounded Happiness

Whilst to his Praise the listening World
their glad Assent proclaim.
PSALM LXXIII.
AT length, by certain Proofs it is plain
That God will to his Saints be kind,
That all, whose Hearts are pure and clean
Shall his protecting Favor find.

My stagg'ring Feet had almost failed;
I grieved the Sinners Wealth to view,
And envied when the Fools prevailed.

And whilst they live are hail and strong;
No Plague or Troubles them offend,
Which often to other Men belong.

And Rapine seems their Robe of State;
Their Eyes, stand out with Fatness swelled,
They grow, beyond their Wishes, great.

Oppressive Methods they desend;
Their Tongue through all the Earth does walk;
Their Blasphemies to Heaven ascend.

Who servile Visits duly make,
Because with Plenty they abound.
Of which their flattering Slaves partake.

Till they with them profanely cry,
"How should the Lord our Actions view,
"Can he perceive who dwells so high?

Who openly their Sins prosess.
And yet their Wealth's increased each day,
And all their Actions meet Success.

And washed my Hands from Guilt in vain,
If all the day oppressed I lie,
And every morning suffer Pain.

But if such things I rashly say,
Tuy Children, Lord, I must offend,
And basely should their Cause betray.
PART II.

But found the case too hard for me;
Till to the House of God I went,
Then I their End did plainly see,

On slippery Places loosely stand;
Thence into Ruin headlong fall,
Cast down by thy avenging Hand.

Despised by Thee when they are destroyed;
As waking Men with Scorn do treat
The Fancies that their Dreams employed.

My Reins were racked with restless Pains,
So stupid was I, like a Beast,
Who no reflecting Thought retains.

And thy Right Hand Assistance gave:
Thou first shall with thy Coursel guide,
And then to glory me receive.

Have I, whose Favor I require?
Throughout the spacious Earth there is none
That I besides thee can desire.

May often fail to succor me;
But God shall inward strength impart,
And my eternal Portion be.

Shall into sudden Rain fall;
If after other Gods they rove,
Thy Vengeance shall destroy them all.

That I should stiil to Godrepair;
In him I always put my Trust,
And will his wondrous Works declare.
PSALM LXXIV.
WHY have thou cast us off, O God,
with thou no more return?
O why against thy chosen Flock,
does thy fierce Anger burn?

the Land that is thy own.
By thee redeemed, and Sion's Mount
where once the Glory shone.

See! how the Foe with wicked Rage

The Heathen there with haughty Pomp
Their Banners have displayed.

With Ax and Hammer they destroy,

Has been profaned, and quite defaced,

And all the sacred Places burned
where we thy Praise proclaimed:

We have no Prophet now that knows

Shall all the Honor of thy Name

When Vengeance calls to stretch it forth,

For us, throughout the wondering World,

Thou brak'st the watery Monster's Head,

And how the foolish People have

For now each Corner of the Land

Whose Insolence, if unchastiz'd,

PSALM LXXV.
TO thee, O God, we render Praise,

For, that thy Name to us is nigh,
thy wondrous Works declare.
Israel when my Throne is fixed,

And warned bold Sinners that they should

From Southern Climes arrives.

The bitter Dregs, and be condemned

The justice then of Jacob's God
my Song shall celebrate.

their Cruelty disarm;
Exalt the Just, and seat him high,

PSALM LXXVI.
IN Judah the Almighty's known,
(Almighty there by Wonders shown)
His Name in Jacob does excel:
Salem stands,
The Majesty that Heaven commands
In Sion condescends to dwell.

The Shield, the tempered Sword and Spear,
There slain the mighty Army lay;
Sion's Fame through Earth is spread,
Of greater Glory, greater Dread,
Than Hills, where Robbers lodge their Prey.

Themselves met there a shameful Foil.
Securely down to sleep they lay.
But waked no more; their stoutest Band
Never lifted one resisting Hand
Against his that did their Legion's slay.
Jacob's God began to frown,
Both Horse and Charioteers, overthrown,
Together slept in endless Night:

Do once with wrathful Looks appear,
What mortal Power can stand thy fight?

Grew hushed with Fear, when thou did come


It Is last Attempts but serve to raise
The Triumphs of Almighty Power.

Thus to his Name due Reverence pay,

And to their helpless Prey make haste.

Down on our knees devoutly all

If then you will (like his Flock) draw near,
To day, if you his Voice will hear,

Nor here provoke my Wrath, as they
In Desert Plains of Meribab;

And me with fresh Temptations proved;
They still, through Unbelief, rebelled,
While they my wondrous Works beheld.

Though daily I their Wants relieved;
Then, -- It Is a faithless Race, I said,
Whose Heart from me has always strayed;
They never will tread my righteous path;
Therefore to them, in settled Wrath,
Since they despised my Rest, I swear
That they should never enter there.

Ascribe due Honor to his Name;

Before his Throne your Homage pay,
Which he, and he alone can claim.

Let all the trembling World resort.

Whose power the Uhiverse sustains,
And banished Justice will restore;

And heavenly Mirth Let Earth express;

The tuneful Quire of Birds awake,

Who How sets out with awful State,

From Heaven to judge the World he is come
With Justice to reward and doom.

The proudest hills like Wax did melt
In presence of the Almighty Lord.

And all the trembling World below,
Have his descending Glory viewed.

All who of Pageant-Idols boast,
To him, ye Gods, your worship-pay.

He when the guiltless Suff'rer cries,
His Foe with just Revenge pursues.

To Moses and our Fathers known:
His Works to his Eternal praise,
Were to the Sons of Jacob shown.

And unexampl'd Acts of Grace,
His wakened Wrath does slowly move,
His willing Mercy flows apace;

But with his Anger quickly part;
And loves his Punishments to guide
More by his Love than our Desert.

Above this little Spot of Clay;
So much his boundless Love transcends
The small Respects that we can pay.

So far has he our sins removed
Who with a Father's tender Breast
Has such as fear him always loved.

Considers that we are but Clay;
How fresh so'er we seem, our Days
Like Grass or Flowers' must fade away.

Nor can we find their former place;
God's faithful Mercy ever lasts,
To those that fear him, and their Race.

Proceed in his appointed way;
And who not only knows his Will,
But to it just Obedience pay.

In Heaven has fixed his lofty Throne:
To him, ye Angels, praises sing,
In whose great strength his Power is shown.
Ye that his just commands obey,
And hear and do his sacred Will;

Who still what he ordains fulfill.

The mighty Lord: and thou, my heart,
With grateful Joy thy thanks express;
And in this Consort bear thy part.
Psalm CIV.

Possessest Empire without Bounds,
With honor thou art crowned, thy Throne
Eternal Majesty surrounds.

And Glory for a Garment take:
Heaven's Curtains stretch beyond the Globe
Thy Canopy of State, to make.

His Palace-chambers in the Skies;
The Clouds his Chariot are, and Storms
The swift-wing'd Steeds with which he flies.

His Ministers heavens palace fill,
To have their sundry Tasks assigned;
All proud to serve their Sov'reigns Will.

Her Face with Waters overspread;
Nor proudest mountains dared, as yet,
To list above the waves their head

The Insulting waves dispersed; they fled
When once thy thunder's Voice they heard,
And by their haste confessed their dread.

And, gushing from the Mountain's side,
Through Valleys travel to the Deep,
Appointed to receive their Tide,

The threatening Surges to repel;
That they no more o'er-pass their mounds,
Nor to a second Deluge swell.
PART II.

The Sea recovers her lost hills,
And starting Springs from eve'ry Lawn,
Surprise the Vales with plenteous Rills.

Weary with Labor, faint with Drought,
And Asses on wild mountains bred,
Have sense to find these Currents out.

Yield shelter to the feathered Throng;
They drink and to, the Bounteous Streams
Return the Tribute of their Song.

That soon transmit the liquid; Store;
Till Earth is burdened with her Fruit,
And Nature's Lap can hold no more.

He makes the growth of every Field;
Herbs, for Man's use, of various power,
That either Food or Physic yield.

To cheer Man's heart oppressed with Cares;
Gives Oil that makes his Face to shine;
And Corn, that wasted Strength repairs.
PART III.

Or Art of Man, with Sap are fed;
The Mountain-Cedar looks as fair
As those in Royal Gardens bred.

The Wand'rers of the Air may rest:
The Hospitable Pine from Harms
Protects the Stork, her pious Guest.

It Is towering heights their Fortress make,
Whose Cells in Labyrinths extend,
Where feebler Creatures refuge take.

The Appointed Seasons of the Year;
The instructed Sun his Duty Knows,
His hours to rise, and disappear.

When Forest-Beasts securely stray;
Young Lions roar their Wants aloud
To providence, that sends'em Prey.

Till summoned by the rising Morn,
To skulck in Dens, with one consent,
The conscious Ravagers return.

The Husbandman securely goes,
Commencing with the Sun his Toil,
With him returns to his Repose.

For which thy Wisdom we adore!
The Earth is with thy Treasure crowned,
Till Nature's hand can grasp no more.
PART IV.

Of Wonders a new Scene supplies,
Whose Depths Inhabitants contain
Of every Form and every Size.

There cut their unmolested way;
Leviathan, whom there to sport
Thou made, has compass there to play.

In sense of common Want agree;
All wait on thy dispensing Hand,
And have their daily Alms from thee.

Without their trouble to provide;
Thou op'st thy hand, the Universe,
The craving World is all supplied.

The numerous Ranks of Creatures mourn,
Thou take their Breath, all Nature's Race
Forthwith to Mother-Earth return.

TO inspire the Mass with vital Seed;
Nature's restored, and Parent Earth
Smiles on her new created Breed.

Firm fixed thy Providential Care;
Pleased with the Work of thy own hands
Thou do the wastes of Time repair.

Earth's panting Breast with Terror fills;
One touch from thee, with Clouds of Smoke
In darkness shrouds the proudest hills.

My Breath, I will that Breath employ;

Sincere, as is in him my Joy.

My Soul, praise thou his holy Name,
Till, with my Song, the listening World
Join consort, and his praise proclaim.

What Mortal Eloquence can raise

Who know what is right, nor only so,
But always practice what they know.

That I the joyful Choir may join,
And count thy People's Triumph mine.

Of Parents vile, the viler Race;
Who their Misdeeds haved acted over,
And with new Crimes increased the Score?

On all his Works in Egypt wrought;
The Red Sea they no sooner viewed,
But they their base distrust renewed.

Once more to their Deliverance came;
To make his Sovereign Power be known,
That he is God, and he alone.

The parting Deep disclosed her sand;
Where firm and dry the Passage lay,
As through some parcht and desert way.

That proved the rash Pursuer's Graves.

O'erwhelms proud Pharaoh, Host and all;
This Proof did stupid Israel move

Did him with fresh Temptations press.

But made their Sin their Punishment.

With proud Abiram's factious Crew.

And to the molten Image prayed;

They changed their Glory to their Shame.

And all his works in Egypt wrought;

And where proud Pharoah's Troops were lost,

But Moses in the Breach appeared;
The Saint did for the Rebels pray,
And turned Heaven's kindled wrath away.

Nor his repeated Promise prized;

But when God said Go up, would stay.

To perish in the Wilderness;
Or else to be by Heathen hands
Overthrown, and scattered through the Lands.
PART III.

Became his impious Guests, and fed
On Sacrifices to the Dead.

It Is come: -- the deadly Pest is come
To execute their general Doom.
Phinehas, fired with holy Rage,

The Priesthood he so well did grace.
Meribath God's Wrath they moved
Who Moses for their sakes reproved;

Till rashly the meek Prophet spoke.
Canaan's Land,
Did they perform their Lord's Command,
Nor his commissioned Sword employ
The guilty Nations to destroy.

But mingling, learnt their Vices too;

Which them to fatal Snares betrayed.

Their Children with relentless Eyes,
Approached their Altars through a Flood
Of their own Son's and Daughters Blood.
No cheaper victims would appease
Canaan's remorseless Deities;
No Blood her Idols reconcile,
But that which did the Land defile.
PART IV.

The hardened Reprobates suffice;
For after their Heart's Lust they went,
And daily did new Crimes invent.

God's Wrath against his people drew,
Till he; their once indulgent Lord,
His own Inheritance abhorred.

To their insulting Heathen Foes;
And made them on the Triumphs wait,
Of those who bore them greatest Hate.

Their List of Tyrants he increased,
Till they, who God's mild Sway declined,
Were made the Vassals of Mankind.

His Anger did as often relent,
But freed, they did his Wrath provoke,
Renewed their Sins, and he their Yoke.

Nor heard their wretched Cries unmoved;

And Mercy's inexhausted Spring:

Even to their Foe's obdurate Heart,
And pity for their Sufferings bred
In those who them to Bondage led.

So to thy Name our thanks we'll raise,
And ever triumph in thy Praise.

Let all his Saints with full Accord,
Sing loud Amens -- Praise ye the Lord,
Psalm CVII.

Who does your daily Patron prove,
And let your never-ceasing praise
Attend on his eternal Love.

Of proud oppressing Foes released;
And brought them back from distant Lands,
From North and South, and West and East.

Nor could a peopled City find;
Till quite with Thirst and Hunger spent,
Their fainting Soul within them pined.

Did they their mournful Cry address;
Who graciously youchsasd to hear,
And freed them from their deep Disiress.

And in the certain way did guide,
To wealthy Towns of great resort,
Where all their Wants were well supplied.

Would God for this his Goodness praisc,
And for the mighty works which he
Thro-out the wondering world displays!

Of longing Souls with Pity views;
To hungry Souls that pant for Meat,
His Goodness daily Food renews.
PART II.

In deaths uncomfortable Shade;
And with unweildy Fetters bound,
By pressing Cares more heavy made;

And lightly prized his holy Word,
With these Afflictions they were tried;
They fell, and none could Help afford:

Did they their mournful Cry address;
Who graciously vouchs'd to hear,
And freed them from their deep Distress;

And Shades as black as Death's Abode,
He brought them forth to cheerful Light,
And welcome Liberty bestowed.

Would God for this his Goodness praise!
And for the mighty Works which he
Through out the wondering World displays.

The Gates of Brass in pieces broke;
Nor could the massy Brass withstand,
Or tempered Steel resist his. Stroke.
PART III.

With bold Ttansgressions God defy;
And for their multiplied Offense,
Opprett with fore Diseases lie:

Abhors, to taste the choicest Meats;
And they by faint Degrees draw near
To Death's inhospitable Gates.

Do they their mournful Cry address;
Who gracioufly vouchsases to hear,
And frees them from their deep Distress!

His Word both Health and Safety gives;
And when all human Succor fails,
From near Destruction them retrieves.

Would God for this his Goodness praise;
And for the mighty Works which he
Through out the wondering World display

Whilst they their grateful Thanks express,
And with loud Joy his holy Name
For all his Acts of wonder bless!
PART IV.

Over, sweliing Waves their Trade pursue;
Do God's amazing Works behold,
And in the Deep his Wonders view.

But forth a dreadful Tempest flies,
Which sweeps the Sea with rapid Haste,
And makes the stormy Billows rise:

On tops of mounting Waves appear;
Then down the sleep Abysa are driven;
Whilst every Soul disslves with fear.

Like Men with Fumes of Wine oppressed;
Nor do the skilful Seamen know,
Which way to sleer, whatCourse is best.

They do their mournful Cry address;
Who gracioufly vouchsases to hear,
And frees them from their deep Distress.

And makes the Billows calm and still;
With Joy they see their fury cease;
And their intended course fulfill.

Would God for this his Goodness praise!
And for the mighty Works, which he
Throughout the wondering World dispalys!

Advance to Heaven; his glorious Name,
And in the Elder's 'Sov'reign Court,
With one consent his praise proclaim!
PART V.

God's just Revenge, if People sin,
Will turn to dry and barren Ground,
To punish those that dwell therein.

To flow with Streams and springing Wells;
Which for his Lot the Hungry takes,
And in strong Cities fasely dwells.

Which gratefully his Toil repay;
Nor can, whiist God his Blessing grants,
His fruitful Seed or Stock decay.

His Health and Substance fade away.
He feels the Oppressor's gauling Yoke,
And is of Gries the wretched Prey,

Exposed to scorn, must quit his Throne;
And over wild and desert Lands,
Where no Path offers, stray alone.

Sets up the humble Man on high;
And makes in time his numerous Heirs
With his increasing Flocks to vie.

The just a decent Joy shall show;
The wise these strange Events shall weigh,
And thence God's Goodness fully know.
Psalm CVIII.

Yet what his Charity impairs,

The sweet Remembrance of the Just,
Shall flourish when he sleeps in Dust.

The Shipwreck of his Enemies.

Be sung by Slaves in foreign Lands?

Let then my trembling Hand forget
The speaking Strings with Art to move!

Or if I sing one cheerful Air,
Till thy Deliverance is my Song.

The Proud, far off, his scornful Eye
beholds with just neglect.

he shall my Foes disarm:
Relieve my Soul when most distressed,
and keep me safe from Harm!

shall fix my happy State;
and mindful of his Favors past,
shall his own Work complete.
Pslam CXXXIX.

My rising up, and lying down;
My secret Thoughts are known to thee,
Known long before conceived by me.

My public Haunts, and private Ways;

My yet-unnutter'd Words intent.

On every side I find thy Hand.

Too dazzling bright for mortal Eye!

To think of once deserting thee!
Where, Lord could I thy Influence shun,
Or whither from thy presence run?

It Is there thou dwellst, enthroned in light:
Or dive to Hell's insernal Plains,
It Is there Almighty Vengeance reigns,

And fly beyond the Western Main;

And there arrest thy Fugitive.

Beneath the sable Wings of night;
One glance from thee, one piercing Ray,
Would kindle Darkness into Day.

No Screen from thy all-searching Eyes;
Through midnight-Shades thou find'st thy way,
As in the plazing Noon of Day!
Thou know the Texture of my Heart,

Each single Thread, in Natute's Loom,
By thee was covered in the womb.

A Work of such a curious Frame;
The Wonders thou in me have shown,
My Soul with grateful Joy must own.

While yet a lifeless mass it lay
In secret, how exactly wrought,
Ever from its dark Enclosure brought.

Its parts were registered by thee;
Thou saw the daily growth they took,
Formed by the Model of thy Book.

That since this Maze of life I trod,
Thy thoughts of Love to me furmount
The power of Numbers to recount.

The Sands upon the Ocean's Shore:
Each Morn revising what I Have done,
I find the account but new begun.

Depart from me, ye men of Blood,

And take The Almighty's Name in vain.

Who thee with Enmity pursue?
And does not Grief my Heart oppress,
When Repobates thy Laws transgress?

Shall utmost Hatred have from me:
Such men I utterly detest,
As if they were my Foes prosest.

If mischief lurks in any part;
Correct me where I go astray,
And guide me in thy perfect way.
Psalm CXL.

on open Mischief bent.

Between their Lips the Gall of Asps
and Adders Venom breed.

nor leave my Soul forlorn,
A Prey to Sons of Violence,
who have my Ruin sworn.

and spread their wily Net;
With Traps and Gins where ever I move,
I sind my Steps beset.

thou art my God, I said;
Lord, hear my supplicating Voice
that calls to thee for Aid.

And covered my adventurous Head
in Battel's doubtful day.

Lest they encouraged by Success,
to bolder Crimes aspire.

The blast of their envenomed Breath,

The Pit they dug for me be made
their own untimely Tomb.

Their Rage does but the Torrent swell
that bears themselves away.

and speedy Succor give;
The Just shall celebrate his praise,
and in his Presence live.
Psalm CXLI.

O haste to my Relief:
And with accustomed Pity hear
the Accents of my Grief.

like Morning-Incense rise;
My listed Hands supply the place
of Evening Sacrifice.

and let a constant Guard
Still keep the Portal of my Lips
with wary Silence barred.

my Heart and Hands restrain;
Nor let me in the Booty share
of their unrighteous Gain.

and I shall think 'em kind,
Like Balm that heals a wounded Head,
I their Reproof shall find;
And, in return, my servent prayer
I shall for them address,
When they are tempted and reduced,
like me, fo sore Distress.
Engeddh's Rock,

If one reproachful Word I spoke,
when I had power to kill.

our scattered Ruins lie
As thick, as from the Hewer's Ax
the severed Splinters sly.

O leave not destitute my Soul,
whose Trust on thee relies!

that wicked Hands have laid;
Let them in their own Nets be caught,
while my Escape is made.
Psalm CXLII.

in deep Distress I prayed;

my Wrongs before him laid.

For where I thought to walk secure,
they had their Traps prepared.

to own me in Distress;
All Refuge failed, no man vouchsifd

My portion in the Land of Life,
till Life it sels depart.

to thee I make my moan,
O! save me from oppressing Foes,
for me too powerful grown.

my Soul from Prison bring;
Whilst of thy kind Regard to me
assembled Saints shall sing.
Psalm CXLIII.

thy wonted Audience lend;
In thy accustomed Faith and Truth
a gracious Answer send.

thy servant to betry'd
For in thy sight no living Man
can ever be justified.

whose Comforts all are sled;
He drives me into Caves as dark
as Mansions of the dead.

and sinks within ray Breast;
My mournful Heart grows desolate,
with heavy Woes oppressed.

and Wonders thou have wrought:
My former Dangers and Escapes
employ my musing Thought.

I fervently stretch out;
My Soul for thy resreshment thirsts,
like Land oppressed with Drought.

thy Face no longer hide,
Left I become forlorn like them
that in the Grave reside.

whose Trust on thee depends;
Teach me the Way where I should go:
my Soul to thee ascends.

A safe Retreat against their Rage,

Let thy good Spirit condust and keep
my Soul in thy right way.

For thy Truth's'sake, to me distressed;
thy promised Aid impart,

reduce my Foes to shame;
Slay tham that persecute a Soul
devoted to thy Name.
Psalm CXLIV

Who does his needful Aid impart,
At once both Strength and Skill assord
To weild my Arms with warlike Art.

My strong Deliverance and my Shield;
In him I trust, whose matchless Power
Makes to my sway fierce Nations yield.

Of him such tender Care to take?
What in his Offspring could thee move
Such great Account of him to make?

His Thoughts but empty are, and vain;
His Days are like a slying Shade,
Of whose short stay no Signs remain.

Whilst Heaven its losty Head inclines;
The smoking Hills asounder rend,
Of thy Approach the awful Signs.

And make my scattered Foes retreat;
Them with thy pointed Arrows wound.
And their Destruction soon complete.

Thy boundless Power my Foes to quell;
And snatch me from the stormy Rage
Of threatening Waves that proudly swell.
Fight thou against my foreign Foes,
Who utter Speeches false and vain;
Who though in solemn Leagues they close,
Their sworn Engagement never maintain.

In new-made Hymns my Voice shall raise,
And Instruments of various Strings
Shall help me thus to sing thy praise.

"to them his sure Salvation sends;
"It Is he that from the murdering Sword
"His Servant David still desends.

Who utter Speeches false and vain,
Who, though in solemn Leagues they close,
Their sworn Engagement never maintain.

Well planted in some fruitful place;
Our Daughters shall like Pillars show,
Designed some royal Court to grace.

Shall us and ours with Plenty feed;
Our Sheep increasing more and more,
Shall thousands and ten thousands breed.

Nor in their constant Labor faint;
Whilst we no War, nor Slavery know,
and in our Streets hear no Complaint.

Whose various Blessings thus abound,
Who God's true Worship stili embrace,
And are with his Protection crowned.
Psalm CXLV.

This Tribute daily I will bring,

PART II.

and makes the prostrate rise:
For his kind Aid all Creatures call,
who timely food supplies;

with open Hand he gives;
And so fulfills the just Desire
of every thing that lives.

how righteous all his ways!
How nigh to him, who with firm Trast,
for his Assistance prays!

And, will their Troubles soon compose,
when they his Aid implore.

But Sinners who his Vengeance dare,

And all Mankind with one Consent

Psalm CXLVI.

for ever bless his Name:
His wondrous Love, while Life shall last,
my constant Praise shall claim.

let none for Aid rely;
They cannot save in dangerous times,
nor timely help apply.

and there neglected lie,
And all their Thoughts and vain Designs
together with them die.
Jacob's God

Who still, with well-plac'd Hope, the Lord
his constant Refuge makes.

and all that they contain,
Will never quit his steadfast Truth,
nor make his Promise vain.

With kind regard and tender Love

From Age to Age his Reign endures,

Psalm CXLVII.

and celebrate his Fame;
For pleasant, good, and comely it is
to praise his holy Name,

though levelled with the Ground;
Bring back his People, though dispersed
through all the Nations round.

and all their, wounds does close;
He tells the number of the Stars,
their several Names he knows.

The meek he raises, but throws down
the wicked to the Ground.

To Songs of Triumph tune the Harp,
and strike each warbling String.

refreshing Rain bestows.
Through him, on Mountain-tops, the Grass
with wondrous Plenty grows.

with timely food supplies;
He feeds the Raven's tender Brood,
and stops their hungry Cries.

but does his Strength disdain;
The nimble Foot that swiftly runs,
no Prize from him can gain.

his tender Love extends;
To him that on his boundless Grace
with steadfast Hope depends.
Sion and Jerus'lem then,
to God their Praise address;
Who fenced their Gates with massle Bars,
and does their Children bless.

with finest Wheat they are sed;
He speaks the Word, and what he wills
is done as soon as said,

And hoary Frost, like Ashes spread,
is scattered over the land.

Who can againsst his Piercing Cold
secure Defenses make?

he makes his Wind to blow,
And soon the Streams, congealed before,
in plenteous Currents flow.

to Jacob's Sons were shown;
And still to Israel's chosen Seed
his righteous Laws are known.

nor did he ever afford
To heathen Lands his Oracles,
and Knowledge of his Word.
Hallelujab.
Psalm CXLVIII.

Exalt your Maker's Fame;
His praise your Song employ
Above the starry Frame:
Your Voices raise,
Ye Cherubim
And Seraphim,
To sing his Praise.

And Sun that guid'st the Day,
Ye glittering Stars of Light,
To, him your Homage pay:
His praise declare
Ye Heavens above,
And Clouds that move
In liquid Air.

And praise his holy Name,
By whose Almighty Word
They all from nothing came.
And all shall last
From Changes free
His firm Decree
Stands ever fast.

Praise him, ye dreadful Whales,
And Fish that through the Sea
Glide swist with glittering Scales,
Fire, Hail, and Snow,
And misty Air,
And Winds that, where
He bids them, blow.

In grateful Consort joined)
By Cedars stately tall,
And Trees for Fruit designed:
By every Beast,
And creeping thing,
And Fowl of Wing,
His Name be blessed.

With those of humbler Frame;
And Judges of the Earth,
His matchless Praise proclaim.
In this Design
Let Youths with Maids,
And hoary Heads
With Children join.

His wondrous Fame to raise,
Whose glorious Name alone
Deserves our endless Praise.
Earth's, utmost Ends
His Power obey:
His glorious Sway
The Sky transcends.

He sets them up on high,
And savours Ifrael's Race
Who still to him are nigh,
O therefore raise
Your grateful voice.
And still rejoice
The Lord to praife.
Psalm CXLIX.

His Praise in the great
Assembly to sing.
In our great Creator

And Children of Sion
be glad in their King.

Who always takes pleasure

And with his Salvation

his People shall sing
To God, who their Beds
with Safety does shield;
Their Mouths filled with Praises
of him their great King;
Whilst a two-edged Sword
their Right Hand shall wield.

for Injuries past;
To punish those Lands
for Ruin designed;
With Chains, as their Captives,
to tie their Kings fast,
With Fetters of Iron
their Nobles to bind.

when them they destroy,
The dreadful Decree
which God does proclaim:
Such Honor and Triumph
his Saints shall enjoy.
O therefore for ever
exalt his great Name.
Psalm CL.

Fromwhence his Goqdness largeiy flows;
Praife him in Heaven, where he his Face
Unveiled in perfect Glory shows.

Which he in our behals has done
His Kindness this Return exacts,
With which our Praise should equal run.

Make Rocks and Hills his Praise rebound;
Praise him with Harp's melodious Noise,
And gentle Psaltry's sver Sound.

And some with graceful Motion dance;
Let Instruments of various Strings,
With Organs joined his Praise advance.

To Cymbals set their Songs of Praise;
Cymbals of common use, and those
That loudly ssound on solemn Days.

The Breath he does to them afford,
In just return of Praise employ;
Let every Creature praise the Lord.
