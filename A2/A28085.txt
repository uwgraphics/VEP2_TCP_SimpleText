Cornehill, 1641.

A Confession of Faith.
I Believe that nothing is without beginning but God, no nature, no matter, no
spirit but one and the same God; That God as he is eternal, almighty, only
wise, only good in his nature, so he is eternal Father, Son and Spirit in
persons.

I believe that God is so holy, pure, and jealous, as it is impossible for him
to be pleased in any creature, though the work of his own hands: So that
neither Angel, Man, nor World, could stand or can stand one moment in his
eyes, without the beholding of the same in the face of a Mediator; and
therefore that before him, with whom all things are present, the Lamb of God
was slain before all worlds, without which eternal council of his it was
impossible for him to have descended to any work of creation, but he should
have enjoyed the blessed and individual society of three Persons in Godhead
only forever. But that out his eternal and infinite goodness and love,
purposing to become a Creator, and communicate with his creatures, he ordained
in his eternal council, that one person of the Godhead should be united to
one nature, and to one particular of his creatures, that so in the person of
the Mediator the true ladder might be fixed, whereby God might descend to his
creatures, and his creatures ascend unto him: So that God by the reconcilement
of the Mediator, turning his countenance toward his creatures, (though not in
the same light and degree) made way unto the dispensation of his most holy and
secret will; whereby some of his creatures might stand and keep their state,
others might fall and be restored, and others might fall and not be restored in
their state, but yet remain in their being, though under wrath and
corruption, all with respect unto the Mediator; which is the great mystery,
and perfect center of all Gods ways with his creatures, and unto which all his
other works and wonders do but serve and refer.

That he chose (according to his good pleasure) man to be that creature, to
whose nature the person of the eternal Son of God should be united: And
amongst the generations of men, elected a small flock, in whom (by the
participation of himself) he purposed to express the riches of his glory: all
the ministration of Angels, damnation of Devils and Reprobates, and universal
administration of all creatures, and dispensation of all times, having no other
end, but, as the ways and ambages of God, to be further glorified in his
Saints, who are one with the Mediator, who is one with God.

That by the virtue of this his eternal council touching a Mediator, he
descended at his own good pleasure, and according to the times and seasons to
himself known, to become Creator, who by his eternal Word created all
things, and by his eternal Spirit does comfort and preserve them.

That he made all things in their first estate good, and removed from himself
the beginning of all evil and vanity unto the liberty of the creature, but
reserved in himself the beginning of all restitution, to the liberty of his
grace, using nevertheless, and turning the falling and defection of the
creature, (which was to his prescience eternally known) to make way to his
eternal council touching a Mediator, and the work he purposed to
accomplish in him.

That God created Spirits, whereof some kept their standings and others fell,
he created Heaven and Earth, and all their Armies, and Generations, and gave
them constant and everlasting laws which we call nature, which is nothing but
the laws of the creation; which laws nevertheless have had three changes or
times, and are to have a fourth or last: The first, when the matter of heaven
and earth was created without forms. The second, the interim of perfection of
every days work. The third, by the curse, which notwithstanding was no new
creation: And the last at the end of the world, the manner whereof is not yet
fully revealed: So that the laws of nature which remain, and now govern
inviolably till the end of the world, began to be in force when God first
rested from his works, and ceased to create; but received a revocation in part
by the curse, since which time they change not.

That notwithstanding God has rested and ceased from Creation since the first
Sabbath, yet, nevertheless, de does accomplish and fulfill his divine will in
all things, great and small, singular and general, as fully and exactly by
providence, as he could by miracle and new creation, though his working be not
immediate and direct, but by compass; not violating nature, which is his own
law upon the creature.

That at the first the soul of man was not produced by heaven or earth, but
was breathed immediately from God; so that the ways and proceedings of God with
Spirits, are not included in nature, in the laws of heaven and earth, but are
reserved to the law of his secret will and grace, wherein God works still,
and rests not from perfecting the work of redemption, as he rests from the
work of creation, but continues working till the end of the world; what time
that work also shall be accomplished, and an eternal Sabbath shall ensue.
Likewise, that whenever God does transcend the law of nature by miracles,
(which may ever seem as new creations) he never comes to that point or
pass, but in regard of the work of redemption which is the greater, and
whereto all Gods signs and miracles do refer.

That God created man in his own Image, in a reasonable soul, in innocence,
in free will and soveraigntie: That he gave him a Law and Commandment which was
in his power to keep, but he kept it not: That man made a total defection
from God, presuming to imagine that the Commandments and prohibitions of God,
were not the rules of good and evil, but that good and evil had their own
principles and beginnings; and lusted after the knowledge of those supposed
beginnings, to the end to depend no more upon Gods will revealed, but upon
himself and his own light as a God, then which there could not be a sin more
opposite to the whole Law of God: That yet nevertheless this great sin was not
originally moved by the malice of man, but was insinuated by the suggestion and
instigation of the Devil, who was the first defective creature, and fell of
malice and not by temptation from another.

That upon the fall of man, death and vanity entered by the Justice of God, and
the Image of God in man was defaced, and heaven and earth which were made for
man's use, were subdued to corruption by his fall: But then that instantly and
without intermission of time, after the word of Gods Law became, through the
fall of man, frustrate, as concerning obedience, there succeeded the greater
word of the promise, that the righteousness of God might be wrought by faith.

That as well the Law of God, as the Word of his promise endure the same for
ever; but that they have been revealed in several manners, according to the
dispensation of times: For the Law was first imprinted in that remnant of light
of nature which was left after the fall, being sufficent to accuse; then it was
more manifestly expressed in the written Law; and was yet more opened by the
Prophets, and lastly expounded in the true perfection by the Son of God, the
great Prophet and perfect interpreter of the Law.

That likewise the word of the promise was manifested and revealed, first by
immediate revelation and inspiration, after by figures, which were of two
natures; the one the Rites and Ceremonies of the Law, the other the continual
History of the old world, and the Church of the Jews, which though it be
literally true, yet it is for the most part pregnant of an Allegory and shadow
of the work of the redemption to follow: The same promise or Evangel, was more
clearly revealed and declared by the Prophets, and then by the Son himself,
and lastly by the holy Ghost, which illuminateth the Church to the end of the
world.

That in the fullness of time, according to the promise and oath, of a chosen
lineage descended the blessed seed of the Woman, Jesus Christ, the only
begotten Son of God, and Savior of the world, who was conceived by the power
and over-shadowing of the holy Ghost, and took flesh of the Virgin Mary. That
the Word did not only take flesh, of was joined to flesh, but was made flesh,
though without confusion of substance or nature; so that the eternal Son of
God, and blessed Son of Mary was one person: So as the blessed Virgin may be
truly and Catholickly called Deipara, the Mother of God; so one, as there is no
unity in universal nature, not that of the soul and body of man, so perfect:
For the three heavenly unities, whereof that is the second, exceed all natural
unities; the unity first of the three persons in the Godhead: secondly, of
God and man in Christ: thirdly, of Christ and the Church, the holy Ghost being
the worker of both these latter unities, for by the holy Ghost was Christ
incarnate and quickened in the flesh, and by the holy Ghost is man regenerate
and quickened in the spirit.

That Jesus the Lord became in the flesh a sacrificer and sacrifice for sin,
a satisfaction to the Justice of God, a meritor of glory and the Kingdom, a
pattern of all righteousness, a Preacher of the Word which himself was, a
finisher of the Ceremonies, a Corner stone to remove the separation between Jew
and Gentile, an Intercessor for the Church, a Lord of nature in his miracles, a
Conqueror of death and the power of darkness in his resurrection; and that he
fulfilled the whole Council of God, performed all his sacred offices and
anointing on earth, accomplished the whole work of redemption and restitution
of man's nature to an estate superior to the Angels, (whereas the state of man
by creation was inferior) and reconciled and established all things according
to the eternal will of the Father.

That in time, Jesus the Lord was borne in the days of Herod, and suffered
under the government of Ponce Pilate being deputy of the Romans, and under the
high Priesthood of Caiphas, was betrayed by Judas one of the twelve Apostles,
and was crucified at Jerusalem, and after a true and natural death, and his
body laid in the sepulcher, the third day he raised himself from the bond of
death, and rose and showed himself to many chosen witnesses by the space of
diverse days, and at the end of those days, in the sight of many, ascended
into heaven, where he continues his intercession, and shall from thence at the
day appointed, come in great glory to judge the world.

That the sufferings and merits of Christ as they are sufficient to do away the
sins of the whole world, so they are only effectual to those which are
regenerate by the holy Ghost, who breaths where he will of free grace, which
grace, as a seed incorruptible, quickneth the spirit of man, and conceives him
anew, a son of God, and member of Christ; so that Christ having man's flesh, and
man having Christ's spirit, there is an open passage and mutual imputation,
whereby sin and wrath was conveyed to Christ from man, and merit and life
conveyed from Christ to man, which seed of the holy Ghost figureth in us the
Image of Christ slain or crucified, in mortification through a lively faith,
and then renews in us the Image of God in holiness and charity; though both
imperfectly and in degrees far differing, even in Gods elect, as well in
regard of the fire of the spirit, as of the illumination which is more or less
in a large proportion, as namely in the Church before Christ, which yet
nevertheless was partaker of one and the same salvation with us.

That the work of the spirit though it be not tied to any means in heaven or
earth, yet it is ordinarily dispensed by the preaching of the word,
administration of the Sacraments, Covenants of the fathers upon the children,
prayer, reading, the censures of the Church, society of the godly, crosses and
afflictions, Gods benefits, his Judgments upon others, miracles, and the
contemplation of his creatures, all which, though some be more principal and
perpetual, God uses as the means of vocation and conversion of his Elect, not
derogating from his power to call immediately by his grace, and at all hours and
moments of the day (that is of man's life) according to his good pleasure.

That the word of God, whereby his will is revealed, continued in revelation
and tradition until Moses, and that the Scriptures were from Moses time, to
the times of the Apostles and Evangelists, in whose age, when after the coming
of the holy Ghost, the teacher of all truth, they had delivered the tradition
of Scripture, the book of the Scripture was shut and closed, so as not to
receive any new addition: And that the Church has no power over the
Scriptures, to teach or command any thing contrary to the written word, but is
as the Arc wherein the tables of the first Testament were kept and preserved,
that is to say, the Church has only the custody and delivery over of the
Scriptures committed unto the same, together with the interpretation of them,
but such only as is conceived by themselves.

That there is an universal or Catholic Church of God dispersed over the
face of the earth, which is Christ's Spouse and body, being gathered of the
Fathers of the old world, of the Church of the Jews, of the spirits of the
faithful dissolved, of the spirits of the faithful militant, and of the names
yet to be borne which are already written in the book of life. That there is
also a visible Church distinguished by the outward works of Gods Covenant, and
the receiving of the holy Doctrine, with the use of the mysteries of God and
the invocation and sanctification of his holy name, together with regeneration
by his spirit. That there is also a holy succession in the Prophets of the new
Testament, and Fathers of the Church from the time of the Apostles and
Disciples, which saw our Savior in the flesh, unto the consummation of the
work of the Ministry, which persons are called from God by gifts or inward
anointing, and this vocation of God followed by an outward calling and
ordination of the Church.

I believe that the souls of those that dye in the Lord are blessed, and rest
from their labors, and enjoy the sight of God, yet so as they are in
expectation of a further consummation of glory in the last day, at which time
all flesh of man shall arise and be changed, and shall appear and receive from
Jesus Christ his eternal judgment, and the glory of the Saints shall then be
full, and the kingdom shall be given up to God the Father, from which time all
things shall continue for ever in that being and state which then they shall
receive.

So as there are three times or parts of eternity, (if so they may be called)
The first, the time before beginnings, when the Godhead was only without the
being of any creature: The second, the time of the mystery which continues
from the creation to the dissolution of the world; And the third, the time of
the revelation of the sons of God, which time is the last, and is everlasting
without change.

FINIS.
