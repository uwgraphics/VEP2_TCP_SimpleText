WHereas one Thomas Percy, a Gentleman Pensioner to his Majesty, is discovered
to have been privy to one of the most horrible Treasons that ever was
contrived, that is, to have blown up this day, while his Majesty should have
b^ene in the upper House of the Parliament, attended with the Queen, the
Prince, all his Nobility and the Commons, with Gunpowder (for which purpose a
great quantity of Powder was conveyed in^o a Vault under the said Chamber,
which is this morning there found) the Chamber where they should be assembled,
which Perry is fithens sted:

These are to will and command all our Offices and loving Subjects whatsoever,
to do that which we doubt not but they will willingly perform according to
the former experience we have had of their love and zeal toward us, That is,
to make all diligent search for the said Perty, and him to apprehend by all
possible means, especially to keep him alive, to the end the rest of the
Conspiratours may be discovered. The said Perty is a tall man, with a great
broad beard, a good face, the color of his beard and head mingled with white
hairs, but the head more white then the beard, he stoupeth some what in the
shoulders, well colored in the face, long footed, small legged.

Given at our Palace of Westminster, the fist day of November 1605. in the
third year of our reign of Great Britain.
