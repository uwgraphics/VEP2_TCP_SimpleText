A Proclamation against abuses in preparing and preferring Bills and other
Writings to his Majesty's Signature.
THe Kings most excellent Majesty, obserning the inordinate liberty that has
been taken, chiefly of late times, in exhibiting to his Royal Signature, as
well Bills to pass his great and privy Seal, and warrants for preparing
such Bills, as also Letters, and other instruments, and writings of sundry
natures, drawn by Scriueners, and other like persons, and not by his Majesty's
Officers, to whom the care thereof appertains, whereof ensues a continual
vexation to his Majesty, and many times exceeding danger and prejudice both in
his revenue and otherwise, Is fully resolved to abolish those abuses, which
have of late years crept into his service, and to reduce it to the ancient
order and institution. And therefore his Majesty does hereby straightly charge
and command, That no person or persons whatsoever (other then his Majesty's
own ordinary Officers, to whose places it appertains) do at any time
hereafter presume to intermeddle with the drawing, writing, or preparing for
his Majesty's Signature, of any Bill, Warrant, Letter, or other instrument or
Writing whatsoever, upon pain of his Majesty's indignation and displeasure,
and such imprisonment and other punishment as may justly be inflicted for their
contempt: And that no person or persons, under the like pain, presume to
prefer to his Majesty to be signed any such Bill, Warrant, Letter, or other
instrument or writing, not drawn or allowed by such his Majesty's ordinary
Officers, and by them signed and docqueted, in cases where the like instruments
have heretofore been used to be signed and dorqueted: And that none of his
Majesty's own Officers, do presume to draw or prepare for his Highness
Signature, any Bill, Warrant, Letter, or other instrument or writing, until
they have received direction to draw the same, either by some signification of
his Majesty's own Royal pleasure, or by Warrant from such as have been
accustomed and allowed to give such Warrant, upon pain of his Majesty's
displeasure, and to be debarred from the exercise and execution of their
offices and places for such their default and abuse.

Given at his Majesty's Court at Roiston, the seventh day of October, in the
nineteenth year of His Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

most Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXI.
