TO MY HONOVR'D FRIEND, Sir KENELME DIGBIE, Knight.
WEre it not well known to me, and more clearly to some singularly literate
men, endowed with sublime wits (with whom great is your name) whose ingenuity,
doctrine, judgment, and justice I have not without cause) in high esteem.
Were it not that the voices of all those Scholars who have occasionarily
conversed with you, testify your great gifts by nature, your enrichments by
industry, methodically commenced in the Latin, Greek, and the mystical
Languages (rare instruments of universal knowledge) prosecuted in the liberal
Sciences, perfected in the high and divine. I say your propitious nature, your
named addictions, with attentions not ordinarily found in any so intensive,
yea, and so immersed, by which the accomplishment of them, as also almost of
all speculative and practique has been by you rarely acquired. Were you not
known to be a great Animater to Learning, and hence affect and cherish all the
ways to the acquisition of it in favor of them, who yet are to be bred; were
there not yet over and above manifestations of your courteous respects to our
family, my notable encouragement among these so many foresaid.

I should not have been so bold to have presented this, alas, poor
Introductory offering, so far below you, so richly in this and other
excellent parts endowed.

And lest yet I prove too too hardy in my presumptuous importunities upon the
precedent named. I here crave humbly that I may under your wings coverture
deliver these not formerly received in our kingdom, to this our countries
view; yet such, as I am no ways diffident, but will square to true,
authentic, and genuine Latin construction, with evident perspicuitie, and
easy manuduction, therefore profitable and full of encouragement to youth. All
which will clearly appear to your worthy self, as singular helps, I say, to
those who are not arrived to the habit of Latin construction.

Let but the luster of your incomparably endowed self appear favorable to my
labors, and many sollicitudes in this little compiled piece, then will Momists
snarles easily be checked, nipt, and intelligent men (such as are not
preiudicated) to whose judgments I humbly submit my self, will not disdain
the reading hereof, were it that they were solely allured by your acceptance.
For further abilities cannot they acquire by this low subject. Language already
in them being spunged up from authentic Authors true fountains.

And though small be my present, yet may not I give the attribute of the entire
piece to my self. Should I be bold herein, it must necessarily be that I were
a betrayer of the Truth. Though I may well say that I have not been idle. The
most part of the Regimen, as you read it in Latin, was compiled by Nebrixa (a
rare professor of Salamanca) His Spanish Comment, vindicatory of his texts
truth, I turned into English. Yet have I strengthened the one and the other
diversely, and in many places.

Whatsoever concerns Concordance is mine, there being not found in the said
Nebrixa, such as might ought profit, or exceeding little.

The total cutting off the figures of Construction has been my attention;
which I have wrought to release the learner from innecessary perplexities:
which both the truth and profit will plainly appear to the intelligent, and
will facilitate the ignorants task.

The further reasons of all will appear in the Preface which is drawn, at my
request, by a friend, well versed in the learned Languages, importuned by me to
confront the Latin with them. Upon assurance was my request that there would
be found consonance and harmony in this Latin Language and them. I am
satisfied in my friends integrity therein, that so they are found.

Be you (worthy Sir) judge who are expert in them. And were it that the Latin
Syntaxe should appear diverse from the construction of those Languages; yet
notwithstanding, so delivered as it is, The Latin will answer in its true
fountain completely for it self.

Thus wishing happiness, and all graces to your worthy self, Noble Sir, I
humbly take my leave.

Yours in all due respect: IOH. HAWKINS.

THE PREFACE to the READER.
IF that be true which the Orator writes in his first Book, De Finibus,
saying, that those who use liberality, get themselves good will: and (which is
most important to live in quiet, Love: I hope, yea am confident (courteous
Reader) that both these will not be wanting to this worthy Author, both in
regard of the goodness of his cause, and the wisdom of thy Judgment. For if
you turn over all the writings both of ancient and modern in this kind, you
will not find any who communicates his knowledge more liberally and
bountifully, I add more willingly and courteously; only desiring to deserve
well of such as shall please to make use of these his useful labors. Well in
this case has Ennius counseled, That what good may be done without our own
de^riment and loss, must not be denied even to strangers, and such as are
unknown to us. Nor are the gates of the Muses unlike to those of Hecale, which
ever open made (...), An ever open house of bounty, according to Callimachus,
their breasts as free from envy at others good, as full of desire to promote
any thing commodious for their progress. And let thy breast (good Reader) be
open in receiving what is here laid down, thy mind courteous and well
opinionated, and thy judgment and candid censure void of all malice. Be alike
loving to him, whom the love of thy commodity has drawn to these labors, and
the apprehension of a certain way and means wholly confirmed. For although
the Author hereof is rather desirous to instruct such as desire it, then blame
any other, yet must he needs confess, what with others he cannot but
acknowledge, that of so many, very few have either so far as is requisite
delivered the knowledge hereof, or with such perplexity, as that the over
tediousness of it has proved too often the utter discouragement and confusion
of the learner. Well says the Arabian, (...) The luster of speech consists
in brevity. And the same being true in the deliverie of any art, being done
without obscurity: it may well be esteemed and judged, how much the Author
hereof ( absit verbis invidia) has excelled all in this kind, as being not
only brief in deliverie of rules, but also by the same having quite cut off
and solved all grammatical figures, so great impediments of the quick
progress of the learner, and the causes of so much incertainty and ambiguity,
either in understanding or writing. And verily if we take a view of other
languages, wherein the Authors of grammar neither trouble themselves nor their
Readers in like manner, we shall find as hard constructions as may be found in
Latin, solved by genericke rules. As what reason have we to say that this
Saucis frontem is necessarily by Synecd. more then that of Homer, Il. a. (...)
Iratus cor, for cord: or of Nazianz. (...) Deus quidnam sit naturam and rem,
for natura and re? Or not to solve this, Omnes laudare, etc. by a common rule,
as well as the Hebrews do the like: (...), and animalia ire and redire,
(...): that is as if one would say, Currebant and rediba^t, sive [erant]
currentes and redeuntes, or by a subintellection of an Indicative to the
Infinitive: Currendo currebant, redeundo redibant. Or that this Sic ore locuta
est, is a greater redundancie then that which is common to the Syrians, and in
particular used, Luke. 2.4. (...), Ex domo eius and familia eius Davidis: i. Ex
domo and familia Davidis. Or the use of the adiective for the adverbe, more
figurative then of the mere adiective for a Substantive usual in Arabique, as
(...), Vniversitas hominis, id est, omnes homines. But if we should speak of
the discordance (yet concordance) of the Nominative case and the Verb, in
number and gender common to the Hebrews and Chaldaeans, the putting of the
Future for the Participle, often used by the Syrians and Arabians, with many
other kinds of speech no less usual, we may very well conclude, that as by
general rule such constructions no less difficult then in Latin are solved,
and supplied; so in Latin with more brevitie by the like means may they well
be satisfied.

2. Whereas in delivery of any Art, not only truth, but a certain (...), or
congruitie of the precepts, as proper to the Art is required. For an absurdity
it were in Geometry, to teach Arithmetike; or in Grammar, Logic. Surely they
err, who in Grammar induce Prolepsis, Epanalepsis, Hyperbaton, and many other,
being (as to one well considering may easily appear) figures proper to
Rhetorique.

3. Whereas all precepts ought to be proper, that is things general to be
spoken generally and once, things particular and special more often and
specially, as to make it plain by this similitude. Sleep is a natural affect
common to a man and a beast. If the natural Philosopher therefore should
explicate this affect in a man and a beast, specially taken, he should do
amiss, because he should repeat a thing which generally might be said and
satisfied. The cause of error in this kind, Cicero 2. de Legib. under the
person of Lawyers thus expresses. Lawyers, says he, either to breed a
mistake in their Auditors, whereby they may seem to know things more in
number, and more hard, and difficult, or (which is more likely) through the
ignorance of teaching, often infinitely dissipate that which consists in one
notion. Against this some Grammarians have offended in delivering a
construction by rule, and after making the same figurative, as in Pars abiere,
in one place by rule, in another by Synthesis: In criminibus terrere novis, by
rule of subintellection, and Enallage, etc. In which act (me thinks) they
imitate that Medea, whom the Poets say in her flight out of Pontus to have
scattered the limbs of her Brother in those places, by which her Father
followed her, so forcing pity out of an impious act, and by the enforced
collection of them foreslowing his just and desired revenge: so have the parts
of this Art been dissipated, so have the species been placed without their
Genera, and both confounded, that what by some things was meant, whereto others
did appertain, could hardly be discerned. Whereby all speed in attaining any
perfection in these kinds of studies was not only hindered, but even all hope
was utterly taken away.

Whereas to know aright according to that great light of knowledge (even
Aristotle himself) is (...), to know the first grounds, or primary causes;
this in regard of prepositions expressed, or with other parts together
understood, has been qu^te left untoucht by other Grammarians, being here
without comparison excellently expressed: to the great benefit and assurance of
the Learner. And so well laid down, that whether I seek brevitie, propriety
both in the matter and manner of the deliverie, certainty, (things being
examined according to their first grounds and causes) or in a word whatsoever
is requisite to this useful and necessary Art: I am enforced to say of this,
what the Ithacan feared not to pronounce of his assisting Pallas. Hom. Odyss.
(...)
(...).
So is whatsoever may be required fully satisfied, so does fullness of matter
seem to contend with right order. So is brevitie joined with perspicuity, that
I may well say of the Author, what is commended by an ancient Father, He knew,
to the end to edify and profit others.

Now if we should a little consider the learned Languages, I mean the Latin,
Greek, Hebrew, Chaldaie, Syriaque, and Arabique together, as we shall find some
Idioms and proprieties of every one in particular; so shall we find them in
most points of construction (for of Etymology I say nothing) to agree
together. That of all these the Hebrew was most ancient, besides Christians,
Targum Hiersol. Genesis 11.1. averreth in these words: (...) that is, And all men
of the earth were of one language, and one speech, for they spoke in the holy
or Hebrew tongue. And the Jews Thalmud, Tract. Sanhedrin, cap. 23. In the
beginning was the Law given to Israel in the Hebrew tongue. But when they were
in banishment in the time of Esdras, they took the Assyrian Character, and
Language, and left to the Samaritanes the Hebrew. From the Hebrew corrupted
proceeded the Chaldaie, Syriaque, and Arabique. Now as man was first created in
the East, and therein the Church first planted; so from hence were letters
first derived, and the use of them brought into other Nations (as if a man say
(...), etc. he speaks Chaldaie) Read the learned Tractates, De dijs Syris,
and Sacer Aristarchus, you will confess, that even the religious of the
Greeks and Latins (to say nothing of other) came out of the East, and that so
much as the names of the gods cannot otherwise be understood, then by the
Eastern tongues. And as from these Languages are derived into the Latin, and
Greek, diverse words, some of which you may find noted by the learned
Caninius, So does the construction of all these for the most part agree. Let
these therefore learn -- Risu cognoscere matrem. To imitate the other, and
without such abundance of figures, creeping in by constructions less usual,
but in the other Languages no less usual, as well as the other to be taught.

It is recorded in the Jews Thalmud Tract. Bava bathra (or acording to them
Basra) cap. 2. that there were two Schoolemasters, whereof one taught many
things, but had no care of his Scholars how and how much they learned: The
other taught few things, but was exceeding careful of their progress, which
they explicate briefly and sententiously thus: (...). The one read and took no
care: the other took care and read not. The same, me thinks, I see here
imitated. Other Grammarians not regarding the time in learning, or the
difficulty in retaining, have delivered multiplicity of rules, and added
unnecessarie matter, which our Author attending the commodity of the learner,
has more wisely, and with better reason quite cut off. And desiring indeed
rather to profit then to arrogate any thing to himself, he cert^fies the
Reader that the Regimen herein contained is translated (for the most part) out
of Spanish, written therein by one Aelius Antonius of Nehrissa, by the command
of Philip the third. The notes ^nferring the more learned Languages added by
one who has vowed and dedicated his service to so worthy a Gentleman. The
Concordance for the better perfecting of the whole with the supplying of
figures, adjoined by himself.

For these reasons (gentle Reader) kindly interpret this excellent Labor of
this worthy Author, intended for thy better progress, which if he find
willingly, and gratefully received, you shall not only move, but oblige and
bind him to labor in other things necessary to the same. Farewell, and to
speak with Virgil: Et nos, and tua dexter adi pede sacra secundo.

All future strifes, and endless concord made.
Rare victory which joy and peace does bring,
Whence to the Foe overcome, such ease may spring.

Ars haec, art tua, reparatur: te ergo negaret

WHat mar's young wits, what drives them in their prime,
From getting Knowledge, is it not things sublime?
And passing their capacities which make
Some borne for Arts, inferior courses take.
This seen, the Author did himself apply
To give this groundwork such facility,
Whereby wits weak through Authors deep may wade:
No Comments used, rules hard so plain are made.
Grammar's unmasked. What is not here discerned?
Read, reap much fruit, ye less, and better learned.

To my noble friend, the Author, upon his worthy and useful Work.
WHat time is lost, what wit vex't' what health spent,
Only in search of things impertinent?
What war among critics raised, to reconcile
Some little difference both in speech and style,
So that in this war too, our costs and pain
Are more to get the outworks, then the main.
Then your great Oracle Hippocrates
His truth and knowledge fully did express,
When he said life was short, and Art was long,
You who know all his Art, and know the wrong
Our minds and bodies suffer in such strife,
And study for the perfect use of life,
In opening us this secret, shall do more,
Even for our health, then Art could do before.
Since those rough ways, our youth has past with pain,
Are by your noble industry made plain.
I. G.

VMbris Roma novos redit en visura triumphos

Sidere nunc meliore, leves appellimus oris,
Quid superesse putem?

To my honored Friend upon his Introduction.
IF they which find out clear and happy ways
To wealthy kingdoms, where the treasure pays
Their cost again,
Deserve to have their name
Shine, in the list of fame,
What honor then,
Shall we and time bestow
On him, to whom we owe,
For this near way to know?
Grammar which opens to the arts, had lost
Her golden key, this new one is thy cost;
Ages were spent,
And many Rocks our youth
Were forced to clime to truth,
Till this was lent.
For which great trust, since we
Are bad security,
The Arts are bound to thee.
Ia. Shirley.

Dear Sir, It is not my desire to show
Your Peerlesse worth, which all the world does know:
Nor (with those ^ond Astronomers who take
Great heights, with little instruments, and make
Unpardonable errors) to express
Deserts with unproportion'd feebleness:
It Is my ambition to be known your Friend,
"Worth clear to all, it is needless to commend.
John Fish.

Concordantia est triplex; Nominativi and Verbi: Substantivi and Adiectivi,
Relativi and Antecedentis.

Concordantia prima.
Nominativus and Verbum convenient numero and persona: vt, Probitas landatur
and alget. Suus cnique est mos.

Observatio.
Cum vnum verbum ad plures nominativos diversos repertum cum propiore numero
and persona convenit: vt, Hic illius arma, hic currus fuit. Aeneid. 1. Tu quid
ego, and populus mecum desideret, audi.

Cum digniore persona: vt,
Si tu and Tullia lux nostra valetis, ego and suavissimus Cicero valemus. 14.

Concordantia secunda.
Substantivum and Adiectivum convenient casu, genere, and numero: vt,
Corrumpunt bonos mores colloquia prava. Quandoque bonus dormitat Homerus.

Tam in hac quam in praecedenti regula reperitur nonnunquam anomalia and

Pater and matter mortui. Eun. Act. 3. Sc. 3.

Observatio secunda.
Substantivis rerum inanimatarum subijcitur saepe Adiectivum plurale neutrum:
ut Divitiae, decus and gloria in oculis sita sunt.

Concordantia tertia.
Relativum and Antecedens convenient genere, numero, and persona: ut, Literae
placuerunt, quas ad me dedisti. Qui leviter saeviunt, sapiunt magis.

Observatio prima.
Si Relativum and Antecedens eidem verbo adiungantur, etiam in casu convenient;
ut, Vrbem quam statuo, vestra est. 1. Aeneid.

Observatio secunda.
Relativum Qui, positum inter duo Antecendentia diversorum generum, nunc cum
priore, nunc cum posteriore convenit: ut, Vnus erat toto naturae vultus ^n
orb, Quem dixere Chaos. Animal plenum rationis, quem vocamus hominem.

Ob^ervatio tertia.
In Concordantia quic quid in vicem Nominativi, substantivi, vel Antecedentis

venit: vt, Divellimur inde Iphitus and Peiias mecum. Pars certare parati. Vbi
illic scelus est, qui me perdidit.

Observatio Quarta.
Interrogatio and responsio eodem fere ponuntur casu: Cui Praeceptori dedisti
operam? Platoni. Cuius est haec oration? Ci^eronis. Quo morbo fuisti impeditus?
assidua febricula.

Excipe quaestionem factam per Quanti; ut Quanti emptus est Liber? duobus
denarijs.

Et Cuius, cum ad hanc respondendum est per pronomen possessivum: ut, Cuius est
Liber? meus. Cuius puerum adduxisti? meum.

Et quando respondendum est per verbum variae Syntaxeos: ut Furtine accusas, an
Homicidij? vtroque.

De octo Partium orationis Constructione Lib. vnicus.
BEfore ought be commenced in the construction of a Noune and Verb, that is
to be noted in general, that Rection or Government of as many cases as the^^
are in Latin, is in three manners only; either it is a Genitive of
Possession, the which depends necessarily of a Noune substantive: I would
say, that as often as you shall find a Noune substantive in the genitive case,
it must of force be governed by some substantive which is either expressed or
understood.

The second, all Verbs that are, do govern their Accusative, and the
Accusative is governed by them.

The third, Prepositions govern their cases answerable to their Natures; The
first rule has two exceptions: for a Noune Adjective man govern a Genitive;
as Studiosus virtutis: but this is a Greek construction.

Likewise Adverbs may govern a genitive; as, satis temporis and then it is
said, that they take the place of a Noune. In such sort that setting ap^rt
these two exceptions, each genetiue is g^uern'd of a noune substantive; each
Accusative of a verb, each other case what soever, of his preposition; if the
case be capable of a preposition.

Secondly, it is to be observed that the Nominative, Dative, and Vocative are
never governed of any: as for the relation which is between the nominative and
the verb, it is not called Rection, but Concordance: the dative is always of
loss or profit, which we call a Dative of Acquisition* the Vocative is that
with which we speak, and to which we address our speech. This will we
examine by the following notes, in which the Reader shall be rationally
informed, of some things said, against that which has hitherto been in use:
which notes shall serve for a comment; for there is no reason, that all other
parts of the Art should be well po^sessed and yet there should remain a
deficiencie in the syntaxe, whereof there is m^st need. In the same notes,
there shall be inserted, the particular constructions of some verbes, which we
have cut off from the general Rules, because it has seemed expedient, to many
learned men, that the syntaxe should be brief, for that boys may have less
to commit to memory.

The Notes that shall succeed under each occurrent are principally for learned
men: for being to teach some things in the syntaxe against some received
opinions, it is meet I should distinctly render account of them.

The grounds of them shall be rendered as is aforesaid: for if it should be
taught according to the opinion of many learned men, that a superlatiue does
not make comparison, as hitherto has been said: and that Refert and Interest
have after them an accusative, and others in the same manner, it would be an
argument of imprudence, not to declare the reason and ground of those things,
and produce the Authors whom we follow. And because in this place a large
exposition cannot be composed, we desire that the Notes may serve for a brief
Comment.

De constructione Nominis substantivi.
DVo Substantiva continuata, si ad eandem rem pertinent, eodem casu gaudent:
ut, Vrbs Athenae.

Si autem ad diversas alterum cui sit possessionis nota erit Genetivus. Cic. In
Pison. Supplicium est poena peccati.

1. Note.
Be you advertised that the Genitive of Possession imports action, or
passion; as, Vulnus Achillis, he would say, the wound that Achilles gave to
another; or the wound that was inflicted on him Achilles. The same have you to
understand of the possessives, Meus, tuus, suus, noster, vester: Laurentius
Valla without foundation teaches the contrary. Cicero pro Marcel. Quis non
intelligat tua salute contineri suam: where salute tua, is that which Caesar
had; in such sort that tua is taken actiuely. Idem Cic. Philip. 10. An vero hoc
pro nihilo putas, in quo quidem pro amicitia tua iure dolere soleo? where
amicitia tua, is not what you have, but what is had to you, for you, and in
your behalf; and so said Budaeus in his Comment. Pro amicitia tua, id est, pro
amore quo tu diligeris. Answerable to Valla his doctrine, it should be rendered
pro amicitia tui. This which we profess, Budaeus, Muretus, and most amply
Franciscus Sanchez in his Minerva lib. 2. cap. 13. and others deliver.

Si vero Genitivus laudem, vel vituperaetionem significet, in Ablativum mutari
potest. Cic. 4. Fam. Neque te confirmare audeo maximi animi hominem, vel maximo
animo. Adiectiva cum substantive ponuntur, more substantivorum construuntur.
Cic. Tantum cibi, and potionis adhibendum est, etc.

De Constructione Nominis Adiectivi.
ADiectiva, quae scientiam, communionem, copiaem, and his contraria
significant, cum genitivo iunguntur: ut, juris peritus, consilii particeps,
plenus officij.

Item, quaedam in ax, ius, idus, and osus: ut, Philosophus tenax recti, nulliu^
culpae conscius, avidus virtutis, studiosus literarum. Quibus add memor,
Immemor, securus: ut, Memor beneficij* immemor injuriae, securus rumorum. Hi
casus reguntur ab adiectivis Graeco more.

Partitiva nomina, Numeralia, and quaecunque adiectiva partitionem significant,
genitivum possessionis, vel ablativum multitudinis cum praepositione, E, vel
Ex, vel de admittunt: ut, Nulla belluarum, unus militum multae arborum, vel ex
arboribus: unus militum, id est, unus ex numero militum: ex numero, inquam, nam
est partitio* Sic dicitur Animalium haec binis, illa quaternis pedibus incedunt.

2. Note.
The Grammar of this, is Vnus Militum, id est, unus ex numero Militum. And ^o
this genitive is of possession, for it is governed by the substantive Numero;
which is to be understood necessarily, for the being Partitives is nothing
else, then for one particular, to be parted, and divided from the common number.

Superlativa.
Superlativum Nomen est, quod dissolvitur in Positivum, and Adverbium valde,
aut maxim: ut, doctissimus, valde doctus, aut maxim doctus. Iungiturque cum
genitivo plurali possessionis, vel singulari, qui multitudinem significet. Cic.
5. Tus. Theophrastus elegantissimus omnium. idem ^ro Rab. Plato totius Graeciae
doctissimus. Est autem doctissimus omnium, idem, quod, doctissimus ex numero
omnium. Hic genitivus in ablativum cum praepositione E, vel Ex, vel De mutari
potest. Cic. pro Cluen. Ex his omnibus natu minimus. Inter dum in accusativum
cum praepositione, Inter. Senec. 2. Contro. Croesus inter reges opulentissimus.

3. Note.
Very learned men aver, that the genitive of the superlative is by way of
comparison: others instance that there is no comparison in the superlative, but
partitio^ only; which no body denies: the difference is the first will that
there be comparison, and partition; the second, that there be partition only;
And that there is not in the superlative any comparison, it appears evident,
it being that comparison has his force in these two particles, magis quam,
more then: and the superlative admits not these, for the same resolved, is,
Doctissimus, quasi valde, or Maxim doctus, id est, most learned, or very
learned. In such sort that this speech, Cicero is the more learned of the
Romans, is not to be thus rendered, Cicero doctissimus omnium Romanorum, but is
to be delivered by comparative, as hereafter shall be seen: for the word does
not comprehend in it a superlative; so as, Doctissimus omnium, shall import the
same, that Doctissimus ex numero omnium, most, or very learned of the number of
all. And the Castilian language must maintain these said of necessity, for all
acknowledge, that every superlative, is partitive: and is to be declared as
partitive, so as the genitive shall be of possession. You will say that a
superlative includes always excess, which cannot be without comparison. I
say that it always contains excess, yet not comparative excess, which
consists in this particle, More, for from hence would it follow, that Magnus,
which is a positive, might bear comparison.

Moreover that the superlative includes excess without comparison is manifest
by the Hebrew and Chaldaie circumlocutions, Genesis 1. (...) Chal. (...) valde
bonum, id est, optimum. As who would say, exceeding good, or good beyond
comparison. For so some Jewish expositors explicate the place.

Secondly, you will instance that these manner of speeches are in the Latin
tongue very ordinary, Prudens, prudentior, prudentissimus; from whence it
appears, that there is a comparative ascent received. I answer, that the
Spanish is, to run, Prudente, mas prudente, prudentissimo, or muy prudente, and
that it is a mere deceitful folly to say muy mas prudente, for that the
superlative imports an excess, beyond all comparison (so likewise in our
English tongue is it found Prudent, more prudent, and most prudent: which
though it express not the superlative, in one single word, yet most so added,
add excess without all comparison) by what we have produced: for really if I
were to make comparison, were it an hundred times, I should be constrained to
repeat the word Prudentior, as Horace has done, saying, Aetas maiorum peior
avis, tulit Nos nequiores mox daturos Progeniem vitiosiorem, where as least
according to the Grammarians Rules, he should have put a superlative in the
last. Yet be it observed, that whenever there shall be annexed any
preposition, including any excellency, then shall it have comparison, as,
Doctissimus ant^ omnes, supra omnes, prae omnibus, more learned then all the
rest.

Which comparison takes his force from the preposition, as in the like case it
does in Greek; Lucian de Galatea, (...), Ego ex omnibus pulcherrima visa sum:
nor for this may it be said to compare, for the positive has the same, as,
Formosus prae omnibus, more fair then all besides. The prepositions e, ex, de,
inter, do not import excellency, and even so say we, Doctissimus omnium, is
the same that is ex omnibus and inter omnes.

Genitivus vel Dativus post Nomen.
Nomina quae similitudinem aut dissimilitudinem significant item Communis,
Proprius, interrogandi, vel dandi casui haerent, Teren. Eunu. Domini similis,
vel Domino. Cic. de Senect. Proprium senectutis vitium. Commune valetudinis,
vel valetudini.

4. Note.
This construction, in that which concerns the Genitive is Greek, and the
Dative is of acquisition, which is to be noted in all these like Nounes.

Dativus post Nomen.
Nomina quibus commodum, voluptas, graetia, favor, aequalitas, fidelitas, and
his contraria significantur, iunguntur eleganter Dativo acquisitionis: ut,
Consul salutaris, perniciosus Reipublicae. Iucundus, molestus, gratus, invisus,
propitius, infestus civibus, fidus, infidus imperio: par, impar tanto oneri.
Item verbalia in bilis: ut, Amabilis omnibus, and quaedam nomina, quae ex
particula con, componuntur: ut, conscius mihi, consentaneus omnibus. Denique,
quaecunque Adiectiva habent hunc Dativum acquisitionis. Pleraque autem
eleganter efferuntur interdum cum accusativo, et praepositione ad: ut,
accommodatus, appositus, aptus, habilis, Idoneus, utilis, natus huic rei, vel
ad hanc rem.

Accusativus post nomen.
Adiectiva quae vel patriam, vel gentem, vel habitum, vel parte^ in homine
significant, et a Grammaticis per praepositionem, secundum, exponuntur; apud
Poetas saepius, in prosa oratione rarius, accusativum adsciscunt. Vir. 4.
Aeneid.

Omnia Mercurio similis vocemque coloremque, Et flavos crines, etc.

Tradunt in Misia feram esse quae Bon^sus vocatur, equina iuba, caetera tauro
similem. Pl. l. 3.

Ablativus post Nomen* Comparativa.
Comparativum nomen est, quod unum vel plura quocunque modo superans
dissolvitur in positivum, and adverbium magis: ut, Doctior, magis doctus;
iungiturque cum ablativo, Cic. 1. Cati. Luce sunt clariora nobis tua consilia.
Plin. lib. 36. cap. 9. de quadam navi. Omnibus, quae in mari visae sunt
mirabiliorem. Est autem doctior omnibus, idem quod doctior prae omnibus. Quod
apud Hebraeos magis patet, exprimunt enim comparativum per particulam (...),
ex, five prae, ut Cant. 1. Boni amores tui (...) prae vino. Eodem modo caeterae
linguae orientales cum Graeca lingua circumscribunt comparativum.

5. Note.
Hitherto it has been a wont to exclude comparatives, and this was held for
false Latin, Cicero est doctior omnibus Romany: saying that it should have
been expressed by the superlative; yet so many authorities are there, which
teach the contrary, that we were compelled to deliver the Rule as it is now.
Plin. lib. 36. cap. 9. making mention of a ship, uses these words: Omnibus
quae in mari visae sunt mirabiliorem. Valerius Max. speaking of three
Dionisio's. Tertium te importuniorem habere caepimus. Ovid. 13. Metamorph.
Omnibus inferior quas sustinet arduus ether; and 2. Praestantior omnibus
Hearse. Plaut. capti. Non ego nunc Parasitus sum, sed Regum rex regalior.
Martial. lib. 11. Hic totus volo rideat libellus and sit nequior omnibus
Libellis. Ovid treating of the five Zones. Quinta est ardenuor illis. Plin.
lib. 36. cap. 7. writing of the Marmoles. Viride cunctis hilarious. Thus the
Greek often use the Comparative, as it were, instead of the Superlative.
(...). Omnibus difficilius est praeesse animabus for difficillimum, Nilus. In
confirmation of this, there might be brought in, many more testimonies: so as
well shall this speech be delivered. Virgilius poetis omnibus politior est.
Latinis excellentior, Graecis praestantior, Homero divinior, caeteris, cunctis,
reliquis suavior. But mark well, that the Ablative of the Comparative is ruled
by the Praeposition, Prae, which is understood, and so the Grammar is Doctior
omnibus, id est, doctior prae omnibus: which Preposition, many clearly
expressed. Apulei. lib. 8. Prae ceterie feris mitior cerva. Ibid. Vnus prae
ceteris fortior. Moreover and above, that this Doctrine is of the learned
Sosipater, Charifius, lib. 1. does clearly likewise teach it; and brings
examples, wherewith he does ratify it. And to make this Rule more general,
it is to be understood, that how many soever they are, by virtue of a
Preposition, one while it is joined to Verbes, sometimes to Nounes, Positives,
Comparatives, or Superlatives. Plaut. Mostel. Nihil pendere omnes prae
Philolache. Cic. Sulpitio. Prae nobis, beatus vir. O foelix una ante alias
Priameia virgo. Idem, Scelere ante alios immanior omnes. Sucton. Galba. Crucem
statui iussit praeter caetera altiorem. We have spoken of the Superlative
already, in his proper place. In such sort, that of two particles, that it has
which makes comparison, viz. Magis quam, more then, the Comparative has in
himself the first place, for Doctior is the same, that is Magis doctus, and
the rest it receives of a Preposition.

Pleraque Adiectiva iunguntur Ablativo quae significent Laudem, Vituperationem,
vel Partem. Q. Cic. de petit. Consul. Nequaquam sunt tam genere insignes, quam
vitijs nobiles. Sal, de Bell. Catil. Antonius pedibus aeger.

6 Note.
This Ablative is governed of the Preposition In, or of some other which may be
commodiously understood: which the Latins have forsaken, for elegancy sake;
the reason of this is, that oftentimes they applied a Preposition to the same
things.

Opus nomen substantivum eleganter Ablativo, vel Nominativo adiungitur: ut,
Opus est mihi libro, opus est mihi liber. Mi obra, y negocio es ellibro.

7 Note.
Hitherto it has been taught that opus was a Noune Adjective, although it
cannot be other then a Substantive, which is manifest, because sometimes it is
found with an Adjective. Horat. sunt quibus vnum opus est, intactae Palladis
vrbem, Carmine perpetuo celebrar^: this proposition, Opus est mihi Liber, is
the same, that, Totum meum opus est liber, all my business and entertainment,
is a Book: the Greeks say (...) Opus est mihi Libro, id est, Totum opus meum
est in libro positum: So do learned men of the University of Salamanca
expound these speeches. In such sort, that Opus est mihi liber, does not
import, I have need of a book, but my business and entertainment, and my
work, is a book, as is seen in other like expressions. For as it is said,
Opus est mihi liber, so likewise is spoken, Cura est mihi liber, a book is my
care; Senectus mihi est morbus; Pater mihi est taedium, imagine that you say,
Liber est opus meum: All my business is a book; the same likewise will it be,
meum, being left out. Sextum Nudus amat. Dignus, Contentus, Inanis
Atque Refertus, item Locuples, Alienus, Onustus.
Immunis, Plenus, Casus, Diuesque, Potensque.
Tum Fretus, Vacuus, tum captus, Praeditus, Orbus.
Praeterea Extorris, quibus omnibus addito Liber.


Cic. Atti. Huic tradita est vrbs nuda praesidio, referta copijs. Horum
pleraque iunguntur etiam Genitivo, Graeco more: ut, dignus honoris. So say
they, Hom. Il. (...) (...) Vnus vir medicus dignus multorum aliorum. So
Chrysostom, (...). Nihil dignum amici fidelis. Ablativus horum nominum pendet
a varijs praepositionibus.

Alienus interdum cum dativo reperitur, ut pro Cec. ^d dicit quod illi causae
maxim est alienum. Vbi alienum est dativus acquisitionis incommodum
significans.

8 Note.
The Ablative of these nounes depends ever more of a Preposition, for many
Authors have attributed it to them, and even it will be necessary sometimes to
express the preposition, to avoid Amphibology: as liber servitute, may have
two meanings, id est, liber a servitute, vel liber in ipsa adhuc servitute; so
in the same manner, vacuus, vel ab ipsa cura, vel in cura ipsa, and so others.

Adiectiva diversitatis, and Numeralia Ordinis Ablativum cum Praepositione A
vel Ab. admittunt, Cic. 4. Acad. certa cum illo, qui a te totus diversus est.

Item securus. Liber; vacuus. Purus, Nudus. Inops. Extorris. Cic. pro Dom. Tam

De constructione verbi.
Omne verbum Personale, seu finitum, utrinque Nominativum habere potest, cum
utrumque nomen ad eandem rem pertinet, maxim verbum substantivum, ut suo loco
dicetur, and vocativum. Cic. de Orat. Qui habentur, and vocantur sapientes.

De Constructione verbi cognatae significationis, vulgo neutri.
Note that the intension is according to Syntax, which is handled, not
Etymology.

BEfore entrance be made in the Verb, which is ordinarily styled a Neuter, be
advertised, that there be many learned me^, who with great reason think that
there are no such verbes, rather that all they so called, are Actives: the
ground is, for that Verbes are in two kinds: the one, whose action passes not
further then to an accusative, denominated Cognatae significationis, which is
the same as if one should say, passes not further then to an accusative, which
declares the action contained in the same verb, for further clearness not
expressed, but when he would have some thing more added: as vivo requires this
accusative vitam, and it needs not to be added for clearness, and if it had
been set down, it would have been a speech of Pleonasmus, and Redundance
without necessity; yet if I would express ought besides that which is
signified by this acculative vitam, I must deliver it thus; Vivo vitam
perdifficilem. And so Cicero had no cause why he should h^ve said, Gaudere
gaudium, because it was in it self clear; yet when he would add more, he
expressed himself thus, Vt suum gaudium gauderemus; and Virgil: Furere hunc
furorem. And likewise many others, as Cicero, Curro arduum cursum. Consimilem
luserat ludum: dormit somnum Endymionis; Navigat navigationem asperam: The same
have the verbes which all the world acknowledge to be Actives, Verbi gratia
lego, iudico. With which it suffices to say, Legit Magister, Iudex indicat,
for now is understood Lectionem, Iudicium, and surely as you will not profess,
that this speech Legit Magister, is of a verb Neuter, as little have you to
aver of this. Nauta navigat.

And although some of these under the Active termination, have a passive
signification, yet may they rightly be styled Actives, as in other languages
in the same case they are. For Xenoph. speaks thus: (...): Ille a vobis
interfectus est vir bonus cum esset. So in Hebrew in Active coniugations, the
signification is plainly neuter and intransitive, as (...) in Piel festinavit
(...) in Hiphil surrexit. So in the Chald. and Syriaque (...) pervenit, in
Pael. (...) in Aphel regnavit. So in Arabique in the first conjugation merely
active, (...) contristatus est, in a passive and intransitive signification.

The other sort is of Verbes, which clearly all men call Actives, to which is
added an accusative, because of incertaintie, as, Amo filium: Libros:
Haereditatem: And if you shall answer, that to have one only action, is not
sufficient that they be called Actives: this answer satisfies not the learned,
for one action is enough to prove a verb to be active, without that very many
of them have more then one action: of which we will lay before your view a
brief Catalogue, in the succeeding ninth Note, which has reference to this
Note. Finally, when an appropriate accusative was not found for these verbes,
in lieu of action they applied their own Infinitive: and therein, were many
ancient forms, of speaking, grounded. Plautus, Pseudo. Pergitis pergere. Cic.
in Arato. Post hunc ore fero Capricornus vadere pergit. Livi. lib. 22. Pergit
deinde ire sequentibus paucis: and so were many others, as Iaceo jacere, perit
perire, etc. which is the construction of the Greeks, who use much this kind
of action.

The Hebrew tongue and Chald. use the like manner of speaking, Genesis 2. (...),
Chapter (...) mori morieris, cap. 3. (...), Non mori moriemini.

Finally, the Grammarians themselves, and Authors of Arts acknowledge, that all
Verbes have no more, then action and passion: which you shall survay in the
underwritten note, which I take out of the seventh Note of the third Book of
my Author; and whilst they profess so much, yet make they so many divisions
of verbes; not agreeing with their own proper doctrine.

In conclusion, be it known, that these verbes besides the accusative of their
proper action tacit, or expressed, many have other common cases which are
Genitives of possession, Dative of acquisition, Ablative which depends of a
preposition: which cases, although they may be annexed to many verbes, yet
with particular elegancie they are joined to those which are placed in the
three following orders.

Verbs Deponents are so called, not for the reason delivered by some
Grammarians, but for that anciently, there were many verbes in Or, which were
common, ^ignifying action and passion, and this in imitation of the verb
called medium of the Greeks: yet now by custom they have forsaken their
passive signification, abiding only with the active, insomuch as it is all
one, to name verbs deponents, as to say verbes actives deponents. For Amplector
virtutem, is action, and so these verbes are actives. And those of these
deponents which are styled Neuters, are also Actives, and that there are no
more verbes then actives and passives, the Grammarians themselves deliver,
Priscian lib. 8. Verbum est pars orationis cum temporibus, sine casu, agendi,
vel patiendi significativum. Ha dissinitione omnia tam finita quam infinita
verba comprehenduntur, and neutra etiam quae dicuntur absoluta; and Deponentia
omnino naturali^er, vel in actu sunt, vel in passione. Antoninus de Nebrixa,
lib. 3. professes the same. Verbum est pars orationis declinabilis cum modis
and temporibus agendi, vel patiendi significativa. Scaliger says, Quibus
manifestum est verba Neutra non esse ab activis seiuncta. Besides this all good
Philosophers do deliver, that in all actions there is Agere, vel Pati; for
that these verbs which are called Neuters, have place in humane actions, which
is all one, as if you should aver, that they neither have action nor Passion:
and less have the deponents, unless it be so far forth as they are Actives.

9 Note.
Besides, an Accusative, which Verbs improperly called Neuters, have of their
own Action, as Vivo vitam, curro cursum, etc. Many others have Accusatives,
though Neuters called: first it shall not be needful to bring examples of
eleven several Verbs which are wont to be numbered in the neutrall order, since
that all Grammarians confess that they have an Accusative. These are Antecedo,
Anteeo, Antesto, Anteverto, Attendo, Praesto, Praecurro, Praeeo. Praestolor,
Incessit, Illudo. And in truth, as these are, all the rest are, and I know not
why they did not reckon the rest together with these eleven, since they have
likewise an Accusative. Let us then draw up a Catalogue of these Verbs, giving
them Accusatives, from the authority of very approved Authors.

So many examples we have brought in, to the end that we might banish the abuse
of these Verbes Neuters. This Note belongs of due unto the great diligence of
Francis Sanchez, the collector of them, and many more examples, in the third
book of his Minerva: And although in that his book, there has been taken
great pains, yet it has seemed expedient to compile this note. For we
understand that this Art will draw together more hands besides these of
Minerva. We have left other many examples and Verbes, for hardly is there any
verb of these, in which is found no action: and it is not necessary that a
Verb to be active, should have all the accusatives, that are, those that every
one confesses to be actives, have them in as little measure; for to say, Agere
ve^ba, would be Barbarism, to say Accuso parietem furti, would be
innecessarie: and an infinite of others of the same sort. and answerable to
what has been said, it is not needful that a verb active have as many
accusatives, and actions as there are in the world.

The reason of this construction is very probably the active and transitiue
signification of these verbes. For so we find in like manner in other tongues,
that verbes absolute and intransitive govern an accusative. For the Greeks
sa^, (...) privor bona, for bonis. So the Syriaque, Ioh. 7. uses the passive
participle, (...) in the active signification, and joins it with an
accusative. The reason of this is, that the signification becomes transitive.
So where it is said, Coelos splendido coruscat astro, id est, facit coelos
coruscare. In the Greek, the preposition (...) is understood. In the Syriaque
is the like subintellection, which in Heb. 1. Sam. 12. is expressed.

De Genitivo.
Interest, and Refert Genitivo possessionis iunguntur, Cic. 1. Fini, Interest
R^gis recte facere, id est, recte facere est inter officia Regis.

Item his Accusativis, Mea, Tua, Sua, Nostra, Vestra; Teren. Hecy: Tua quod
nihil refert, percontari desinas, Mea* interest id* est, est inter mea,
videlicet, officia, aut munerae.

Item his Genitivis, Magni, Parvi, Tanti, Quanti. Cice. 6. Tir. Magni ad
honorem nostrum interest, me ad urbem venire; Caetera huiusmodi per Adverbium
adduntur. Cice. Theodori nihil interest. Cuia, v^l cuius interest pereleganter
dicitur.

Verbum interest loco genitivi potest accusativum cum praepositione recipere.
Cic. Et quidem ad laudem nostram non multum video interesse.

Verbum est impersonale pro licet, fieri potest, vel fas est quandoque
accipitur, and tunc infinitivum asciscit. Virg. Aeneid. 6.

Nec non and Tityon terr^ omnipotentis alumnu^ Cernere erat* id est, licebat.
Plin.

Nocturnorum animalium veluti felium in tenebris fulgent radiantque oculi, ut
contueri non fit.

10. Note.
These words, Mea, tua, sua, etc. according to some, are Ablatives of the
singular number, and that the meaning is, Mea interest, id est, mea re
interest, mea re refert. But if this be as is delivered, we might likewise
say, Meo interest, id est, meo negotio interest. Caelius Calcagninus, lib. 1.
Epist. Julius Scaliger de causis: and Franciscus Sanchez in his Minerva, avouch
with great confidence, that these words are accusatives, of the plural number,
and neuter termination: and that the sense is Mea interest, est inter mea
negoria, aut officia, aut munera. And indeed the Greeks often express a
preposition after the verb Est impersonall, as Nazi. (...) Non est ad virum
bonum, id est, non est viri boni. For that the Ancients with more facility
supply words of the neuter gender then any other. In the same manner, Mea
refert, is, Refert mea negotia, munera, aut officia, id est, Repraesentat, as
Ego refero patrem, id est Repraesento. For that these being Accusatives, as
these Authors determine, there cannot be other meaning, then what is delivered.
In the same manner, Donat. Phorm. Terent. upon those words, Quid tua, malum, id
refert, professes clearly, that these are accusatives: and adds, that they
are governed of a preposition which is to be understood, not unlike said
Horace, 1. Ser. villa. -- Quae superest Claudi cau pona, id est, quae est super
Claudi caupona. The sense of this preposition: Regis interest, aut ref^rt, is
this: Est inter officia Regis: Refert, id est, Repraesentat officia Regis: and
so the Genitive is of possession. Satago etiam Genetivo adiungitur. Terent.
Heaut. Clinia rerum suarum satagit.

11. Note.
This Genitive is governed of the Adverbe sat, or satis, of which the verb is
compounded, and so the meaning will be, Ago aut agito satis mearum rerum.
Plaut. Bacchid. treating of those things of fate; Nunc agitas tute sat tuarum
rerum.

Other verbes there are, to whom there is not only annexed a genitive, but
other cases, and so as verbes of exception we place in the 12. Note.

12. Note.
Misereor is joined sometime with a genit^ve. Cic. Qui miserere mei: another
time with a dative. Senec. Controv. Misereor tibi puellae. The genitive is
ruled of the accusative vicem, which is understood: Misereor tui, id est, vicem
tui. The Dative is of acquisition. Obliviscor, Recordor, Reminiscor, are joined
sometimes to a Genitive, some times to an accusative. Cic. 3. Tuscul. Ob
livisci suorum, vel sua, to which is added, Memini, when it does signify the
same that does Recordor. Cic. de Senect. Omnia quae curant senes meminerunt,
vel omnium. The same Memini when it signifies Mentionem facio, sometimes is
joined to a Genitive, sometime to an Ablative with the Preposition De. Quintil.
lib. 11. cap. 2. Neque omnino huius rei meminit usquam Poeta: vel de hac re.

De Dativo.
Verba, quae auxilium, adulationem, commodum, incommodum, favorem, studium
significant, iunguntur Dativo Acquisitionis: (praeter Iuvo and Laedo quae
accusativo gaudent) ut, Auxilior* Adulor, commedo, incommodo, faveo tibi,
studeo Philosophiae*

Vide 29. Note.

Dativo item adhaerent composita ex verbo sum: and quae obsequium, obe
dientiam, submissionem, Repugnantiam significant: ut, Prosum, obsequor,
obtempero, servio, repugno tibi.

Item quae eventum significant. Cic. i. offi. Quod cuique obtigi^, id quisque
teneat. Teren. Facite, quod vobis libet. Praeter Attinet, Pertinet, Spectat ad
me.

Multa denique composita, ex verbis cognatae significationis, and
praepositionibus Ad, Con. In. Inter. Ob. Prae. Sub ut, Assurgo, consentio,
Immineo, illacbrymor, intervenio, obversor, praeluceo, succumbo oneri.

In the ensuing 13. Note, we do put the Verb Incumbo, Consulo, Interdico,
because ^hey are particulars. Concerning those Verbs which others use to
dispose in this place which sometimes have a Dative, sometimes an Accusative,
as Praesto tibi, vel te, we treat of in the 9. Note in the beginning.

13 Note.
Incumbo, when it does refer it self to things importing Addiction of the
mind, as study, it is joined with the Preposition In or Ad, Cic. lib. 10. Fam.
Mi Plance, incumbe toto pectore ad laudem. Consulote. I ask counsel of you:
Consulo tibi, I give counsel to you, id est, Consulo tibi utile, vel commod^m.
Interdico, has an Accusative, and a Dative of Acquisition. Sueton. Domit.
Interdixit histrionibus Scoenam. Liui. 34 Foeminis duntax at vsum purpurae
interdicamus. Likewise it has a Dative, and an A^lative. Coesar. Gall.
Ariovistus. omni Gallia Romany interdixit: where the Dative is of Acquisition,
and the Ablative is governed of the Praeposition, id est, ab omni Gallia: for
that Plin. lib. 39. cap. 1. said, Interdixit tibi de Medicis, and ^ice. pro
Caecin. Praetor interdixit de vi hominibus armatis.

De Ablativo.
Sextum vult egeo, indigeo, Vaco, victito.
Vescor. Vivo, supersedeo, Potior, Delector, Abundo.
Mano, redundo, fluo, scateo, fruor, atque laboro.
Glorior, Oblector, Laetor, quibus addito nitor.
Consto, pluit, valeo, possum, Sto, Fungor, and utor.
Cum Careo, Fido, Confido, Periclitor add.
Cic. ad Q. Fr. Incredibile est, mi, frater, quam egeam tempore. In his omnibus
Ablativus pendet a Praepositione.

This Verb utor signifying the same that utilitatem capere, according to
Stephanus, or usum habere, may have the Preposition Ex or Cum, very well
understood, which in other Languages is expressed, as Psalm. 51. verse 1. (...)
the Chalde Paraphrase explaineth it thus, (...) postquam usus est, cum
Bathsheba, id est postquam usum habuit.

Eruor, according to Donatus in Eunuch. Ter* being the same that a frumine
vesci, and servius, expressing that of Virgil 7. Aeneid. Frui colloquio
deorumi, pasci, may very well have the Preposition ( a) understood, as the
Jewish Rabbines say. (...) Fructus est ab hoc, id est, utilitatem cepit. Fungor
is expressed by the Greek, (...) id est, finio, so that fungi officio may have
the Preposition In understood, and import as much as Finio in officio. The like
or more plainly of the rest.

14 Note.
Egeo, Indigeo, Potior, are also joined to a Genitive, Cic. 6. Phil. hoc bellum
indiget celeritatis. Potior, Vescor* Fungor, Pluit are found oftentimes with an
Accusative. Teren. Adelph. Ille sine labor, patria potitur commoda. Neuters
oftentimes admit an Ablative, which signifies part Cic 2. de Orat. In
principijs dicendi tota mente, at que omnibus artubus contremisco. All the
Ablatives of this third rank, depend on diverse Prepositions, howbeit as use
has abandoned them altogether, with difficulty may they be found out, yet this
is proved, for that many of this kind are joined with a Preposition, Cic. 1.
not. Deo. Homo qui ex animo constat and corpore. Idem de offic. Iudiciorum
ratio, ex accusatione, and defensione constat. Idem 3. de Fin. Gloriari de
vita. Idem pro Mil. Cuius in vita nitebatur salus civitatis. Apulcius, Fons ex
aqua redundans, So it is said, Laetari de aliqua re, etc. Mark that there are
many other Verbes put in this rank, which we pass, that for they are
altogether common cases, which appertain to Instrument, Manner, or Action:

De constructione Verbi substantivi.
Sum utrinque Nominativum Substantivum habet: ut, Senectus ipsa est morbus.
Virgilius est Mantuanus, id est, civis, vel vir; Adolescentis est maiores natu
vereri, id est, Maiores natu vereri est officium adolescentis.

Cum hoc verbo iocum non habent illi Genitivi mei, tui, sui, nostri, vestri:
pro quibus utimur. Meum, tuum, suum, nostrum, vestrum: ut, nostrum est senes
vereri; id est, senes vereri est nostrum officium.

15 Note.
The rest of this Verb we do reduce to the Notes, for being a common
construction, when it signifies to be esteemed, it is joined with the
Genitives, Magni, Maximi, and with those of price and estimation, Cic. lib. 15.
Fam. Magni crunt tuae literae. So likewise is annexed to it a Dative, of
Acquisition, as sum pater tibi natura, and consilijs: and then they use to
express it by the Verb habeo, as Habes me patrem natura, and consilijs. Or by
two Datives, as, mihi hoc est molestiae, which is the same with A^sicior
molestia. It is associated also with a Genitive or an Ablative, of Praise or
Dispraise, Plin. lib. 4. Epist. Erat puer acris Ingenij, vel acri ingenio.

De constructione Verbi Activi.
Verbum activum, vel potius Accusativum, cuiuscunque id demum positionis sit,
post se Accusandi casum postulat; ut, Deum cole, imitare Divos. Novi animi tui
moderationem, non decet ingenuum pueru^ scurrilis iocus. Vivo vitam
perdissicilem.

Every Verb Active does govern only an Accusative, and whatsoever other case
is joined thereunto, is a common case, and there may be added four. A Genitive
of Possession, Dative of Acquisition, Accusative according as it is governed by
some Preposition, and an Ablative which is likewise ruled by a Preposition. Of
all these, reason is, and shall be given.

De Genitivo praeter Accusativum.
Verba accusandi, absolvendi, damnandi, praeter Accusativum admittunt Genitivum
Possessionis, qui poenam crimenve significet. Cic. p. Rab. An non intelligis
quales viros summi sceleris arguas. Teren. Eu. Hic furti se alligat, id est,
furti crimine.

Genitivus, qui crimen significet, in Ablativum cum praepositione, De, mutari
potest, maxim cum his verbis Accuso, Arguo, Appello, Absolvo, Damno, Condemno,
Defero, Postulo, Livi. 6. bell. Pun. Blactius de proditione Dasium appellabat.

Hoc nomen Crimen Ablativo sine Pr^positione eleganter effertur, a qua tamen
pendet. Cic. 2. Fam. Ego te eodem crimine conde^nabo.

Dicimus eleganter, capite aliquem Damnare, Punire, Plectere.

Absolvo etiam, Libero, Alligo, Astringo, Obstringo, Mulcto, Obligo, Ablativum
significantem poenam, crimenue tacita praepositione admittunt. Liu. lib. 1. Ego
me etsi peccato absolvo, supplicio non libero.

Miseret, Miserescit, Piget, Poenitet, Pudet, Taedet, Genetivo praeter
accusativum efferuntur, sic, Miseret me tui, id est, misericordia tenet me tui.
Eodem modo Pigritia, Poenitentia, Pudor, Taedium.

16 Note.
The Genitive of these Verbes, is governed of the Ablative Crimine, which is
understood, and the reason is, because many times the Authors clearly dispose
it so, Martial. lib. 11. Arguimur lentae crimine pigritiae. Val. Max. lib. 4.
cap. 2. Incesti crimine a Tribus Lentulis accusatus, and lib. 6. cap. 1.
Crimine impudicitiae damnatus est. From hence is conceived the reason of two
things. The first that disposing of all Nounes which import Crimen in the
Genitive, the same name Crimen alone is put in the Ablative, for all the rest
are ruled by it, and all of them are genitives of possession. The, second that
this speech shall be approved in Latin: Accusasne illum superbiae? an
avaritiae? an altero tantum? an utroque? an ambobus? for that Crimine, or
Criminibus is understood. That which we say of the verb Miserescit* and the
rest; that it is the same, Pudet me tui, that is, Pudor me habet tui, is the
opinion of Priscian.

Verba pretij and Aestimationis.
Verba Pretij, atque Aestimationis praeter Accusativum hos fere Genitivos
possessionis assumunt, Magni, Maximi, Pluris, Plurimi Parvi, Minoris, Minimi,
Tanti, Tantidem, Quanti, Quanticunque. In his Grammatica est: Emo, aut Aestimo
pallium tanti, id est: Emo, aut Aestimo pallium pretio tanti aeris.

Dicimus etiam Magno, Permagno, Parvo, Nonnihilo, and magno pretio aestimare.
Vale: Max. lib. 5. Magno ubique pretio virtus aestimatur. Parvo aestimatur, id
est, parvo pretio Sic etiam tanto, quanto, quantocunque, Minore pretio. Livi.
2. Bell. Pun. Non minore pretio redimi possumus.

Nauci, Flocci, Pili, Assis, Teruntij, Nihili, iunguntur eleganter cum verbo
facio, sed and cum multis alijs; ut, Flocci te facio, aut aestimo, id est,
pretio flocci.

17. Note.
All these Genitives are of possession, for they are governed of the Ablative
of price or estimation not expressed; which Horace 1. Sermon* expressly sets
down; Nonnunquam pretio pluris licuisse licebit. And it is a pregnant
argument, that Authors do oftentimes add with these Genitives an Adiective,
in an Ablative case; which necessarily must agree with the Ablative of price,
there understood. And so said Plaut. Epid. 1. Quanti emi potest? minimo, id
est, pretio minimo. And Cic. ad Attic. Id prope dimidio minoris constabit, id
est, dimidio pretio minoris. It being declared how they govern these
genitives, it is necessary to know with whom these that are adiectives
concord. Let it be noted that this genitive Aeris, must be supplied, and so
Aestimo to magni will import, Aestimo te pretio magni aeris, although for
elegancie the Latins have forsaken pretio, and aeris. Columel. delivered them
clearly* lib. 3. cap. 3. Quem vulgus parvi aeris posse comparari putat. The
reason why this Genitive is supplied, is because a noune adiective, as we have
avouched in the third book, cannot stand alone by himself, and when it is
alone some substantive is to be understood, on whom it relyeth. And that rather
the genitive aeris, then any other is to be understood, is because as Authors
affirm, Apud veteres omnia pecunia aestimabantur. Supposed that these are
common cases, these speeches shall be said; Amo te tanti; Doceo pluris; lego
minoris, Maximi iter facio, etc. And it is collected from the same Authors of
Arts, who hitherto have been, that these are common cases: for they deliver
this Rule: Quaelibet verba Ablativum admittunt significantem pretium, vel hos
Genitivos tanti, tantidem, quanti, quanticumque, pluris, minoris, and they
extract more then these Genitives. Then I demand when Cicero said 3. Offic.
Emit tanti, could not he have pronounced, Emit magni? Finally mark that in
place of pretio, there may be substituted Ablatives of other things, like unto
those of price, as, Emi hoc quinque talentis, quatuor drachmis, duabus minis,
aere, argento, auro, etc.

Note also that these genitives, tanti, quanti, etc. after verbes of estimation
may be said to be used in imitation of the Greeks, who use the like after
verbes of estimation and permutation, as, (...) Aurea aeneis permutare,
Demosth. (...), Aestimo hoc plurimi.

De Dativo praeter Accusativum.
Verba omnia Dativum habent acquisitionis, ut, Amo haereditatem filio meo,
explico lectionem discipulis. Sed imprimis hunc sibi eleganter adiungunt verba
Dandi, Reddendi, Committendi* Promittendi, Declarandi, Ant^ ponendi,
postponendi. Teren. And. Facile omnes, cum valemus* recta consilia, aegrotis
damus. Sic, Facio tibi fidem. Miner, minitor tibi mortem.

Multa denique composita ex praepositionibus, Ad, in, ob, prae, sub; ut, Adimo,
impono, obijcio, praeficio, subtraho tibi materiam.

Sunt etiam, quibus geminus Dativus, and uterque acquisitionis, praeter
accusativum eleganter apponitur* ut, Do tibi hoc laudi; Vitio, Culpae, crimini,
pignori, faenori: vertis id mihi stultitiae. Ducis honori, damn^.

18. Note. Vide 29.
The Dative is of acquisition, and it is even common to as many verbes, as
there are, yet with particular elegancie, the Authors have placed it with them,
which are in this rank.

De altero Accusativo praeter primum Accusativum.
Moneo, doceo cum compositis: item Flagito, posco, reposco, rogo, interrogo,
celo, praeter primum accusativum sibi alterum adiungunt qui pendet a
praepositione. Cicer. 1. Fin. Sapientia nos omnes docet vias, id est, docet nos
iuxta omnes vias.

Vtraque ratione similem habent constructionem Graeci Aeschin in Ctesiphont.
(...), Decet rogare deos bona, and alteri accusativo expressa praepositione, ut
vulgo dicitur, (...), petere ab aliquo bona.

Vide 19, 20. and 21. Notes.

19. Note.
Adm^neo, commoneo, commonefacio, are annexed also to a genitive after an
accusative, Quintil. libr. 4. Grammaticos sui officij commonemus.

20. Note.
Likewise is observed this particular elegancy, Moneo, admoneo, commoneo,
doceo, edoceo, erudio te de haec re, id est, commonefacio, certiorem facio.
Likewise these, Interrogo, and celo, Cic. Partitio, Ego te ijsdem de rebus
interrogem? Idem Bassus noster me de hoc libro celavit, vel mihi celatus est
liber.

21. Note.
Many learned men say, and with much assurance, that the second accusative of
verbes of this order, is ruled of some preposition, which is understood, Per,
iuxta, secundum, in, circa, ad, etc. And so when Pla^^* said in Amphi. Haec
heri immodestia cogit me, is the same, that Heri immodestia cogit me ad haec.
Stati. 10. Theb. Quae te leges, praeceptaque belli -- Erudijt genetrix, id est,
erudijt te iuxta leges, and praecepta belli. The reason of this is, because we
see Authors many times to the same noune do take away, and add the
preposition. Cic. 4. Attic. Epist. penu^t. Ad quid laboramus res Romanas? and
the same expres^eth he in a thousand places, Quid laboramus hoc, vel illud,
etc. Plin. in Panag. In tantum diligo optimum principem, in quantum invisus fui
pessimo. Others will say, Tantum quantum. Which Livie wrote lib. 4. In aeternum
urbe condita, and in immensum crescente, Virgil. expressed, sedet aeternumque
sedebit infoelix Theseus, for these are not Adverbes, as some mistake, but
Adiectives, which concord with some substantives, as, Tempus immensum aeternum,
etc. Secondly, this speech may be very well said: Doceo te iuxta omnes vias
sapientiae: although the preposition be taken away, yet it shall be governed by
it, and it is oftentimes an elegancie to put a preposition; always when to the
second noune there shall be put an Adiective, as, Moneo te ad praestantissima
consilia, ad exitus belli difficillimos, ad literas capessendas, ad improbos
labefactandos. Thirdly, when these speeches are turned, as, Tu doceris a me
vias sapientiae, it can never be penetrated, of whom that accusative is
governed, if it be not of some preposition, id est, Tu doceris, monerisque a me
ad vias sapientiae. Verbi gratia, (...), id est, (...), Romanus patriam, id
est, secundum patriam. Fourthly, it is apparent, that this is an imitation of
the Greeks, who oftentimes put accusatives, which are ruled by the preposition
Kata, which is understood in the speech. And if any one shall object, that
those things which have been here delivered, may bear another sense, V. G.
Haec, heri immodestiae cogit me, id est, cogit me haec facere. As well shall
any body rise up against such an one and instance: Doceo te literas id est,
Doceo te s^ire, aut intelligere literas. Haec subintellectio Graecis perquam
familiaris est, Basil. (...). Cain a Diabolo doctus est caedem, scz. facere. By
the delivered premises some phrases of the Poets will be understood, as Vultum
sermon movetur, aut expleri mentem nequit, aut carpitur attonitos sensus, the
Accusatives are governed of a Preposition.

De Ablativo praeter Accusativum.
Verba implendi, vestiendi, Onerandi, Liberandi, and his contraria ac multa
praeterea Privandi, praeter Accusativum Ablativum asciscunt ut, Compleo,
Exhaurio; Induo, Exuo, Onero, Exonero; Libero impleo, privo. Cic: Atti.
Aegritudo me somno private.

Vide 22 and 23 Notes.

The Verbes which besides an Accusative have an Ablative with a Preposition, we
place in the four and twentieth Note; for that many learned men judge that
there ought not to be made a particular order of them, it being understood,
that they are altogether governed by a Preposition.

22 Note.
Induo, Dono, Impertio, Aspergo, may besides an Accusative, admit likewise a
Dative or an Ablative, as Dono te corona, vel tibi coronam. Cic. lib. 1. sibi
torquem induit, vel se torque.

23 Note.
The Ablative of this Rank is ruled by a Preposition which is understood, and
so said, Plaut. Libera te ex onere.

24 Note.
That which others use to dispose in the 6 Order of Actives, we place it among
the Notes, for that it belongs altogether to a Preposition, and so has it
been judged by the learned. Then, all those Verbes have an Ablative with a
Preposition, after an Accusative, which are of this Tenor. Petendi,
Percontandi, and many others, Auferendi, Removendi, Abstinendi, Accipiendi, as
Peto, Quaero, Aufero, Removeo, Abstineo, Faeneror, Mutuor abs te pecuniam.
Likewise those Verbes of understanding, receive the Preposition Ex, and many
others, as Cognosco, Avello, Expello, Quaero, Percontor, Sciscitor a te, vel ex
te. Cic. Poma ex arboribus, fieruda sint, vi avelluntur. To others after an
Accusative is joined an Ablative, with a Preposition, or a Dative, as Furor,
Surripio, Eripio, Aufero tibi, vel a te pecunias.

Finally, all Verbes may have this Ablative with a Preposition: here we will
recite some, besides those which are usually reckoned. Affero. Cic. de sen.
Eique dona a socijs attulisset. Amo. Plaut. Pseud. Vbi sunt isti, qui amant a
Lenone? Idem in Poenu. Amat a Lenone hic. Defendo, Virg. Teneras defendo a
frigore Myrtos. Deijcio. Cicer. Deiecere oculos a republica. Facio. Cic. de
orat. A se aliquid facere. -- Cic. de. Invent. Quod nihilo magis ab
adversarijs, quam a nobis faciet. Habeo, and. Lego. Cic. pro Cluent. Itaque ei
testamento legate pecuniam grandem a filio. Mitto. Cic. Attic. Ab illo mittas
mihi. Munio. Tacit. lib. 10. Saevus ille vultus and rubor, a quo se contra
pallorem muniebat. Numero. Cic. pro Flacco. A Quaestore numeravit. Promitto.
Cic. 2. orat. Ne ipse aliquid a me promisisse videar. Reddo, Cic. Litteras a te
mihi stator tuus reddidit. Cic. 5. Attic. a me solvere. and libr. 7. ab Egnatio
solvat: and pro Plancio. Ab aliquo persolvere. Not these Verbes only, but all
other have this Ablative, with a Preposition, and as the Authors of Arts
hitherto have reckoned Verba Petendi, etc. they might also have cited these:
then it stands with good reason, that there should not be assigned a
particular order of these Verbes, be it that it be taught in general, that
this is a common case, and that it may be applied to any Verbs. These examples
have likewise been produced, for that they make, to the purpose of what shall
be spoken in the following Note.

De constructione Verbi Passivi.
Verbum passivum habet eum Nominativum, qui in Activa Accusativus fuerat. ut,
Colitur Deus; Cui etiam saepissime eleganter adiungitur Ablativus cum
praepositione A, vel Ab. Cic. Attic. An tu existimas ab ullo me malle legi,
quam a te.

Vide 25, 26, 27, Notes.

25 Note.
There are many who think that the Ablative of the Passive with A, or Ab, is
the same that the Nominative of the person Agent is in the Active. Others say,
that the Ablative be it now in the Active, now in the Passive, always
signifies something to be done in the behalf of some body. As when Cic. said
ad Attic. A Bruto legi Antonij edictum, he would say, I have read the Edict of
Anthony, which came from the part of Brutus: which speech if it should be made
in t^is sort, Lectum est edictum a Bruto, would it not be the same that Brutus
legit? these are the two opinions. It is certain that there are an infinite
number of speeches in the Passive, which turned into the Active, will not
express the same, V. G. Caesar the 2. Civil. Tecta munita ab ictu telorum is
not ictus telorum munijt tecta; Cic. 1. leg. Veritas a te postulatur, is not,
tu postulas Veritatem, Emuntur a me Libri, is not, Emo, rather Vendo, and alij
emunt: from whence it appears, that this Ablative which is ruled by the
Preposition, is not a Person which does, for we see that those that have it in
the Passive, retain it in the Active. Plaut. Poen. Amat a Lenonc. Plaut: Rudem
praedam ab eo emerat. Cic. Senect. Dona a socijs attulisset. Idem Atti. A Bruto
legi Antonij edictum. Idem Bruto, Nullas adhuc a te literas habemus. Idem 13.
Attic. Ab illo mihi mittas. Idem pro Flacco. A Quaestore numeravit: and all the
rest of which we have spoken in the precedent Note, which is the 24, in order,
in all these it is found, even as it is in the Active. This Ablative is not a
person that does, as little will it be in the Passive, it is only a Case
governed by a Preposition. And if any will instance that these speeches in the
Passive have two meanings, Verbi Gr. Petitur a me, id est, Ego peto, vel alij a
me petunt, it would be a very great Amphibology, from which the Latins do so
much fly; that they use Reciproques, and a thousand other Rules. I say that it
cannot be denied, that there are some Passive speeches, in which the Ablative
with a Preposition, is the person which does, as Diligitur a Patre meo, Filius
genitus est a Patre, and Filius missusest a Patre, and spiritus sanctus
mittitur a Patre and Filio: and others innumerable, in which clearly the
Ablative with a Preposition, is the person which does, yet according to the
Latins, it is likewise ordinary, that the said Ablative with a Preposition, is
not the person which does, as has been said: and it is seen in an Infinity
of speeches; and for the objection which is made of Amphibology, it is
answered, that this will be understood and avoided by the precedents, and
subsequents, as it falls out in many other speeches, in which there is some
equivocation or amphilogie; for that a Verb or a Noune, has diverse
significations, which noune is acquitted, and understood, by the Antecedent and
Consequent. And it is to be observed for many other respects, that in these
Notes, Documents and Rules are given, for Grammarians and Latin Authors. And
if in the Scripture there have been found Phrases, which are not conformable to
them, the Scripture neither is, nor ought to be tied to the rules of
Grammarians. And the fault of many Grammarians has been, to seek to declare
places of Scripture by their rules, and examine, if the translation from Greek
into Latin, be good or bad, it being not their parts to sift this It
belongs to them to give rules, to understand the Latin Authors: and let them
leave to declare the things and speech^s of the Scripture, to them to whom they
appertain, and who understand them better then they do.

26 Note.
It is very much received, that Vapulo, Veneo, Fio, Exulo, Liceo, are Verbs
Neuter Passives, and they say that they are construed with the Preposition, A
vel Ab: of the two last we will not speak, for that many Authors of Arts have
already forsaken them, finding that it is false: we will speak of the first
three. Many Authors have used this Verb Vapulo, and no body has ever given it
this Ablative, only Quintilian, lib. 9. cap. 2. in these words; Testis rogatus,
an ab reo fustibus vapulasset? and innoceni inquit. But let it be observed,
that this Authority is mistaken, for that Tullius Rufianus, a most ancient
Rhetoritian, speaking of the figure Apophasis delivers these words in this
manner* Testis interrogatus ab reo, number fustibus vapulasset? innocens inquit,
adding this; that no other has assigned this ablative, it seems that it
convinces clearly, that this Verb has not a passive construction.

Secondly, observe that Vapulo does not signify, to be beaten; it is the same
that Perire, velire in malam crucem, it comes out of the Greek verb (...).
It is no marvel that this was not known until now, for that we wanted the
greater part of Festus, which we now enjoy, much restored by the diligence of
Joseph Scaliger. And for Erasmus in the Adagie, Vapula Papyria, does
acknowledge that he cannot understand what it means, for that he wanted
Festus his book. Festus then says thus. Vapula in proverbio antiquis suit, de
quo Sisinius Capito sic refert, tum dici solitum esse, cum vellet minantibus
significare se eos negligere, and non curare fretos iure libertatis. Plaut. in
Faeneral. Heus tu in barbaria quo^ dixisse dicitur liberta suae patronae, ideo
dico^ liberta salve, Vapula Papyria: in Barbaria est in Italia. Aelius hoc
loco, vapula positum esse, ait, pro Dole, Varro pro pe^i, test Teren. in Phor.
Non tu manes S. Vapula P. id tibi quidem iam siet. Et Plaut. Cucul. Reddin, an
non mulierem priusquam te huic meae machaerae obijcio mastigia? S. Vapulare ego
te vehementer iubeo, ne me territes; haec Festus; By these words you shall
clearly see, what we have delivered.

In the word Veneo, likewise, the ill writing of Quintilian has deceived us,
who in the 12. lib. cap. 1. takes this saying from Fabricius, A cive se
spoliari malle quam ab host vaenire; It is to be believed that the place is
false, for that Cic. 2. de Orat. cites that which Fabricius speaks in this
manner: Malo compilari quam venire. Behold how Francis Sanchez does expound
this word in his Minerva.

The Verb Fio is the same, that a verb substantive, and the Greeks esteem
it for the same. So they often take it for esse, Plut. (...): Darius dicebat se
in periculis fieri, sive esse prudentiorem. If sometimes it be found with an
Ablative and a preposition, it is an Ablative of part as we say: Hic amat a
patre suo, anciently it had a passive termination, as also the verb Venio.
Priscian libr. 8. brings authorities hereof. Postquam dintius fitur, and
Graeco ritu fiebantur saturnalia. So as you will rather call it a verb
substantive, as Julius Scaliger terms it, then a neuter passive. And as is
said, Hoc est a te, likewise is said, Hoc fit a te. Observe that when it is
said, Quid me fiet, it is the same that is, Quid de me fiet. As has marked
Father Manuel Alvarez. For Cice. 2. Attic. wrote, Quid de P. Clodio fiat ne
scribe. The same is to be understood of the verb Facio. Cice. 3. in ver. Quid
hoc homine faciat. Teren. And. Nec quid me nunc faciam scio, id est, de me.

27. Note.
We have left the verbes common, for except the participles of them, they are
little used. When Cic. said, A te fictis aggrederer donis, it is a passive of
the verb Aggredio; which was used very long since, and in these days it is
seen in some ancient Authors: the same is observed in others: for if Cic.
said, Ne nos adulari sinamus; the same likewise used the active adulo, before
they were verbes commons. But after those which we call deponents, left the
passive signification, there are found no verbes commons, but as we have
professed, they are passives, for there is not any of those which we call
Verbes commons, which one time or other do not notify their active
signification. Only there has remained a relic of these verbes commons in
some participles: who have action and passion, as these underwritten,
Abominatus, cohortatus, confessus, dimensus, execratus, meditatus, populatus,
testatus, veneratus.

Communes verborum Constructiones.
Interrogatio and Responsio caesu cohaerent. Cui praeceptori dedisti operam?
Flatoni.

Genitivus semper est possessionis, pendetque a nomine substantivo tacito vel
expresso.

28. Note.
A Genitive is always common, and is ruled of some noune, as partly has been
seen in the verbes of price, and accusation. When it is said, Potiri rerum,
there is wanting Imperium. Caesar. 1. Gall. Totius Galliae sese posse potiri
sperant, a little before he said, Totius Galliae imperio potiri. In verbs of
memory, is wanting memoria, mentio, etc. Cic. pro Arch. Pueritiae memoriam
recordari ultimam. And how be it you will say, Pueritiae Recordari: it has
Memoriam to be governed of. These forms of speaking, Desine irarum, abstine
querelarum, are according to the Greeks, who say, (...). Desine laborum pro
(...). a laboribus: as likewise these, Pendeo animi, discrucior animi, although
in these it might be said, that the sense is, Pendeo animi mente, in the same
manner as Plaut Cist. delivered. Nullam mentem animi habeo; and Lucret. Animi
vix mente videmus. In the verb substantive is wanting Munus officium, aut
negotium: Regis est gubernare, id est. officium Regis est gubernare. In those
verbes, Miseret, Miserescit, paenitet, taedet, piget, pudet me tui, the meaning
is, Pudor habet me tui; and so does Priscian expound. Impleo granarium
frumenti; he would say, I fill the Granary, which is for wheat: As, Impleo
pateram Regis. The Poets oftentimes imitate the Greeks, Virg. Implentur veteris
Bacchi.

De Dativo Communi.
Dativus ubicumque reperiatur semper est acquisitionis, est enim in cuius
gratiam, commodum, vel incommodum aliquid fit. Livi. 2. ab urb. condi. Magno
illi ea cunctatio stetit. Eadem ratio est, si iungatur cum verbis passivis,
Cic. Neque senatui, neque populo, neque cuiquam bono probatur. Vbi dativus est
acquisitionis, non persona agens, idem enim in activa invenitur. Cic. pro
Balbo: Non ut vobis rem tam perspicuam dicendo probaremus.

29. Note.
Every dative is of acquisition, for if it be in this, Amo haereditatem filio
meo, why not in this, Do tibi pecunias: peradventure it is not profitable to
give ones money to any. And because this dative is common to all verbes, it is
found most often with verbes actives. Plaut. Asin. Pergin precari pessimo?
Caesar. 3. Gall. Cum tela nostris deficerent. Cic. de orat. Id deceat
prudentiae tuae. Plaut. Amph. Nostro generi non decet. When two datives are
present, they are also of acquisition. The same is to be observed in passive
speeches, as, Deus colitur mihi, where mihi is not a person doer, but a dative
of Acquisition; for in the same manner, you may say in the Active, Cole Deum
mihi; I honor God to my good, or God is honored to my benefit. In Virg. Neque
cernitur ulli, is that same that is, Nulli est conspicuus. The dative of
Acquisition, is the dative of loss or profit. Be advertised by the way, that
as little the person doer is put in the passive signification, in an accusative
with the preposition Per. For it is only a case of the preposition: which you
shall as well put in the active signification, in the same manner and sense.
When Cic. ad Attic. lib. 2. said, Per Praetores Consules creantur, you might
say, Populus creat Consules per Praetores, by means of the Pretors: and also
he delivered the same. Nihil interest per procuratorem agas, an per te ipsum,
and when he said, Res agitur per eosdem creditores, he has not desired to
say, Ipsos creditores agere, sed amicos Regis per creditores.

De Accusativo communi.
Accusativus, praeter eum, qui regitur a verbo activo, semper est communis,
pendetque a praepositione tacita, vel expressa* ut videbitur in sequentibus.

Tempus, si per quam diu fiat interrogatio, effertur accusativo, tacita, vel
expressa praepositione. Livi. Romulus septem, and triginta regnavit annos, vel
per triginta annos. Idem; Obsidio vix in paucos dies tolerabiles, vel paucos
dies.

Dicimus etiam abesse bidui, tridui, sed tum aut per tempus, aut iter, aut viam
subintelligimus quod exprimit Cicero Cat. Aberam ab Amano iter unius diei.
Caesar Be. Gall. Cum bidui viam processisset.

Distantia omnis aut dimensio, Accusativo etiam efferuntur tacita vel expressa
praepositione. Caes. Planicies patebat tria millia passuum, id est, per tria
millia passuum. Lactan. de Phoenice: Per bis sex ulnas eminet ille locus.
Varro. de re Rust. libr. 3. cap. 5. Ad duos pedes altum a stagno, latum ad
quinque: vel, duos pedes altum, latum quinque. His omnibus eleganter adimes
praepositiones, cum velis.

Accusativus cum praepositione Per, communis est omnibus verbis, tam activie,
quam Passivis, and in Passivis non erit persona agens. Caes. 3. Civi. Pompeius
frumentum omne per equites comportaverat, vel comportatum erat frumentum per
equites.

Vide 29 Note in fine.

De Ablativo Communi.
Tempus, modo per Quamdiu, modo per Quando fiat interrogatio, Ablativo
effertur, praepositione tacita, vel expressa. Verres depopulatus est Siciliam
uno triennio, vel in uno triennio, tribus annis, vel in tribus annis. Ter.
Andria. In diebus paucis, quibus haec coacta sunt, vel diebus paucis.

Distantia quoque, and Dimensio Ablativo effertur. Abest itinere unius diei.
Locus latus duobus pedibus.

Omnibus verbis addi potest Ablativus is, qui vulgo absolutus dicitur, qui
tamen re vera pendet a praepositione; ut, Rego Philippo pax floret, id est sub
Rege Philippo.

30 Note.
That which they call an Ablative Absolute is governed of a Preposition, for it
is found with a Preposition most often. Rege Philippo, id est, sub Rege
Philippo. Pers: satyr. 5. Marco sub iudice palle^. Stat. in Syl. Cerealia dona
coronae Sub te test tuli. Virg. Sole sub ardenti resonant arbusta cicadis.
Plin. lib. 18. de muribus, said, sub Authore Aristotele. Other times the
Preposition Cum is supplied, as Musis faventibus. Livi. lib. 1. Dec^ 3. Agite
cum Dijs been invantibus. Plaut. Pers. sequere hac mea guata cum dijs
volentibus. Ennius apud Cic. Doque volentibus, cum magnis Dijs; as well might
other Prepositions be supplied. Observe that this speech. Me consule hoc feci
is good, and Latin, which some hold for barbarous. Cic. in Bruto. Se Audiente
locuples author scribit Thucydides. Idem 15. Fam. Non potes effugere hnius
culpae poenam te patrono. Quintil. Decla. 4. Te volente misisti. Luca: libr. 5.
Et laetos fecit se consule fastos. Ovid. Lachrymas quoque saepe notavi, Me
Lachrymante tuas. Plaut. Mil. Te vidente vides. Of this kind there are very
many examples, and in them all, the Preposition Sub is understood.

Ablativus Instrumenti, Causae, Excessus, aut Modi, quo aliquid fit, omnibus
verbis adiungitur, qui semper pendet a praepositione. Teren. And. Hisce oculis
egomet vidi. Cic. ad Q. Fra. Vestra culpa haec accidunt. Idem. Scipio omnes
sale, facetijsque superabat. Idem de senec. Sapientissimus quisque aequissimo
animo moritur. Causae, Excessui, aut Modo eleganter saepe praepositionem
constitues. Instrumento non ita eleganter.

31 Note.
The Instrument also is governed of a Preposition, for sometimes it is
accompanied with it. Plin. lib. 9. cap. 28. Cirricum quibus venantur, this is
the ancient and true reading of Pliny. Ovid. 4. Fast. verrebat raro cum pectine
pratum. There is not wanting, who changes this Verse for fault of observing
that which we are about to say. Virg. Exercere solum sub vomere. Colum lib. 9.
cap. 1. Semperque de manu cibos and aquam praebere. The Ablative of cause
likewise is ruled of a Preposition. Teren. And. Laborabat e dolor. Cic. 4.
Acad* Maria sole colluent, and of excess. Idem Democritus. Huic in hoc
similis, uberior in caeteris. And of manner, Teren. otiosum ab animo. Plaut.
Trun. Ab ingenio est improbus. Plaut Cap. Rem de compacto geri.

De constructione verbi infiniti.
Verbum infiniti modi post se nominativum habet, cum res ad nominativum
praecedentis Verbi pertinet. Cicer. 1. de Not. Nolo esse longior: Atsi
Accusativus antecessit, and sequatur necesse est. Cic. 1. Cat. Cupio me esse
clementem.

Infinitum Esse accedente verbo Licet, Dandi, vel accusandi casui haeret, cum
caeteris verbis fere accusandi. Cic. 1. Attic. Mihi negligenti esse non licet,
vel negligentem, (subintellecto me) Terent. Heau. Expedit nobis esse bonas,
(subintellecto nos.)

Infinitivus saepe construitur cum alio verbo and resolvitur per, Vt. Virg.
Dederatque comas diffundere vento, pro ut diffunderentur vel se diffunderent.

32 Note.
For that I know that learned men in this faculty do like a sufficient ground
of the construction of the Infinitive; I will speak here how these Budeus
comment. Linguae Graecae. Muret. in Ca^ul. Fran. Brocen. in Miner. Lambi. in
Horat. Henr. Steph. Iul. Scaliger declare it, all who are most learned men. The
infinitive of it self, and according to the Latin ^ules, always requires an
Accusative, Tacit, or express before it, as volo scire, volo me scire. After
it, it requires another Accusative, of any sort whatsoever, one while Me, Te,
Se, may precede; some other times not. Sometimes a Verb of the same
subordination, may be placed before, sometimes not, Cic. pro Quint. Ne ut par
quidem sit postulat, inferiorem esse patitur. Curti. Ad vestras manus confugio,
invitis vobis salvum esse nolo. Plaut. Cist. Quia ego nolo meretricem dicier.
Of such like there are many examples, some Budeus produces pro and con: in
such manner, that answerable to the rules of the Latins, it should be said,
cupio esse clementem. But these Authors d^^learnedly add, that the Authors
have sought ordinarily to forsake their rules, in this particular, and
endeavor to use the construction of the Creekes, for this cupio esse clemens,
is a Greek, not a Latin construction; the reason is, for that the Greeks do
use oftentimes to govern o^e case only, and to join another for elegancy,
although it be not governed of the same part, the first was, and so they say,
Vt^r libris quibus habeo, egeo librorum qu^rum non habeo. Of these speeches
there are an infinity among the Greeks. Then in this speech, Cupio esse
clemens, these Authors learnedly say, that the word Clemens, trahitur a
particula, ego, quae subaudit ur in verbo, Cupio. From hence the reason of this
kind of speaking is easily apprehended. Licet mihi esse negligentem, the which
goes answerable to the rules of the Latins. But this speech, Licet mihi esse
negligenti, is altogether a Greek speech, where the word Negligenti is drawn
from the particle Mihi.

Appen. Cum manetur in eadem persona, accusativus non proprius casus est
infinitivorum, sed potius nominativus tam apud Latinos quam Graecos, Ovid. 13.
Met. Retulit Ajax Esse Iovis pronepos -- 2 Tristium Acoeptum refero versibus
esse nocens, Plutarch in Apothegme: (...). Pericles dicebat vsque ad aram

De Gerundijs.
Gerundiae, quae passionem non significant, casus suorum verborum admittunt:
ut, tempus obliviscendi iniuriarum, ignoscendi inimicis, coercendi cupiditates,
abstinendi maledictis.

Gerundijs in Di, adduntur substantiva, ut, tempus, causa, etc. Et nonnulla
Adiectiva, ut peritus, cupidus. Cicer. de sen. Efferor studio patres vestros
videndi. Idem 2. de orat. Sum cupidus te audiendi.

Gerundijs in Dum, praeponuntur praepositiones Ad, Ob, Inter. Cic. Tus.
Conturbatus animus non est aptus ad exequendum munus suum. Ante, etiam
praeponitur interdum, sed raro.

Gerundia in Do, modo sine praepositione adhibentur: ut, Non sum solvendo. Cic.
lib. 13. Attic. Plorando defessus sum, modo praeposi^iones assumunt. A, Ab, De,
In, nonnunquam, E, vel Ex, Cum, Pro, Quint. lib. 1. Scr^bendi ratio coniuncta
cum loquendo est.

Gerundia, quae passionem significant, nullum post secasum admittunt. Quin.
lib. 2. Memoria excolendo augotur.

Ratio variandi Gerundia.
Gerundia, quae Accusativo casis gaudent, in passiva hac ratione commutantur.
Studios^u d^fendendi Remp* studiosus Reip. defendendae. Plaut. Epid. Epidicum
quaerendo operam dabo frequentius Epidico quaerendo.

33 Note.
At the end of the Gerunds, observe that this phrase is very usual among the
Latins. Tempus est legendi librorum. Plaut. Aulul. Nominandi tibi istorum,
magis erit, quam eundi copia. Cic. de Inventute. Fuit exemplorum eligendi
potestas. Idem de univers. Reliquorum syderum, quae causa collocandi fuerit.
Sueton. Aug. Permissa iocandi licentia, diripiendique pomorum, and obsonioru^,
and missilium. Plin. in Epist. Cum illorum videndi gratia, me in forum
contulissem. The Grammar of these speeches is, Tempus est legendi librorum, id
est, lectionis librorum. So learned men expound.

Participiale in Dum.
Participiale in Dum, accedente verbo substantivo, dativo iungitur, post se
habet casum sui verbi. Cic. 2. Tusc. Tuo tibi iudicio utendum est; si tamen
casus verbi, fuerit accusativus, mutabitur oration hoc modo; Petendum est tibi
pacem, petenda est tibi pax.

34. Note.
It is to be noted, that the dative of this Participiall is of acquisition: and
so, Docendum est mihi, is not, I must teach, but there must be teaching for my
good. Docendum est discipulis, there must ^e Indoctrination for the profit of
the Scholars, and it is evident, for the Ancients expressed. Petendum est tibi
pacem; Const^tuendum est paenam latronibus. Figendum est crucem malefactoribus,
id est: There must be required peace for thee; There must b^ constituted
punishment for Thieves, etc. which are ren^red in this manner: Petenda est tibi
pax; Constituenda poena latronibus; Figenda crux malefactoribus. And this self
some dative you may put in the Active, Serviendum mihi est Deo. Serviam Deo
mihi.

De Supinis.
Supina in um, amant verba, quae motum adsignificant, and ante se nullum, post
se suorum verborum casum habent. Teren. Phorm. Me ultro accusatum advenit.

Voces illae, quae vulgo dicuntur Supina in V. nominibus adiectivis haerent.
Virg. Mirabile visu.

35. Note.
Many learned men there are, who exclude that which we call the last Supine,
saying that it is a noune, and it seems they fail not therein. First because
they may be datives, for that Virg. who wrote Mirabile visu, in another part
said, Oculis mirabile monstrum. Where Mirabile visu will be the same that
Mirabile visui. And there is no inconvenience that it be so; for even as the
Latins say, Parce metu, pro me tui, they may likewise say, Mirabile visu, pro
visui. Secondly, we see these nounes concord with adiectives, Quint. lib. 8.
Rebus atrocibus verba etiam ipso auditu acerba magis convenient. Agellius lib.
12. Eos versus assiduo memoratu dignos puto. Stati. 9. The^ log. Longo defessa
redibat Venatu. Of these are many examples. The which some answer, saying that,
Res digna memoratu, is the last Supine: yet that Res digna magno memoratu, is a
noune, does not satisfy, for, if I would only say a thing worthy of memory,
I will say, Memoratu. If I desire to add ought else, I will say, Magno
memoratu, incredibili, ingenti, etc. From whence it will appear to be now a
noune. Thirdly, the connection of speeches in form, that these are Nounes.
Wherefore the Authors (it seems without doubt) would join two Nounes, in the
subsequent speeches. Livi. lib. 31. Id dictu quam re facilius. P^in. lib. 7.
Parvum dictu, sedimmensum aestimatione. Cice. in Piso. Quis enim te auditu,
quis ullo honor, quis denique communi salute dignum putavit. ^acit. lib. 1.
Lucos visu, ac memoria deformes. This reason has more force with the
Grammarians, that a conjunction joins the like cases. Fourthly, the Spanish
phrases are so hard, with which are declared these speeches, that they give the
matter in hand to be understood as false. For this is Spanish, Affabilis dictu;
Affabile de ser dicho, o, aefable que se diga. Affable to be said, or affable
that it be said. Explicabile dictu. Explicabile do ser dicho, to be explicable
to be spoken. How much better it is. Explicabile dictu, id est, dictione vel
sermon. Explicable with a word. Some body will demand, what nounes are these,
since there is no dictus, dictus, dictui. To this is answered, that many of
these are entire Nounes, as Venatus, cubitus, etc. And others are de^ective,
which the Ancients only in the datives, and ablatives singular, as Vis, Vim, a
Vi. Opis, opem, ab open, and many others.

De Participijs.
Participia eosdem casus habent, quos verba a quibus proficiscuntur. Livi. lib.
1. ab Vr. Anius, ingenti praeda potitus, Romam redijt.

Exosus, perosus, pertaesus, cum accusativo efferuntur. Livi. 3. Ab ur. Plebs
regum nomen perosa erat.

Participia praesentis cum fiunt nomina, and nonnulla quae dicuntur praeteriti,
interrogandi casu gaudent. Cice. Atti. 9. Boni cives amantes patriae. Sallu.
Cat. Aliem appetens, profusus sui.

Appendix.
Aliquando id quod in oratione deest, foris omnino petendum est, Cic. In Verrem
5. Ridere convivae, cachinnari ipse Apronius, scz caepit Hoc apud Graecos
frequenti venit usu, Mat. 4. (...), Iacobus Zebedaei* scz. (...), filius. Sic
dicitur Deiphobe Glauci. Hectoris Andromache, etc quod explicat Par. Sy. (...)
Iacobus filius Zebedaei, etc. ibidem.

Aliquando una pars orationis ponitur pro alia, ut Virg. Horrendum stridens pro
horrendo, Graeca est haec constructio.

De Pronomine.
Possessiva Meus, tuus, suus, noster, vester, genitivo iunguntur tam
substantivorum, quam adiectivorum. Cic. 2. Phil. Tuum hominis simplicis pectus
vidimus. Mea unius interest. Rempublicam defendere.

Vbi mei and ^ui genitivi primitivorum in possessivis constructionem aperiunt.

36. Note.
In the first example the genitive Hominis is ruled of pectus. the second has
already been handled in the 10. Note, on the verb Interest.

Nomina Numeralia, Partitiva, comparativa, and superlativa genitivos nostrum,
vestrum habent. Nostri tamen and vestri caeteris iunguntur. Curt. l. 8. Nolo
singulos vestrum excitare. Cic. 4. Cat. Habetis ducem memorem vestri, oblitum
sui.

Reciproca, sui, sibi, se.
Reciproco, sui, utimur, cum tertia persona transit in seipsam, etiam accedente
verbo. Cic. Qui a me petierit, ut secum, and apud se essem quotidie.

Suus, etiam utimur, cum tertia persona transit in rem a se possessam, Cice. 5.
Verb. Aiebat multa sibi opus esse, multa canibus suis.

Cum duae tertiae personae in oratione praecedunt, sui, and suus tantummodo
utemur, cum ad verbi suppositum prius, aut principalius referimus. Sed si nulla
sit ambiguitas, hoc praecepto non astringimur. Cic. 2. Phi. Hic rogat civem, ut
secum coeat societatem.

37. Note.
These rules of Reciproques are only to eschew Amphibology, and so they may
be left wheresoever there shall not be found this hazard, for in Latin may
be well said: Cepi columbam in nido suo, v^l eius vel ipsius, supposed that
there be no danger of Amphibologie. So the Greeks expressing this Reciproque,
Suus, a, um, in the singular number, masculine, and neuter genders, use the
genitive (...), or (...). In the feminine (...) or (...). In the plural number
(...) or (...), in all genders and cases. Ioh. 3. (...). Sic Deus dilexit
mundum, ut filium suum unigenitum daret, etc. Some there are who have taught,
that to say in Nido suo, is a solecisme, in which they err: Ovid. in Epist.
Aspice Laerten, ut iam sua lumina condas. Cic. 2. In Verrem: Vt non modo in
auribus vestris, sed in oculis omnium sua furta atque flagitia defixurus sim.
Seneca ad Albinam matrem. Puer ad tuum formetur arbitrium, multum sibi dabis,
etiamsi nihil dederis praeter exemplum. Plin. Vinea si marcuerit, sarmenta sua
comburito. Valor. Max lib. 4. ca. 3. Alexander Diogenem gradu suo divitijs pel
lere tentat, suo, id est, Diogenis. Some of these examples, and others of other
Authors, as are, Virg. Salust. etc. Laurentius Vala, for that he has not
observed, what has been here delivered.

Note also that when two persons come in the same sentence, the ancients have
used another Pronoune to take away ambiguitie. So speaks Quintil. in his
declamation: Non sic repugnassei si illum Tribunus voluisset occidere. For if
he had said ( se) it could not be understood whether was meant the man accused,
or the Tribune. Like as in this: Rogavit Nero Epaphroditum ut se occideret* A
man cannot tell who is meant, Nero or Epaphroditus.

De constructione Prepositionum.
Verba composita saepe casum Praepositionis habent, tacita, vel repetita
Praepositione. Cice. Fin. Pythagoras Persarum Magos adijt vel ad Magos.

Versus suo casui postponitur. Cic. Arpinum versus, Itemque, Tenus, iungiturque
Genitivo plurali, vel Ablativo singulari: ut oculorum tenus, capite tenus.

In, cum quies, aut aliquid fieri in loco significatur, vel ponitur pro Inter,
Ablativum amat, alioquin Accusativum: ut sum in templo, deambulo in foro.
Cicer. Ami. Nisi in honis amicitia esse non potest. Brutus fuit pius in
patriam, crudelis in liberos.

Sub pro Circiter, Per, Paulo, Ante, Post, and cum tempus adsignificat,
accusativum amat. Cice. 10. Fam. Sub eas literas statim recitatae sunt tuae;
sub vesperum, sub noctem, sub Lucis ortum: sub idem tempus. Eadem cum verbis
Motus Accusativum, cum verbis Quietis Ablativum petit, ut, Clodius se sub
scalas tabernae librariae coniecit. consedimus sub umbra platani.

Super, Accusativo servit: Ablativo vero cum pro De, ponitur, and interdum cum
verbis Quietis. Tegula cecidit super caput. Cice. Atti. lib. 16. Hac superre
scribam ad te. Virg. 1. Ecl. Fronde super viridi.

Subter ferme Accusativum poscit, sive quietis* sive motus verbis adiungatur.
Cic. 1. Tus. Plato cupiditate^ subter praecordia locavit.

38 Note.
Some of these Prepositions, by learned men are held for Adverbs, as Versus,
for in this Italiam versus, the Preposition is understood Ad, Id est Ad Italiam
versus. And this is the cause wherefore we have left out, from the number of
Prepositions, both seous and usque.

De Adverbio.
En and Ecce Nominandi, and Accusandi casibus adhaerent, qui semper pendent ab
aliquo verbo, ut, En turba, id est, En turba adest, En hominem, id est, en,
vide hominem: similiter in Adverbio, Ecce.

39 Note.
These cases are governed of some Verb, which commodiously may be understood.
An Argument hereof is, that Authors have used them so a thousand times. Teren.
Adelp. Ecce autem hic adest senex noster. Plaut. Merca. Ecce illum video.

Adverbia Loci.
Adverbia, quibus interrogamur, sunt haec, Vbi, Vnde, Quo, Qua, Quorsum.

De Adverbio vbi.
Cum Interrogatio fit per Adverbium, ubi, si respondendum sit per nomina
propria Pagorum, Castellorum, Vrbium, Provinciarum, Insularum, Regionum:
primae, vel secundae, declinationis ponuntur in Genitivo: ut, Sum Romae,
Brundusij, Siciliae, Cretae; Qui Genitivus regitur a subintellecto nomine Vrbe,
Oppido, Loco, Provincia, Regno, Insula, and Grammatica erit* Sum Romae, id est,
In Vrbe Romae; Siciliae, id est, In Insula Siciliae.

40 Note.
Mark first that the names of Provinces, Islands, and Kingdoms, may be also
put in the Gen^ive. Varro. lib. 1. cap. 7. ^retae ad Cortiniam dicitur Platanus
esse. Cice. in Verram. Sicilia cum essem Idem, Attic. Cum Cor^yrae ^pala^^
essemus. Val. Max. lib. 4. cap. 1. Duos egregiae indolis fil^os suos a
Gabinianis militibus Aegyptio o^eisos cognovit. Sal. Iug. Romae Numidiaeque
facinora eius memorat. We have set down the rule as it runs, and the same
doctrine is kept in the following rules. And it is good that they who learn,
know that these forms of speaking are delivered very elegantly in Latin. Sum
Siciliae, vel in Sicilia Eo Sicilia^* vel ad Siciliam. Eo Romam, vel ad Romam,
venio Sicilia, vel ex Sicilia. Venio Roma, vel ex Roma; for some have an
opinion, that to say: sum Siciliae, eo ad Romam, venio ex Roma, etc. are
solecismes, some answer that it is least used. To this I say, that in Titus
Livius, and the best Historians and Poets, it is ordinary to leave out
Prepositions in Provinces, and to use them to Cities, and Cic. does so most
often, and there is none of these things, of which there are not more then 500.
examples, and Suetonius says of Caesar, that he put always Prepositions to
names of people, for that he liked well, that his language should be clear.
And if by the authority of Quintilian only it was taught that Vapulo was a
Neuterpassive, it being not, it is no wonder that this is taught here, ratified
by so many authorities as there are produced.

Secondly, observe that these genitives are of Possession, for they have their
Rection of some Substantive understood: which sometime Authors have expressed.
Cic. 5. Attic. In oppido Antiochiae. Idem Phil. 4. Albae constiterunt in urbe
opportuna. And so the Grammar is, sum Romae, id est, in urbe Romae. Siciliae,
id est, in Provincia Siciliae. Athenis, Babylone, id est, in Athenis, in
Babylone. Sueton. Call. cap. 8 in Treviris.

Thirdly, note this word Ruri, of which mention is made below, is no Dative, as
many opinionate, but an Ablative, for that the Ancients ended Ablatives in E,
oftentimes in I. Plaut. Men: Satur nunc loquitur de me and de parti m^a, Cat.
cap. 37. Ex segeti vellito ebulum. Virgil. Eclog. 6. serta procul tantum capiti
delapsa iacebant. Auson. de occasion. Heus tu, occipiti calvo es. In this
manner it is found in many, Vesperi pro Vespere: in that which concerns the
noune Domus: be it known, that it may be said, sum domi, vel in domo: Eo
domum, vel ad domum, venio domo, vel, ex domo. The same in the noune Rus; of
all these are many examples in the Authors, which Franciscus Sanchez has
spoken of in his Minerva.

Si propria tamen fuerint tertiae Declinatinationis, vel Pluralis numeri, sexto
casu utendum est. Cic. Divi. Babylone Alexander mortuus est. Idem. Atti. 16.
Athenis esse. Hic casus pendet a praepositione In.

Sed nomina Provinciarum, Insularum, and Regionum frequenter sunt in Ablativo
cum praepositione in, quibus ad haerent nomina Appeliaetiva, ut, sum in
Sicilia, in Creta, in foro, in Vrbe. Dicimus etiam Rure, vel Ruri in Ablativo.
Plaut. Bacchi. Si illi sunt virgae ruri, at mihi tergum domi est.

Propria sequuntur appellativa quatuor Humi, Belli, Militiae, Domi, quorum
postremo adiungi possunt, Meae, Tuae, Suae, Nostrae, Vestrae, Alienae. Cic.
Tusc. Theodori nihil refert humine, an sublime putrescat.

Si responsio fiat per Adverbia, redduntur haec. Hic, Isthic, Illic, Ibi,
Inibi, Ibidem, Alibi, Alicubi, Vbique, Vtrobique, Vbilibet, Vbivis, Vbicumque:
Passim, vulgo, Intus, Foris, Nusquam, Long, Peregre, and supra, subter, Infra,
Ante, Post, Extra, Cic. 6 Fam. Nemo est, quin ubivis, quam ibi ubi est, esse
malit.

De Adverbio Vnde.
Cum per unde fit interrogatio, si respondetur per propria Vrbium, aut
Provinciarum, utemur Ablativo, tacita, vel expressa praepositione, ut venio
Roma, Brundusio, Carthagine Athenis, Sicilia, Creta, Rure, Domo: vel ex Roma,
ex Brundusio, ex Carthagine, ex Athenis, ex Sicilia, ex Creta.

In Appellativis semper exprimitur praepositio, ut, Ex foro, ex Vrbe.

41 Note.
It is not only said Venio Roma, Carthagine, etc. but likewise, A Roma, a
Carthagine, ab Athenis, etc. Cice. 1. Acad. Venisse ab Roma. idem Phil. 8. Ab
Alexandria discederet. Fla. Bacch. Ex Epheso huc ad sodales literas misi, and
Pseud. Ex Sicyone huc pervenisti. Martial. lib. 13. Haec de vitifera venisse
picata Vienna.

Secondly, it is not only said, Venio ex Italia, but also Italia. Sueton.
Vespasian, ut eo tempore Iudaea profecti rerum potirentur, and Aug. Decedens
Macedonia. Cic. Attic. Si Pompeius Italia cederet. Val. Max. lib. 1. cap. 7.
Paenorum exercitum Italia pelleret; From whence you may collect, that they are
governed by a preposition, expressed or tacit.

Si per adverbia fiat responsio, redduntur Haec, hinc* isthinc, illhinc,
indidem, aliunde, undelibet, undevis, undique, undecumque, alicunde, utrinque,
Eminus, Cominus, superne, inferne, peregre, intus, foris. Terent. Heau. Vide,
ne quo hinc abeas longius.

De Adverbio Quo.
Quando per Adverbium Quo, fiat interrogatio, nomina propria urbium, and
Provinciarum reddentur in accusativo, tacita, vel expressa praepositione: ut,
Eo Romam, Brundusium, Carthaginem, Athenas, Siciliam, Cretam, Rus, Domum, Vel,
ad Romam, ad Brundusium, ad Carthaginem, ad Athenas, ad Siciliam, ad Cretam.

42. Note.
It is not only said, Eo Romam, but likewise, Ad Romam. Cic. de Sen, Miles
profectus sum ad Capuam, quintoque anno post ad Tarentum. Quaestor. Caesar. 3.
Civil. Cassius ad Messanam navibus evocavit. Propert. lib. 3. Ad doctas
proficisci cogor Athenas Plaut. Bacchi. In Ephesum hinc abij, and Epid, Quando
hinc iturus est in Seleuciam.

Secondly, it is not only said, Eo Italiam, but likewise In Italiam. Cic. pro
lege Manilia. Sardiniam cum class venit. Suet. Aug. ca. 17. Ab Actio cum Samum
Insulam, In Hybernia se recepisset. Justin. lib. 20. Aegyptum primo profectus
Cretam contenderat. Tacit. lib. 2. Germanicus Aegyptum pro ficiscitur. Mela.
lib. 3. cap. 6. Aegyptum tendere. Virg. Tendimus Italiam. There are very many
examples of this kind in Livi.

Thirdly observe, that sometimes nounes Appellatives are found without a
preposition, but it is not good to use it ordinarily, Virg. l. 6. Devenere
locos laetus, and amaeno vireta. Apul. lib. 9. Proximam civitatem deducere
consueverunt.

Appollativis additur praepositio: ut, Ad forum, ad urbem.

Vide 42. Note.

Adverbia reddentur haec: Huc, istuc, illhuceo, eodem, illo, aliquo, alio,
n^utro, utroque, quoque, quocumque, quovis, quolibet, intro, for as, peregre,
long, nusquam. Teren. Hecy. Abi Parmeno intro.

De Qua.
Si per Qua fiat interrogatio, per propria respondentes, Ablativo utemur, vel
accusativo cum praepositione, Per: ut, Qua iter fecesti? Roma, Brundusio,
Carthagine, Athenis, Rure, Domo: vel, per Romam, per Brundusium, per
Carthaginem, per Athenas.

43. Note.
Observe first that there are very learned men that h^ld Qua, which ordinarily
is held for an Adverbe, to be the Ablative of Quis, supplying Via, as, Qua iter
fecisti? id est, Qua via iter fecisti? this appears very probable; for that
all these which answer to it, are such to which Via may be supplied, as, hac
via, etc.

Secondly, it is to be noted, that not only may it be said, Feci iter Roma,
but also Per Romam. Howbeit of the one and the other there are few examples;
for ordinarily they expressed it by other ways, as, Cum transirem Romam,
praeterijssem Brundusium, Attigissem Capuam, etc.

Proprijs Provinciarum, and Appellativis clare additur praepositio Per: ut, per
Siciliam, per Cretam, per forum, per Vrbem.

Cum rogamur per Qua, reddemus etiam Haec. Hac, isthac, illhac, aliqua,
qualibet, quacumque. Terent. Eun. hac, illhac, perfluo.

De Adverbio Quorsum.
Si per Quorsum fiat interrogatio, quaecumque sint nomina ponuntur in
accusativ^, cum hac voce, versus, Vt Quorsum tendis? Romam versus, Siciliam
versus.

Redduntur etiam haec Adverbia, Horsum, istorsum, illorsum, aliorsum, sursum,
deorsum, dextrorsum, sinistrorsum, laevorsum, prorsum, rursum, introrsum, vel
introrsus, re^rorsum vel retrorsus, quoquoversum vel quoquoversus, Teren.
Phorm. Horsum pergunt.

Satis, abunde, affatim, parum, i^star, ergo pro causa. Genitivum postulant:
Teren Phorm. satis iam verborum est.

Pridie, and postridie, and genitivo and accusativo eleganter iunguntur. Pridie
eius ^iei venit. postridie ludos Apollinares.

Propius, and proxime accusativo adhaerent. Propius urbem* proxime Italiam, id
est, ad Vrbem, ad Italiam.

Some insert here a large Catalogue, how some Adverbs are to be used, which you
shall see in the 45. Note.

44. Note.
In the Adverbes Propius and proxime, the preposition Ad is understood, by
which the accusative is ruled: which sometimes the Latins do conceal for
elegancie, and others have expressed it. Cic. in Partit. Accedere propius ad
sensum alicuius, and 1. de natura Deo. Ad similitudinem enim Deo propius
accedebat humana virtus, and pro Mil. Proxime ad Deos accessit Clodius. For if
these govern an accusative, why say they not, that Proximus also does govern
an accusative, since Plaut. said in Paenul. Proximus te sum? But here and in
the rest the preposition ad, ought to be understood, which Ovid expressed when
he said, Proximus ad dominam nullo prohibente sedeto.

45. Note.
Vt, when it signifies Postquam, is joined to an Indicative: Cic. Vt ab vrbe
discessi: and when it imports the same that Quomodo, with a certain
admiration. Ter. Vt falsus es animi!

Vt, after these words, Adeo, ita, sic, tam, talis, tantus, tot, is joined
ordinarily to the Subiunctive mood, Cic. Non sum ita hebes, ut ista dicam.

Antequam and priusquam, are joined to an Indicative and a Subiunctive. Cic.
Priusquam de Rep. dicere incipio, vel incipiam*

Ne, when we command that any thing be not done, is put with a Subiunctive and
an Imperative. Ne jures, ne jura.

Nae, id est, profecto, if it shall be put before any Pronoune is joined to an
Indicative; or a Subiunctive. Teren. Adelph. Nae ego sum infaelix. Cic. 1. Ph.
Nae tu, si id fecisses, melius famae tuae consuluisses.

The adverbes in um, and these words, Per, perquam, quam sane* and others such
like, are joined with positives nounes, as, Perfacilis. Cic. 2. Fin. In rebus
apertissimis nimium longi sumus.

Adverbs ending in, O, are joined with comparatives. Multo and Long to
comparatives and superlatives, Cice. 1. Offi. Quanto superiores sumus, tanto
nos submissius geramus. Idem in Ver. Arrogantia ingenij est mul^o molestissima.
Idem in Brut. Servilius long post natos homines improbissimus.

It is likewise said, Facile doctissimus, and Quam doctissimus.

Note that Adiectives signifying time, are as well by the Latin as Greek
Poets often put in place of the Adverbs, as, Virg. 3. Georg. Nec gregibus
nocturnus obambulat, id est, nocturn^ vel noctu: so Aenead. 8. Nec minus Aeneas
se matutinus agebat, for mane: so Homer. Il. 13. (...); Non decet virum
consiliarium dormire nocturnum, id est, per totam noctem. And sometimes in
Prose. Plin. Haec singula and matutina and vespertina dantur, pro mane and
vesperi.

De Interiectione.
O, Heu, and Proh. Nominandi, Accusandi, and Vocandi casibus junguntur, ut O
pietas, Heu cladem, Proh Jupiter.

Hei, and vae Dativo gaudent: ut, hei mihi; vaetibi. Omnes hi casus aliunde
reguntur, quam ab Interi^ctionibus.

46 Note.
To an Interiection are joined the said Cases, for it seems not probable that
they govern them. The Nominative is never governed of any, only it
concordeth. It cannot be understood how a Vocative should rule, since it is
that to which the speech is directed. In all other Cases something is
inexpressed, as, Vae tibi, id est, Vae tibi imminet supplicium, vel quid
simile, etc. O, me miserum, id est, O, poena manet me miserum, etc. O, Jupiter,
id est, O, ubi es Jupiter, insomuch as Virg. O, ubi campi, id est, O, ubi sunt
campi. And this is evident, for without any prejudice of the speech, the
Interiection may be left out: as Me miserum quantis assicior! Jupiter quid mali
foci! Misero mihi, quanta me premunt mala! Then behold you from whence these
cases be governed, when there is no Interiection, which when they have them,
shall be governed by the self same part: from whence comes it, that in good
Prints, is put always after an Interiection, a Comma, or rather sign, which
would not be done, if the case following should be governed thereof, as Vae,
mihi misero, O Jupiter.

De Coniunctione.
Coniunctiones copulativae and disiunctivae Orationes coniungunt,
disiunguntque, casus etiam similes, cum ad idem verbum referuntur, sed hoc non
necessario: ut, Caesar pugnat, and Cicero scribit; forma and gloria fragilis
est; Horatius. Aut ob avaritiam, aut misera ambitione laborat. Cic. 4. Epist.
Me, and tibi exire ex urbe necesse sit.

47 Note.
It was wont to be said, that a Conjunction joins necessarily alike Cases,
which is false, as well appears by the two last examples of Horace, and
Cicero, as also for that construction requires oftentimes the contrary, V. Gr.
fuisti Romae, an Athenis?

48 Note.
Etsi, Tametsi, Quanquam, in the beginning of a speech, are very elegantly
joined to an Indicative, but in the middle, and end of a speech, they are
joined to an Indicative, or to a Subiunctive. Cic. pro Milone. Etsi vereor
Iudices. Teren. And Obtundis tametsi intelligo, vel intelligam. Etiamsi
Quamvis, Licet, ut, when it is taken for Quamvis, require a Subjunctive. Cice.
de Amici. omnia brevia, and tolerabilia esse debent, etiamsi maxima sunt.

Tam and Quam are ordinarily annexed to positives, sometimes to superlatives,
very seldom to Comparatives, Tam Doctus, quam Sapiens.

De ut, and Ne, after the Verbs, Timeo, Metuo, Vereor.
When we fear what we desire not, we must say, Timeo ne; when we fear what
we desire, Timeo ut, as, Timeo ne pater veniat, when I desire not his coming.
Timeo ut pater veniat, when I desire his coming. Timeo ne non, is the same
that Timeo ut, (and not the same as Timeo Ne, as some teach) for that two
Negatives make an Affirmative. Cic. Attic. 9. Timeo non impatre^, id est, timeo
impatre^. Yet Timeo, ut non, vel Timeo, ut ne, or some other negative
whatsoever: as, Timeo ut nolit, Timeo ut nihil faciat, in all these it is the
same, as Timeo ne. Finally adding the third negation, it is understood, that
one has no kind of fear. Cic. 6. in Ver. Non vereor ne hoc officium Servilio
non probem, id est, non dubito quin hoc officium meum sim probaturus Servilio.
The same which has been said in Timeo, is to be understood in Metuo, and
Vereor.

FINIS.
