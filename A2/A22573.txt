By the King. His Majesty's Proclamation restraining the abuses in Gold
Weights fraudulently committed contrary to a former.
WHere Our Sovereign Lord the King by Proclamation given at the Court at White
Hall the Twentieth Day of December, in the Eighth year of His Majesty's
Reign: for reformation of great abuses in the Counterpoises and Weights of His
money of Gold, and Grains and half Grains to be used in poysing of them,
did publish and declare that the Weights wherewith his Majesty's money of Gold
should be poised after the six and Twentieth day of January then next
ensuing, should be made of a round and Circular form, wherein should be
inscribed certain marks that they might easily be known from Weights
formerly used, which should be of the full and just size according to the true
Weights of the Gold moneys, and the Grains and half Grains should be apart
by themseiues to show the remedies and abatements as they ought to be, and
none of them should be made with the remedies and ^batements purposely taken
off, (commonly called Blancke-Weights;)

And for the better effecting of His Majesty's pleasure, His Majesty did
commit the care of Making and Assizing of those Counterpoyses and weights to
Sir Thomas Aylesbury, Baronet, one of the Masters of Request, whom his Majesty
commanded to have in readiness in the Lowre of London, sufficient numbers of
the said Weights, Grains, and half Grains, with just and equal Beams and
Balances for the use of them, exactly and diligently made and sized to furnish
His Subjects by the said six and twentieth day of January, to be issued at
reasonable prizes;

And His Majesty's will and Pleasure was, that the Chief Officers, in all
Cities, Boroughs and Towns Corporate, with all Convenient speed, should
provide one pair of the said Weights and Balances, sufficient, at the hands
of the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury, or such as he should appoint to deliver the
same, made according to the fashion aforesaid, within every such City, Borough
and Town Corporate; well and safely to be kept, that such as would, might have
recourse and access unto them, for discerning of the true weights of His
Majesty's Moneys of Gold, whereof receipts or payments should be, as occasion
should require;

And his Majesty did straightly Inhibite all His Subjects, and others
whatsoever within His Dominions, after the said six and twentieth day of
January, to have, or use any other weights, of, or for the Coins of Gold, and
remedies thereof, then only such as should be made circular, and sized and
issued by the appointment of the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury. And that no person,
or persons, of what estate, degree, or condition soever they were or should be,
should at any time then after presume to make, cast, contriue, frame or cause
to be made any Counterpoyses, or Weights, Grains or half Grains, or any
Tool or Instrument, Press, Mill, Stampes, Punchions, Counterpunchions, or any
thing else whatsoever, for the making, casting, framing or preparing of such
weights, or vent, or import the same made, other then the said Sir Thomas
Aylesbury, or such as should be thereunto appointed by his Majesty, upon
pain of His Majesty's High Indignation and displeasure, and such other pains
and penalties, as by the Laws and Statutes of His Majesty's Realm, or by His
Majesty's Prerogative Royal, could or might be inflicted upon contemners of
His Majesty's Proclamations and Royal Commands;

And it was His Majesty's pleasure, that in receipts and payments of His
Majesty's moneys of Gold, none should be compelled to try the Weight thereof
by other Poyses or Weights then those that should be made of a form circular,
as is before set forth;

Sithence which time some evil disposed persons, without the assent, and
against the will of the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury have presumed to make diverse
Counterpoyses and Weights of His Majesty's Moneys of Gold, and Grains, and
half Grains for poysing thereof, which were unequal and defective, which
were endeavored to be put to sale, which being discovered by the care of the
said Sir Thomas Aylesbury, according to duty, and in discharge of the trust
reposed in him, he made the same known to the Lords of His Majesty's Privy
Counsel: and thereupon those false Counterpoises, Weights, Grains and half
Grains were seized upon, and being found defective, are by command melted
down, whereby a great inconvenience which might otherwise happen to His
Majesty's people is prevented: And some of the Delinquents have for that
attempt been chastised:

Our said Sovereign Lord the King of His great and abundant care that His
Justice, both in His Courts and Commerce amongst His people be duly
administered and observed, and that His people be not deceived with false
Weights, which are abominable: by the advice of His Privy Counsel, does
again straightly Inhibite all His Subjects, that none of them do make, form,
or offer to put to sale any Counterpoyses or Weights of the moneys of Gold, or
Grains, or half Grains to be used in poysing thereof, but the said Sir
Thomas Aylesbury, or such as first shall have License from the said Sir Thomas
Aylesbury, to vent the same;

And does also by these presents, straightly inhibite all His Subjects and
others whatsoever within His Dominions, to have, or use publicly, or privately
in shoppes or elsewhere any other Weights of or for the Coins of Gold and
remedies thereof, then only such as shall be made circular and sised, and
issued by the appointment of the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury:

And does likewise charge the said Sir Thomas Aylesbury, that he shall employ
none in making, venting, or issuing of any such Counterpoyses, Weights, Grains
or half Grains, but in such manner as in the said former Proclamation is
specified: Letting all men know, His Majesty intends with all severity to
proceed against all such as shall contemn, or not yield obedience to this and
His said former Proclamation.

Given at the Court at Greenewich this fist day of May, in the tenth year of
the Reign of Our Sovereign Lord CHARLES, by the grace of God King of ENGLAND,
SCOTLAND, FRANCE, and IRELAND, Defender of the Faith, etc.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty: and by the Assigns of John Bill. 1634.
