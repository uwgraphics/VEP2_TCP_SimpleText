The confession of the faith of the Germaynes exhibited to the most victorious
Emperor Charles the.v. in the Council or assemble holden at Augusta the year
of our lord. 153^

To which is added the Apology of Melancthon who defends with reasons
invincible the aforesaid confession translated by Richard Tauerner at the
commandment of his Master the right honorable Master Thomas Cromwell chief
Secretary to the kings grace.

Psalmo. 119. And I spoke of thy testimonies in the presence of kings, and I
was not confounded.

To the right honorable Master Thomas Crumwell chief Secretary to the kings
grace / and master of his Rolls his humble servant Richard Tauerner wysheth
continual health and prosperity.
WHo ca^ not onles he be mortally infected with the pestyferous poison of envy
most hyghly commend magnifye and extolle your right honorable maistershipes
most circu^specte godlynes and most godly circumspection in the cause and
matter of our Christyan religyon which with all indifferency do not only
permit the pure true and sincere preachers of gods word freely to preach /
but also your self to the vttermoste of your power do promote and further the
cause of Christ and not only that / but also do animate and encourage other
to the same* As now of late ye have animated and impelled me to translate the
Confession of the faith and the defense or Apology of the same / which book
after the judgment and censure of all indifferente wise and learned men is as
frutful and as clerkly composed as ever book was until this day which have
been publyshed or set forth. But to the end that the people for whose sakes
this book was commanded to be translated may the more gredely devour the
same / I do dedicate and commend it to your name / and if any faults have
eschaped me in this my translation I desyer not only your maystershype but
also all that shall read this book to remember the sayng of the poet Horace
which i^ art poetica says. In opere longo fas est obrepere somnum. That is
to say / in a long work it is lawefull for an man to fall some times a
sleep. But as touching your right honorable maystershype I doubt nothing
(such is your inestimable humanity) but that ye will accep^e this my little
service and take it in worth whom I beseech the hight god that he will
vouchsaue to further in all your affairs to the glory of god and auauncement
of his name. Amen.

The preface to the Emperor Charles the fyfte.
Most inuycte Emperor Caesar Auguste lord most gracyous. For asmoche as your
emperyall majesty has summoned a parliament or assemble of the Empire to be
holden at the City of Ausbrough to thentent that there it might be consulted
and delyberated of the aids and socours to be had against the Turk that most
bitter / hereditarie / and old ennemie of the Christyan name and religion
(that is to wit) how his furiousnes and cruel enforcementes might be
resisted with durable and perpetual ordinance and provision of war. And
then also of the disse^tyons in the cause or matter of our holy religion and
Christian faith and that in this cause of religion the opinions and minds of
either parties emonge them selves might be hard / vnderstonded and pondered in
presence of the said par^ies after a charitable fashon with coldness and
sobernes on both sides to be used to the end that tho things which in the
scriptures have been otherwise then ryghtly handled and vnderst^nd by either
perties being se^ aparte and corrected: the matter might be ended co^powned and
reduced to one simple v^ritie and Christian concord / so that from hence
forth one sincere and true religion might be of us maynteined and kept / that
like as we be / and do war under one Christ: so we might also live in one
christian Church in unity and concord.

For as much also as we the within subscribed Coruestour or Electour / and
Princes with other to us conjoined / as well as the other Electours princes / and
estates were summoned to the aforsayde parliamente or assemble / because we
would obediently fulfill your imperial commandment: we came with all speed
and maturitie to the aforsayde City of Augusta / and (which we would no man
should judge to be spoken for bostinge of our selves) we were there with the
first.

For as much therefore as your Imperial majesty about the very beginning of
this assemble and parliament / did cause it to be propowned and moved to the
Coruestours princes and and other estates of thempyre that all the states of
thempyre by the virtue of your proclamatyon and decree ought to exhibete ane
offer up their opinion and sentence in the vulgar and Latin tongue. And after
deliberation had the next wednesday / again answer was made to your Imperial
majesty that we for our part would the next friday exhibet the articles of
our confession. Therefore in obeyinge your majesty's will and pleasure / we here
present unto you in this cause of religion the confession or our preachers and
of our selves / in which it shall be openly sent / what manner of doctrine out of
the holy scriptures and the pure word of god / they have hitherto in our
lands / Dukedoms / lordeshypes and cities taught / and have treated in our
churches or congregations.

That if also the other Electours princes and estates of thempyre with like
wrytynges in the latin and vulgar tongue according to your motion and
propownynge will bring forth their opinions in this cause of religion: we here
offer our selves ready before your majesty as before our most mercyful lord
with the forsayde princes and our friends louyngly to commune and entreat of
tolerable means and ways / to the intent that (so much as honestly may be
done) we may agree together and the matter being peasibly debated without
odious contention betwixt us the parties (god willing) the dissension may be
ended / and reduced to one true concordaunt religion: as we al be / and do
war under ou^ Christ / according to the tenor of your proclamation / and
that all things may be brought to a godly truth / which thing we desire
of god with most fervent requests. But if as much as atteyneth to the other
Coruestours princes and estates which be on the other side: this entreatye of
the matter in such sort as your majesty has wisely judged it to be handled
and entreated / that is to wy^e / with such mutual presentation of wrytynges
and peasible conferring together / shall nac proceed and go forward / nor be
done with any fruit and profete: here we do openly and solempnely testifye by
this our writing left behind us / that we refuse no manner thing which may
by any means help to the obteyninge and winning of the Christian concord /
such as may stand with gods law and good conscience / as both your
imperial majesty / and the other Coruestours and estates of thempyre / and
finally all which be holden with a sincere love and zele toward the Christian
religion / which shall hear this matter with indifferency: shall by this our
confession know and understand.

For as much also as your imperial majesty to the Coruestours princes and
the other estates of the empire not ones but oftentimes has louynly sygnifyed /
and in the parlyament holden at Spira which was in the year of our lord.1526.
according to the form of your imperyall instructyon and co^missyon caused it
to be recyted and openly read / that your majesty in these busynes of relygion
for certain causes there alleged i^ your majesty's name / would not determine
nor could not conclude any thing / but that according to thoffyce of your
majesty ye would diligently labor the matter with the byshope of Rome that a
general council might be gathered / as the same thing was more largely
declared more then a year paste in the last common assemble holden at Spira /
where your imperial majesty by the lord Ferdinande king of Boemie and of
Hungary our friend and loving lord and afterward by your orator and
commissaries / caused this among other things to be purposed and declared /
that your emperial majesty had vnderstonded and expended the delyberatyon and
counsel of your Lieutenaunt in thempyre and of the president and counselors
in your Regyment and of the inbassadours sent from the other estates which
assembled together at Ratispone / concerning a general counsel to be
gathered. And that your Imperial majesty did also judge it to be profitable
that a council should be gathered. And that because the matters which were
then treated betwixt your imperial majesty and the byshope of Rome drew
nyghe to a concord and Christian reconcilement: your majesty doubted not but
that the bishop of Rome might be brought in mind to have a general
council. wherefore your imperial majesty signified unto us that ye would
labor that the aforsayde byshope should consent together with your majesty to
gather such a general council and with all expedition to send out letters
publyshynge the same: The^ if in this cause of religion the dissensyons betwixt
us and the parties be not louyngly and charitably pacifyed and ended (which
thing may chance) we here before your imperial majesty with all obedience do
offer our selves (which thing is more then is required of us) to appear and
to make answer our selves in such general free and Christian council / of
which to be gathered in all themperiall assembles and parliamentes which have
been holde^ and kept in the time and years of your imperial majesty / it
has been always entreated and with full assent and agreeable voices
concluded. Unto the which also general council and also unto your imperial
majesty before these time in this most high and most grave cause we have
after due manner and form of law provoked and appeled. To which appellatio^
unto your imperial majesty and unto the said council / we yet do cleave and
stycke fast / neither we do intend or can go from it by this or by any other
treatise / onles the cause betwixt us and the parties according to the tenor
of the last imperial citation be louyngly and charitably pacifyed ended and
reduced to a Christian concord. Of which we here also solempnely and openly
proteste.

The principal artycles of the faith.
1. Of the Trinite.
OUr Churches with full consent do teach that the decree of Nicene council
touching the unity of the Godhede or divine essencie and of the.iii. parsons
is true and ought to be believed without any doutynge / that is to say / that
there is one de^tie or divine essencie which is both called and is in deed God
/ everlasting without body without parts / unmeasurable i^ power wisdom and
goodness / the maker and preserver of all things as well visible as invisible and
yet be.iii. distinete parsons of all one godhede or essencie and of all one
power and which be coeternall / that is to say the father son and holy
ghost. And this word (parson) they use in the same signifycation that other
doctors of the church have in this matter used it / so that it signifies not a
part or quality in an other / but yt which has a proper being of it self.

Heresies
They dampne all heresies of the^ that impugn this article / as ye Manichees
who did put two pryncyples or begynnynges one good and an other badde / also
the Ualentinians the Arrians the Eunomians the Mahometistes and all such
other. They da^pne also the Samosatens both old and new which where as they
contend that there is but one only parson / they dispute of the word (which
we call the second parson) and of the holy ghost craftily and wyckedly saying
that they be not distinct persons but that the word (which we as I said do
call the second parson) signifies a word pronounced with the voice / and the
ghost or spirit signifies a mouynge which is created in things.

2. Of original sin
Also they teach that after the fall of Adam all men which be issued and
deryued according to nature / be borne with sin (that is to wit) without
fear of god without trust or affiaunce in god / and with a concupiscence or
lust / and that this disease or sore or vice original is in deed sin which
dampneth and brings eue^ now also everlasting death to them which be not
borne new again through baptism and the holy ghost.

They dampne the Pelagians and other which deny that this vice original is
sin / Heresies
and (to the utter defacynge and abbrydgi^ge the glory of the merits and
benifytes of Christ) they dispute that man of his own natural powers without
the holy ghost may satisfye the law and be pronounced and declared right wise
in the sight of god for the honest warkes of reason.

3. Of the humanity and divinity of Christ.
Also they teach that the word (that is to say) the son of god did take
man's nature in the womb of the blessed virgyne Marie / so that there be two
natures / a divine nature and an humane nature in unity of parson inseperably
conjoined and knytte / one Christ / truly god / and truly man / borne of the
virgyne Marie / truly sufferinge his passion / crucified / dead / and buried /
to thentent to bring us again into favor with the father almighty / and to
then^e^^ to be a sacrifyce and host not only for Original sins / but also for
all actual sins of men. The same Christ went down to the helles / and truly
rose again the third day / and then ascended to the heuens / that he should
there sy^^e at the right hand of the father and perpetually ^eygne and have
dominion over all creatures / and sanctifye them which believe in him /
sendynge the holy ghost into their hearts / who governs comfort and
quyckeneth them and defends them against the devil and power of sin. The
same Christ shall openly return again / to thentent to judge as well the
quick as the deed. etc^. according to the Creed of the Apostles.

4. Of iustifycation.
Also they teach that men can not be made ryghtuous in the sight of God by
their own proper powers merits or works / but yt they be freely justified
for Christ's sake through faith / when they believe that they be taken again
into favor and that their sins be forgyuen for Christ's sake / who with his
death has satisfied for our sins. This faith god repute^h and takes instead of ryghtwysnes before him. As Paul teaches in the third and fourth
chapiters to the Romans.

5. Of the obteini^ge of faith.
To the obteynynge of this faith / was ordained the ministry of teaching the
gospel and gyuinge the sacraments. For by the word and by the sacraments as
by instruments is given the holy ghost who works faith where and when it
pleases god in them which hear the gospel (that is to wit) that god not for
our own merits but for Christ iustifyeth those which believe that they be
received into favor and grace for Christ's sake.

They dampne the Anabaptists and other which think that the holy ghost cu^meth
to men without any e^terne or outward work / Heresies
by there own preparations and works.

Also they teach that this faith ought to bri^ge forth good fruits and that
men ought to do good warkes commanded by god / 6. Of good works.
because of gods will and pleasure / but not that we should trust that by
tho works we deserve to be justified in the sight of god. For the forgyuenes
of sins and justification is purchased by faith / as testifyeth also Christ
which says. When ye have done al these things / yet say / we be vnprofyta^le
servants. The same thing the old writers of the church do teach. For. S
Ambrose says. Saint. Ambrose
Hoc constitutum est a deo, vt qui credit in Christum saluus sit, sine opere*
so la fide, gratis accipiens remissionem peccatorum. That is to say. That is
ordained and instituted of god that who believes in christ / is saved without
work / only by faith freely receyuynge forgyuenes of sins.

7. Of the holy church.
Also they teach that one holy Church shall continually remain. The church
is a congregation of holy persons in which congregation or company the Gospel
is ryghtly taught and the sacraments ryghtly ministered. And to the true unity
of the church it is enough to consent of the doctrine of the gospel and
ministration of the sacraments Neither is it requisite that in every place be
like humane traditions / rytes or ceremonies ordained and instituted by men. As
Paul says / one faith / one baptyme one God and father of all. etc^.

8. Of the ministers of the Church
All though the church properly be a congregation of holy parsons and of true
beleuers / yet nevertheless sithe in this life many hypocrites and evil
parsones be myxt among the good: it is lawefull to use the sacraments which
be ministered by euel men according to the sainge of Christ The scribes and
phariseis sit in the chair of Moses. etc^. And the Sacraments and word
because of thordinaunce and commandment of Christ be effectual not
withstanding they be ministered by evil parsons.

Heresies
They dampne the Donatistes and such like which denied it to be lawful for us
to use the ministry of evil men in the church / and which thought that the
minysterie of evil men was unprofitable and of none effect.

9. Of baptyme.
Of baptyme they teach that it is necessary to salvation / and that by
baptyme is offered the grace of god and that children are to be baptized which
by baptyme being offered to god be received into the favor and grace of god.
Heresies
They da^pne the Anabaptystes which disalowe the baptyme of Children / and say
that children be saved without baptysme.

10. Of the sacrament of the Altar.
Of the souper of the lord they teach that the body and blood of Christ be
verily present and he distributed to the eaters i^ the souper or mau^dy of the
lord and dysproue them that teach other wise.

11. Of confession.
Of confession they teach that private absolution in churches ought to be
retained and kept although in confession the rehersall of all the sines be
not necessary. For it is impossible according to the psalmist. Delicta quis
intelligit? who understands his sins?

12. Of penance ^^ repe^tau^ce
Of penance they teach that they which after baptysme be fallen again into
sin may be forgyuen of their sins what time so ever they turn and
repent. And that the church to such which return to repentance ought to
give the benefyte of absolution. And penance stands properly in these two
parts / that is to say / in contrition which is a fear driven in to the
conscience after that sin is espied. And in faith which is conceived by the
gospel or absolution and which believes that for Christ's sake the sins be
forgeuen and comfort the conscience and delyueteth it from terrors and
fears. After that must follow good works which be the fruits of penance.

They dampne the Anabaptists which deny that they which be ones justified
may lose the holy ghost. Heresies
Also those which contend that to some men so great perfection do chance i^
this life / that they can not sin. They da^pne also the Nouar^ans which
would not assoyle those that were fallen after baptyme and came again to
repentance. They reiecte and disalowe also those which teach not that
remission of sins is given by faith but that it cummeth by our own love and
works. They be also disallowed and rejected which teach that the Canonical
satisfactions be necessary to redeem everlasting pains or pains of
purgatory.

13. Of the use of the sacraments.
Of the use of the sacraments they teach that the sacraments be ordained and
instituted not only that they should be cognysauncies / badges or marks by
which Christyan men are discerned and known from other people But rather
that they should be signs and testymonyes of the will of god toward us / to
stir up and to conferme faith in us which use them so propowned. Wherefore
we must so use the sacraments that faith be added and put unto them / to
thentent we may believe the promyses which be exhibyted and showed by the
sacraments.

Errors.
They dampne therefore those which teach that sacraments even by their own
proper virtue do iustifye and which teach not that faith is required in the
using of the sacraments / which faith may believe that sins be forgiven

14. Of order ecclesiastike.
Of the Ecclesiastical order they teach that no man ought openly to teach in
the church or congregatyon / or mynistre the sacraments / onles he be duly
and lawefully there unto called and appointed.

15. Of rytes or vsages of the church.
Of the rytes of the church they teach that such rytes ought to be kept which
may be kept without syn and which be profitable to a tranquillity and good
order in the church as certain holy days / feastfull days and like / yet
nevertheless of such rytes and ceremonies men be admonyshed lest their
consciencies be combred / as though such ceremonies be necessary to
salvation. They be also admonyshed that man's traditions ordained to pacifye god
/ to deserve grace / and to satisfye for sins be contrary to the gospel and
doctrine of faith. Wherefore vows and traditions of meats and so forth
ordained to purchase grace and to satisfye for sins be unprofitable and
against the gospel.

16. Of politic or civil matters.
Of politik or civil things they teach that lawful ordinauncies for a
publyke weal be the good works of god / and that it is lawful for Christian
men to bear officies and authorities / to exercise judgments / to judge
things according to themperours laws or other present laws of kings and
rulers / to execute due punyshmentes by the law / to hold batel or war by
the law / to be a soudiour / to co^tracte or bargayn by the law / to hold a
thing in propriety to take an oath / when officers do lawefully require it /
to mary a wife to take an husband.

Heresies.
They condemn the Anabaptists which inhibite / and forbydde these civil
offices to christen men. They da^pne also those which do not put the
perfection of the gospel in the dread of god and faith / but in leaving
forsakynge or gyuynge over of polytike and civil offices. For the gospel
teaches the eternal rightwisnes of the heart. So that it destroys not the
politic and civil governance / but chiefly requires the conservation of the
same / as good ordenau^ces of god and to exercise and practice charity in
such ordenaunces. Therefore necessariely Christen men ought to obey their
governors and their laws / save when they command sin / for then they be
rather bounden to obey god tha^ man / as it is said i^ the fyfte chap. of the
Acts

17. Of the ressurection.
Also they teach that Christ shall appear i^ the end of the world to judge /
and shall raise up again all that be dead / and shall give to the godly and
elect people everlasting life / and perpetual joys / but the wicked men and
deuilles ^e shall conde^pne to be tormented with out end.

Heresies
They da^pne the Anabaptists which think that the pain of evil men / and of
deuylles shall have an end. They dampne also other / which now a days do
sow abroad iuda^cal opinions yt before the Resurrection of the dead the
wicked shall be oppressed in every place / and the good men shall occupy and
possess the kingdom of ye world.

18. Of free will.
Of fre will they teach that man's will has some liberty to work civil and
outward rightwysnes / and to chose out things subject unto reason / but it
has not might without the holy ghost to do the ryghtwisnes of god / or
spiritual ryghtuousnes. ^or a man left to the power of his own soul (who^
Paul calls animalem hominem) perceyueth not the things that be of the
spirit of god but this ryghtwisnes is framed and made in the hearts / when the
holy ghost is conceived by the word. This says Austyne with like words i^
his third book of hypognosticon. The words of S Austine.
We grant (says S. Austyne) that every man having reasonable judgment has
free will not that he is able in things perteyning to god without god / either
to begin or at the least way / to make an end / but only in the warkes of
this present life / aswele good as evil. In good warkes (I say) which do issue
forth of the goodness of nature / as to will to labor in the field / to will to
eat and drink / to will to have a friend to will to have clothi^ge / to will to
make a house / to will to marye a wife / to noryshe beasts / to learn a
craft of diverse good things / to will whatsoever good thing apperteyneth to
this present life / of the which things none has being without the
governance of god / yea of him / and by hi^ they be / and began to be. Evil
works (I say) as to will to honor an Image or Idolle / to do manslaughter.
and c^.

Heresies
They dampne the Pelagians and other which teach that without the holy ghost
/ only by strength of nature / we may love god above all things / and do the
precepts of god / as touching the substance of the acts (as they call it).
For though nature can some what do the outward works (for nature may keep
her hand from killinge of me^) yet she ca^ not work the inward motyons / as
the dread of god / the trust in god / chastity / patience. etc^.

^
Of the cause of syn they teach / that although god does create and conserve
nature / yet the cau^^ of sin is the will of them that be evil / that is to
say / of the devil and of the wicked men / which will (when god helps not)
turns it self from god as Christ says in the eight chap. of John^ when he
speaks a lie / he speaks of hi^ self.

20. Of good works.
Our techers be falsely accused that they prohibit / and forbid good works.
For their writings which go abroad / of the.x. commandments / and other of
like matter do witness / that they have taught profytably of all kinds of
lyuinge and offices / as what kinds of lyuinge and what works do please god /
in every calling. Of which things prechers heretofore spoke but little only
they magnifyed and did set forth chyldishe / and unnecessary warkes / as
certain holy days / certain fastinges / fraternities / guyldes or
brotherhedes / pylgrymages / worshippynges of saints / rosaries / entringe
into relygion / and such other like. Our adversaries through our monition do
now unlearn / and leave this gere / so that they preach not these
unprofitable works so much as they did before. Furthermore they begin to
make mention of faith / of the which now this great while / has been
marvelous silence / all though they cease not to obscure and darken the
doctrine of faith / in that they leave men's consciences in a doubt bydding
the^ purchase remission of sins with warkes. But they teach not / that
through Christ / by only faith we may be sure to have remyssyon of sin.
For as much therefore / as the doctrine of faith (which ought to be the
chiefeste and principal in the church) has lain so long unknown (as we
must all needs confess that of the ryghtuousnes of faith / most deep and
profounde silence has been in preachinges / and that allouly the doctrine of
works has been exercised and co^uersau^t in churches) therefore (I say) our
teachers have warned and monished the churches of faith / in this wise as
follows / first that our works can not reconcile god unto us / or deserve
remyssyon of sins and grace / and iustifycation but this we get only by
faith / beleuynge that only for Christ's sake / we be received into favor /
who only is set forth / and purposed unto us a mediator and a mercy stock
by who^ the father is reconciled / and his favor gotten again. Therefore he
that trusts to deserve favor / or grace / with works: despyseth the merit
and grace of Christ / and seeks a way and cummynge to God with man's power /
without Christ / where as Christ said of himself. I am the way / the truth
/ and the life. This doctrine of faith is every where treated in Paul as to
the Ephesians. 2. by grace ye are made sa^e / through faith / and that not of your
self it is the gift of god / not of works. etc^. But here lest peradventure
a man would make cauillations / and craftily lay for him self against us that
we have devised and found out this new interpretatyon of Paul / I say that
all this cause or matter has for the mayntenance of it the authority and
witness of old and aunciente fathers. Austyne*
For S. Austyne in many volumes defends grace / and righteousness of faith /
against merits of works. And S. Ambrose does teach like things in the book
entitled of the calling of the ge^tilles / and other. For in the book of the
calling of the gentilles / he says in this wise. Ambrose
The redemptyon of the blood of Christ were but vile / and little wroth /
neither the prerogatyue of man's works should give place to the mercy of god
/ if ryghtuousnes which is made by grace were due to the merytes goinge before
/ so that it should not be the gift of the gyuer / but the reward of the
worker.

But now although this doctrine is contempned / and little set by / of the^
that be ignorant and lack knowledge: yet good and fearful conscyences do
know by experyence how confortable it is / for conscyences can not be made
quiet and at rest by any works but allonly by faith and that is when they be
assured and decre for a certayntie / that through Christ god is appeased /
like as Paul teaches. To. 5. sayng When we be made ryghtuous by faith / we be
at peace with god. All this doctrine is to be referred to the conflicte or
battle of a troubled conscience / and without this conflycte it can not be
well understand / wherefore men without knowledge / and which be unlearned in
the scriptures do judge a mysse of this matter / which dream that christian
ryghtuousnes is nothing else but civil and philosophical ryghtuousnes. In
times passed consciences were vexed with the doctrine of works / but they
hard not the conforte out of the gospel. Some their conscience draw out in^o
wyldernes / into Monasteries / and places of religion / trusting that there
they should merit and get grace / with solitary and monastical life. And
diverse men found out diverse works / to win grace / and to make
satisfactyon for their sins. Wherefore it was greatly needful / to teach and
to renew this doctrine of faith in Christ / lest fearful consciences should
lack comfort / and yt they might learn / that grace / remission of sin /
and iustifycation / may be atteyned through faith in Christ: Also men be
monished and warned that here the name of faith does not signifye only the
knowledge of the historye / such as is the faith in wicked men and deuylles /
but does sygnifye the faith that believes not only the history / but also /
the effect of the historye / that is to say / this article remyssion of sins
/ I mean (to speak more planly) that thorough Christ / by Christ's merytes /
and for Christ's sake / we may have grace / ryghtuousnes / and remission of
sins.

The sygnification of faith
Now he yt knows / that through Christ he has the father merciful and
favorable to hi^ / he truly knows god / he knows that god is careful for
hi^ / he loves god / and calls upon him / and (shortly to conclude) he is
not without god / as the Gentilles be / for deuylles and wicked men ca^ not
believe this article remission of sins. Therefore they hate god / as an enemy /
they call not upon him / they look for no goodness of him. Austyne.
Austyne also does warn the reader of the name of faith / after like manner
and teaches that this word (faith) in scripture is taken not for knowledge /
such as is in wicked men / but for trust which does comfort and raise up
fearful and trembling minds.

Faith after S. Ambrose
Furthermore our me^ teach that it is necessary to do good works: not that we
should trust to deserve grace by them / but because it is the will of god /
that we should do them. Remission of sins: and peace of conscience / is taken
allouly by faith. And because the holy ghost is taken through faith /
therefore forthwith hearts are renewed / and endued with new affectyons / so
that they may bring forth good works / for so says Ambrose / that faith is
the mother and brynger forth and getter of good will / and of just and
ryghtuous doing. For man's power without the holy ghost is full of wicked
affections / and more weak and feeble then that it can do works that be good
before god. More over it is under the dominion of the devil which drives me^
violently to diverse si^nes / to wicked opinions / to manifest and open crimes
as we may see in philosophers / which although they endeavored the^ selves to
live honestly / yet they could not bring it to pass / but were contaminate
and polluted with many open crimes. Such is the imbecilitie and feebleness of man
/ when he is without faith and the holy ghost / and governs hi^ self
allouly with his own strength. By this it is open enough that this doctrine is
not to be accused / as prohibitynge good works / but much rather to be lauded
and praised as showing unto us how we may do good works / for without faith
the nature of man can in no wise do the works of the first and of the second
precepte / without faith a man makes not invocation to god / he looks for
nothing of god / be bears not the cross / but seeks for ma^s help /
trustinge in man's help. So in the heart reygneth all manner of lusts and
desyers / and humane counselles / when faith is a way / and trust toward
god / wherefore Christ / also said that without me ye can nothing do. John^.
15. and the church syngeth without thy influence nothing is in man / nothing
is vngyltye.

21. Of honorynge of saints.
Of honorynge of saints they teach that the memory or rememberaunce of
saints may be purposed or set forth / to thentente that we may follow their
faith / and their good works / according to our vocatyon and calling / as
the Emperor may follow the ensample of Dauyd in holding battle to drive a
way the Turk from his cou^tray / for either of them is a king but scripture
teaches not to call upon saints or to ask help of saints / for scripture
sets forth unto us Christ allone / as a mean / a pacifyer / or a Byshope /
and an Intercessour he is to be prayed unto / and he has promised that he will
hear our prayers / and he chiefly allows this honor that is to say / that he
be called upon in all afflyctions. 1. John^. 3. if any man syn / we have an
advocate with god / and so forth. This is all most the some of the doctrine
with us in which (as every man may see) there is nothing that varyeth from
scripture / or from the catholyke and universal church / or from the church
of Rome / so far forth as it is known of writers. The which thing sithe it
is thus / these fellows judge ungently / and cruelly / which require our men to
be had / reputed / and taken / for heretykes. There is no dissensyon but about
certain abuses which have crope^ in^o the churches without sure auctorytie. In
y^ which also if there should be any dissimilitude / yet it might beseme
bishops to be of such le^ite and myldues / that for this confession / which
we have now rehearsed they would suffer our men. For the very Canons them
selves be not so hard ne so strayt to require the self same vsages and rites
to be every where. Nor there was never in any time like rytes in all churches /
all though with us the old rytes for the most part are dyligently observed and
kept. For it is a false and a slanderous report that all ceremonies / all
old institutyons / ordenaunces / and customs be utterly set a side in our
churches. But a common complaynte there was that certain abuses did stycke and
hang in the vulgar and accustomed rytes These because they could not with
good conscience be allowed and approved / they be some what corrected.

The artycles in which are rehearsed certain abuses changed.
Sithe the Churches with us in no article of the faith dissente from the
catholyke Church / allouly they omytte a certain few abuses / which be new
/ and against the will and intent in the Canons by process of time (which
gathers much vice) received / we desyer and pray the Emperors majesty
that he will favorably hear / both what thing is changed / and also what
were the causes / why / and wherefore the people is not compelled to observe
those abuses against there conscience / and that the Emperors majesty will
give no credence to these fellows which sow among the people wonderful
slanders only to inflame and kendle hatred of me^ against our preachers. By
these means provoking the minds of good me^ / they gave occasyon of this
dissentyon in the beginning / and by the same craft they be about now to
increase debate / and make more dyscorde. For the Emperors majesty shall
undoubtedly find the form both of doctrine / and also of ceremonies to be
more tolerable with us / then the wicked and evil wylled men do describe i^ to
be. Certes / the truth of the matter can neither be gathered of the rumors and
ianglinge of the vulgar people / nor yet of the evil reportinges of our
enemies / But this may sone be judged that nothing helps more to conserve
the dignity and worthiness of ceremonies / and to noryshe reverence / and
godlynes in the people / then if ceremonies be duly and accordyngly done in
the churches.

Of the sacrament of the Alter to be receyuid in both kinds / of all men and
women.
Both kinds of the sacrament are given to lay men in the souper of the Lord
/ for this usage has for it self the commandment of the Lord in the.26.
of Math (drink of this all) / where Christ commands manifestly / that al
should drink of the cup. And lest any man might make cauillacion / and say
that this partayned and belo^ged only to prestes: Paul to the Corinthians
recyteth an example in which it appears that the hole congregatyon did use
both kinds / and this custom remained long in the church / neither it is
surely known when or by whose authority / it was changed. Cyprian
Cypryan in certain places does witness / that the blood was given to the
people / Hierome.
the same thing Hierome does wytnes saying / the prestes do serve and
minister the body / and diuyde the blood of Christ to the people / Gelasius
ye Gelasius the bishop of Rome commands that the sacrament be not divided
/ Distinc. 2. de consecratione. capt. comperimus. Only the custom not very
ancient is other wise. But certain it is that a custom brought up against
the commandments of god is not to be allowed / as the Canons do wytnes.
Distinc. 8. capi. veritate / with other that follows / but this custom is
received not allouly against scripture / but also against the old Canons /
and the example of the Church / wherefore if any had rather use both kinds of
the sacraments they ought not to be compelled to do other wise with offense of
their conscience And because the dyuisyon of the sacrament agrees not with the
ordinance of Christ we do omit and leave the procession which was
accustomed to be observed here tofore.

Of the marriage of prestes.
Every man complained of theramples of Prestes / which lived not chaste and
continently. For which cause also Pius the bishop of Rome is reported to have
said / that their we^e certain causes why marriage was taken away from
prestes. The saying of Pius byshope of Rome.
But much more greater causes there be wherefore it ought to be restored unto
the^ again. For so writes Platina / Sith therefore the prestes with us were
desy^rous to avoid those open sclau^ders / they married wives / and taught
that it was lawful for them to contracte matrimonye and to mary. First
because Paul says. Propter fornication^ vnusquisque suam v^orem habeat. 1.
Cor. 7
That is to say. Let every man have his wife to avoid fornycatyon. Also it
is better to be married / then to be burned. Mat. 19
Secondarely Christ says. Non omnes capiunt verbum hoc. That is to say. Not
al do take this word / where he teaches that not all men be apt to live sole
/ and unmarried / for god did create a man to procreation as it appears in the
first of Genes. Gene. 1.
And it lies not in man's power / without a singlar gift and work of god to
change the creatyon of god. Therefore they that be not apt to live sole / and
unmarried / ought to contracte matrimony and to marie / for no man's law / no
vow can take away the commandment and ordinance of god. For these causes
the prestes do teach / that it is lawful for them to marie wives. It is
evidently known also that in the beginning of the Church prestes were married
men. In the beginning of the church Prestes were married.
For Paul says that he that is a married man / is to be chosen bishop. And in
Germany first of all other places / the prestes were violently constrained
(some what more tha^.CCCC. years agoo) to live without wives / and unmarried /
which truly did withsto^de it so greatly / that when the Archebyshoppe of
Mognus was about to publishe the byshopes of Romes bulle of that matter / he
was all most oppressed of the angry prestes crieng out upon him. And the
thing was handled so v^cut^esly and vngentily / that not allonly marriages were
inhybited to be made in time after wards to come but also the marriages made
already were disseuered and broken against all rygh^ and law both of god and
man / yea against the self canons made not allonly of bishops of Rome / but
of most laudable councels. And for asmoch (as the world now drawing toward an
end) the nature of man is by little and little made more weak and feeble: it is
convenient to provide before hand / that mo vices crepe not into Germany.
Undoutedly god did ordeyne marriage to be a remedy for man's infirmity. And
the Canons the^ selves do say / that the old rigor ought other whiles in the
later times to be released and made more slack because of the imbecilitie and
weakness of men. which thing is to be wyshed that it were done here in this
ma^er. And it should seem that Churches shall at length lack their true
pastors / if marriage should any longer be prohibited. But when the
commandment of god is open / when the custom of the Church is known /
when the unclean lyuinge without wives brings forth so many sclau^ders / and
occasions of evil / so many adulteries and other crimes worthy to be looked upon
/ and ponyshed of a good governor / yet it is a marvelous thing that in
nothing more cruelty is exercised then against the marriage of prestes God
commands to honor marriage / laws in all come^ wealths well ordered / yea
with the hethen men have furnyshed and adourned matrymonie with most high
honors. But now men shall lose their lives / yea and that prestes against the
mind of the canon laws / for none other cause but for marriage. 1. Ti. 4.
Paul calls it the doctrine of deuylles / which prohibiteth matrimony. This
thing to be true may be easily perceived now when the prohibition of marriage
is defended with such punyshmentes. But now as no man's law can take away the
commandment of god: so no vow can take away the commandment of god. The
words of Ciprian.
Therefore Cypria^ also persuades that women be married which keep not their
chastytie promised / these be his words / in the first book / the.11. epistle
/ if either they will not / or else they can not persevere and abide still / it is
better that they be married then that they fall into the fire with their deynti^s
/ at the least way / that they give none occasyon of evil to their brethern
and sustern. And the canon laws them selves do use a certain equity and show
favor toward them which before they be of sufficient age have vowed / as
comenly it has been accustomed to be done ontyl these day.

Of the Mass.
OUr churches be falsely accused that they utterly destroy / and take away the
Mass for the Mass is retained and hold still with us / and is celebrate with
high reverence. Also the usual and customable ceremonies all most all / are
observed and kept saving that among the laten songs be mixed here and there
Germane so^ges / which be added to teach the people. For ceremonies serve to
teach the inexpert and rude people / and that the intreatinge or handlinge of
the word of god may stir up some men to the true fear / faith and
prayer. And not allonly Paul commands to use in the Church a tongue which
the people do perceive and understand / but also it is so constitute and
ordained by man's law.

The people be accustomed to use the sacrament together / if any be apt thereto
/ and that also does augment and increase the reverence and the religion of
publik ceremonies / for none be admitted and allowed to receive the sacrament /
but such as be examined before. They be also monyshed and warned of the
dignity and use of the sacrament how great comfort it brings to fearful
and tremblinge consciences / to the^^ent that they may learn to believe: and
give credence to god / and to look for a^ things that good is of god / and to
ask all thing that good is of god. This honor deliteth god / such use of the
sacrament does noryshe love and reverence toward god / therefore it appears
not that the Masses be done more religiously with our adversaries the^ with us.
It is undoubtedly and evidently known also that this has been a come^ and a
very grievous complaynte of all good men a long season / that the Masses have
been shamefully abused and applied to lucre / and every man sees how wide
this abuse does appear in all temples and of what manner of men Masses be so^ge
and said allonly for reward or stipende ho^e many against the inhibi^ion of
the Canons do celebrate. But Paul grievously thretneth them which entreat and
receive the sac^ame^t unworthily / when he says. who ea^eth this bread / or
drynketh the cup of the lord v^wor^hely shall be gilty of the body and blood
o^ ^he lord. Ther^ore when prestes were monished with us of that syn: priua^e
Masses ceased with us because almost no private Masses were done / but for
lucre and advantage / And the bishops did know of these abuses well enough
/ which if they had corrected them in time / there should have been now less
dissentio^ then there is. Before by reason of their dissimula^ion and nothing
willing to here and se what was amysse / they suffered many vices to creape
in^o the church. Now they begin over late to complain of the calamities and
miseries of the church / where as in deed all this busynes and ruffelinge took
occasion of none other thing then of those abuses / which were so manifest
that they could be suffered no longer / There be now great dissentions risen
as touching the Mass / and the sacrament. And paraduenture the world is
punished for so long profaning and abusinge of Masses / which these byshopes
have suffered so many hundred years in the churches / and yet both might and
also ought to have amended them / for it is written in the book of the ten
commandments of god called the Decalogie / that he that abuses the name of
God shall not be unpunished. But sith the world began nothing that ever god
ordained has been so abused and turned to fylthy lucre as it appears that
the Mass has been. There was added and put to an opinion which increased
private Masses above measure / that is to say / that Christ with his passion
did satisfye and make amends for origynall sin / and did institute and
ordeyne the Mass that in it should be made an oblation for quotidian and
daily sins both mortal and venial. Of this did spring forth a comen
opinion that the Mass is a work that takes away the sins of the quycke /
and of the dead / by virtue of the work wrought. Then they began to dispute
/ whether one Mass said for many were as much worth as if for every man
were said a several Mass. This dysputation brought forth and caused this
infinite multitude of Masses. Of these opinions our prechers and learned men
gave warninge that they did vary and dissente from holy scripture / and did
hurt and diminyshe the glory of the passion of Christ / for the passon of
Christ was an oblation and a satisfactyon not only for the sin of birth
(called origynall syn) but also for all other sins / as it is written to the
Ebrues / we are sanctified by the oblatyon of Jesus Christ ones for ever / Also
/ he made perfect the sanctified without oblation for ever. Also the scripture
teaches us to be justified before god by faith in Christ when we believe that
our sins be forgyuen us for Christ. Now if the Mass does take away the
sins of the quick and of the dead even of the own proper virtue: then
iustifycation does chance and come of the work of Masses / and not of faith.
Which thing scripture does not suffer / but Christ commands to do it in
rememberaunce of him. Wherefore the Mass was institute to thentente that faith
in them that use the sacrament should remember what benefytes it takes by
Christ and so should raise up / and comfort the trembling and fearful
consciences. For to remember Christ is to remember the benefytes of Christ and
to feel / perceive / and think that truly / and in very deed they be exhibited
and given unto us / Nether is it enough to remember the history / for this
may also Jews and wicked men remember. Wherefore the Mass is to be done for
this intent that the sacrament may be reached forth and ministered unto those
that have need of comfort / as Ambrose says. Saint Ambro.
Quia semper pecco, semper debeo accipere medicinam. That is to say / because
I always syn / I ought always to take medycine. Now for as much as the
Mass is such a co^municatio^ of the sacrament: one common Mass is kept with
us every holy day / and also other days / if any desyer to use the sacrament /
it is given unto them that asks it. And this manner is not new in the Church
/ For the old fathers before Gregory speaks nothing of the pryuate Mass /
but of the common Mass they speak very much. Chrysostom.
Chrysostom says that the priest sto^deth daily at the alter / and some he
does call to the receyuynge of the sacrament or communion / and some he does
keep away. And it appears by the old canons that some one preeste did
celebrate the Masse^ / and of him all the other prestes and deacons received the
body of the lord / for so sound the words of the Canon of Nicene which be
these. Accipiant diaconi secundum ordinem post presby^eros ab episcopo vel a
presbytero sacram co^^onem. That is to say / let Deacons orderly after the
priests receive the holy sacrament or communion of the byshope or of the
priest. And Paul speaking of the communion commands that one should tarry
for another that there may be made a common participation.

For as much tha^ as the Mass with us has for it self the example of the
Church taken out of scripture / and of fa^hers: we trust it can not be
improued namely sithe the common and publyke ceremonies for the most part are
kept like to the usual and accustomed ceremonies / only the number of masses
is unlike / which for great and manifest abuses / it were profitable / at the
lest way to moderate. For in times passed mass was not done every day / no not
in great congregatyons / and where much people assembled together / as the
history tripertite does witness in the.ix. book the.xxxviij. chapter / in
this wise. Again i^ Alexandria scriptures be read upon the wednesdaye / and
the friday / and doctors do expoune them and al things are done without the
solemn manner of the oblation.

Of confession.
COnfession i^ the churches with us / is not done away / for the body of the
Lord is not wont to be delivered to any / but only to those that be examined
/ and assoyled before / and the people be very diligently taught of the faith
and assurance of absolution / of which before this time was little mention or
spekyng The people be taught to have the absolution in great price / because
it is the voice of god / and pronounced by the commandment of god. The power
of the keys is greatly made of / by showing how great comfort it brings
to troubled consciences / and that god requires faith to the end that we should
give credence to that absolution / as to a voice soundinge from heaven / and
that faith in Christ gets truly and receives remission of sins. Before
we did this: satisfactions were over much set up and magnifyed / but no
speaking there was of faith / and of the merit of Christ / and of
ryghtuousnes of faith. Wherefore in this behalf our churches be not to be
blamed. For our adversaries be also compelled to grant this to us / that the
doctrine of penance is entreated handled and opened of our learned men most
diligently.

But of confession they teach / that the rehearsal and nombryng of sins is
not necessary and that consciences be not to be charged with care to number and
teken up all defaltes / for it is impossible to rehearse all defaltes / as the
prophet records saying / who understands all defaltes or sines? Hieremie
also says. ^
Prauum est cor hominis et inscrutabile. The har^e of man is froward and can
not be searched. That if no sins should be forgyuen but those that ^e
rehearsed / consciences could^ never be quiet for many sins they nether espy
nor can ^^^ember. Also old writers do wytnes tha^ the nombrynge is not
necessary / (...) in the de^rees / Chrysostom is rehearsed which says thus. ^
Non tibi dico vt te prodas in publicum neque apud alios te accuses* sed
obedire te volo propheta (...) Reuela ante deum viam tua^. E^go t^a c^^fitere
p^^cata apud deu^ v^^u^ iudicem cu^ oratione. Delicta tua pronu^cta non lingua
sed co^scie^tiae tuae me ^orta. etc. I say not to the that thou show thy self
op^nly / nor that thou accuse thy self to other. But I will that thou obey
the Prophe^e saying Disclose thy way before god. Wherefore confess thy sins
to god the true judge / with prayer and pronounce thine offenses / not with thy
tongue but with memory of thy conscience. etc^. The Gloss.
And the gloss of penance / distine. 5. capi consideret does confess that
confession is of man's law / but yet confession / both for the great
benefyte of absolutyon / and also for other vtilities and profettes of
conscience / is retained and kept stylle among us.

Of diversities of meats.
IT was a comen persuasion not only of the vulgar people / but also of the
teachers in the Churches that diversities of meats and like traditions of me^
be profitable warkes to deserve remissyon of syn and of pain. And that the
world did so think / it appears by that / that new ceremonies / new orders
/ new holy days / and new fastings / were daily instituted / and teachers
in temples / did exact and require these works as a necessary honor to the
obteynynge of righteousness / and they greatly did put in fear the sely
consciences if they should omit and leave undone any of these things. Of this
persuasion of traditions / many myschiefes and inconueniencies ensued in the
church. First of all / the doctrine of grace and the ryghtuousnes of faith
was obscured and defaced / which is the chief part of the gospel / and ought
most of all to stand forth and to appear in the church / to the entente that
the merit of Christ might be well known / and that faith / which believes that
sins be forgyuen for Christ / and not for any of our works / might be
aduau^ced and set up far above works. Wherefore Paul also leans greatly
to this part / and remoueth and puts away the law and traditions of men
because he would show that the christian righteousness is an other thing then
such works / that is to wit / that it is faith / which believes that sins
be freely forgiven for Christ. But this doctrine of Paul is almost all
together oppressed by traditions / which have engendered and brought forth an
opinion that we must neades merit and get remission of sins and
justification by diversity of meats / and like honorynge of god. In penance
there was no speaking of faith / only these satisfactory works were purposed
and set forth / the hole penance appeared to consyste and stand in them.
Secundarely these tradityons have obscured and darkened the precepts of god /
because that traditions of men were preferred and regarded above the precepts
of god. The hole christianity was thought to be the obseruatyon and kepinge of
certain feries / rytes / fastinges / and vestures. These observations had by
long prescription of time won them selves a very high and an honest title.
for they only were called the spiritual life / and perfect life. But in the
mean season the precepts of god executed according to a man's vocation and
calling had no laud nor praise / as that the father and good man of the house
brought up his children / that the mother chylded / that the prince governed
the comen welthe / these things were thought to be worldly works and
imperfect / and far worse then those shyninge and glitteringe observations.
And this error did greatly vex and grieve well disposed consciencies / which
were sorry that they were holden in an imperfect kind and state of lyuinge /
as in marriage / in governance and in other offices and civil ministrations.
On the other side they magnifyed and had in high reputation the Monks and
such like cloisterers which call them selves religious parsons / and thought
(though untruly) that their observations did a great dele more deserve
remission of sins and iustifycation / than the simple life of a christian man
did. Thirdly / traditions brought great parell and danger to consciences /
for it was impossible to keep al traditions / and yet men judged these
observations to be necessary worshyppynges and honoryng of god. Gerson writes
that many did fall into desperation / Gerson
and that some also did kill them selves / for because they thought that they
could not satisfye the traditions / and in the mean season / they hard no
comfort of the ryghtuousnes of faith and of grace. We see makers of Sums and
divines to abridge and gather traditions and to seek Epikees that is to say
moderations or favorable interpretations t^ the^tent to ease consciences / and
yet they bring not their purpose sufficiently to pass / but some times they
snare and tangle consciences more and more. And in gatheri^ge together of
traditions / scoles and sermones have been so occupied that they have not had
leiser once to touch scripture and to seek the more profitable doctrine of
faith / of the cross / of hope / of the worthiness of civil or politik things
/ of comfort of conscience in most bitter temptations. Therefore Gerson and
certain other divines have grievously complained that they were so combred and
entangled with these paynfull traditions that they could not occupy them
selves in a better kind of doctrine And Austine does inhibite to charge
consciences with such observations / Austine
and full wisely does admonish and warn January his friend that he should
know that they be to be observed and kept indifferently / for this is his
term. Wherefore men ought not to think that our learned men have touched this
matter without cause why / or for hatred of bishops / as some men falsely do
think. There was great necessity to warn the churches of these errors /
which were spronge out of traditions amysse vnderstonden. For the gospel
compels to promote and set forth in the churches the doctrine of grace
and the ryghtuousnes of faith / which nevertheless can not be vnderstonded /
if men do think that they do merit remission of sins / and justification by
observations of their own electyon.

Mat. 15
Therefore they taught on this wise / that by observation and keeping of man's
traditions we can not get remission of sins and iustifycation / and therefore
it is not to be thought that such observations be necessary honors of god /
They add authorities of scripture / Christ accuses the apostels (which
kept not the customable and used tradition / which nevertheless seemed to be a
thing not unlawful / but a mean thing / and to have a certain affinity or
neyberhode with the baptismes and was^hinges of the law / and says. They
honor me in vain with commandments of men. Ergo he requires not an
unprofitable honor. And a little after he adds / all thing that enters into
the mouth does not inquinate nor de^yle man / Paul also to the Roma. Mat. 1^^
says / the kingdom of god is not meat nor drink. To. 13.
Also to the Collette no man judge you / Col. 2.
in meat / drink / sabbo^ day / Col. 2.
or holy day / Also a little after he says / if ye be dead with Christ /
from the elements of the world / why as though ye were lyuinge in the world
/ do ye keep decrees? touch thou not taste thou not / handle thou not. Peter
also in the acts says / why do ye tempte god / layeng a yoke upon the necks
of the disciples / Act. 15.
which neither we nor our fathers were able to bear / but we believe to be
saved as well as they / by the grace of our lord Jesus Christ. Here Peter
forbyddith to charge consciences with many rites and ceremonies either of
Moses or else of others. 1. Ti. 4.
And i^ the first epistle to Timothe Paul calls prohibition of meats the
doctrine of deuilles. for it is against the gospel to institute or do such
works / that by them we may merit and get remission of sins and
ryghtuousnes or that christianite could not be without such an honoring of
god. The objections of the adversaries.
Here our adversaries obiecte and lay against us that our men do prohibit
discipline and mortification of the flesh. as Iouinian did. but the contrary
shall be known by the writing of our learned men. for they have always taught
of the cross / that it behooves Christian men to suffer tribulacions or
afflictions For this is the true the earneste and the unfeigned mortificacio^ (I
mean) to be exercised with diverse afflictions / and to be crucified with
Christ. Moreover they teache y^ every christian man ought so to exercise and
subdue him self with corporal exercises and labors that saturitie and fulness
of metes and drinks / or slothfulnes do not provoke and pryck him forward to
sin. but not that we can deserve by these exercises remission of sin or
pardon of eternal death. And it behouith to set forth this corporal
discipline at all times and not alonly at a few certain days ordained to the
same purpose as Christ co^mau^dith Cauet^ ne corda vestra grauentur crapula.1.
Luc. 21.
beware that your hertes be not grieved with surfaiting / Also Hoc genus
demoniorum non eiicitur nisi oratione et ieiunio.1. Mat. 17
this kind of diuelles is not cast forth but with fasting and prayer. and
Paul says Castigo corpus meum et in seruitutem redigo.1. 1. Cor. 9
I chastise my body and bring it into servitude and bondage where he shewyth
clearly y^ ^e did chastise his body not to deserve by that discipline remission
of syn / but to have his body in bondage and apt to spiritual things and to
do his calling Therefore the fastinges the^ selves are not co^de^pned. but the
traditions which prescribe and appointe certain days / certain meats with
pe^yl of conscience / as though those manner of works were necessary
honouringes of god. Yet many traditions be kept with us / which help to this
that things be done orderly in the Church / as the order of the lessons in
the Mass and the chief holidays be kept still. But in the mean season men be
warned that such an honor does not justify or make rightuous before god ne
that there is no sin to be put in such things if they be omitted and left
undone without sclaunder or offending of any man. This liberte in man's rites
and traditions was not unknown to the old fathers. For in the East parts
they kept easter in another time of the year then they do at Rome / And when
the Romans accused the Easterlingis of scisme and division for this
dissimlitude and diversity / they were warned of other / that it is not
necessary that such manners be like every where. And an old father called
Ireneus says that the diversity and dissona^ce of fasting brekith not the
unite and co^sonau^ce of faith. Ireneus.
Like as in.12. distinc^ Gregory bishop of Rome signifies that such a
dissimilitude. Grego.
hurtith not the church / And in the history Tripartite / the.9. book many
e^amples of unlike rites ar gathered. Historia Tripartita.
And these words are recited / The mind of thapostles / was not to make laws
of holy days / but to prech good conversation and god lines.

Of the vows of monastical or religious persons.
IF a man would call to remembrance what was ye state of Abbeys or
Monasteries / how many things were done daily in the self Monasteries
contrary to the cano^ical laws: he shall the better perceive and understand
what is taught with us of the monastical vows. In S. Austines time the abbeyes
or monasteries were free Colleges or co^panyes to enter and depart at will.
Afterward when godly conversation was corrupt / vows were added euerywhere
even as it were a bond or prison devised for restitution of godly conversation
and discipline. Many other obseruaunces beside vows were added by process of
time. And these bondis were cast upon the necks of many before laufull and
conueniente age / contrary to the canonical laws. Many fell into this kind
of living through error / which though they were of sufficient age / yet
they could not judge their own strength and power. they that were so trapped
were compelled to abide stille / yea though the canons were so benificiall to
them that they might have be^ delivered. And this happened also more in
Monasteries of women tha^ of men / not withstonding that the weak sex or
kind ought more to have been spared. This rigor and straytnes displeasid many
good men before this time which saw maids and young men to be thruste down
i^to Monasteries for a liui^g. They saw how vnhapely that purpose did prosper
/ what sclaunders it brought forth / what snares it cast upon consciences /
They were sorry that the auctorite of the law Canon was utterly neglected and
despised in a thing most peryllous To these euilles was added such a
persuasion of vows / wherewith / yea the Monks and religious me^ them selfs
(as is well known) have been in time past discontente / if any were any thing
more wise or of better wit and judgment then other / they taught (I say)
vows to be egall with baptism / and that they by that kind of living
deserved remission of sins and righteousness before god / yea they added that
the Monkishe life not only deserved rightuosnes before god / but also a more
and a greater thing because it kept not only the precepts / but also the
counselles of the gospel. Thus they made men beleve that the profession of
such religion was far better then baptism / and that the Monkysshe life was
more meritorious then the life of rulers / yea tha^ the life of pastors and of
such like / whihe served their vocation and calling in the commandment of
god / without feigned and cloked religions. None of these things can be denied
for they be apparent in their own books* what was after don i^ Mo^asteries In
old time they were scoles of holy scripture and of other disciplines which
are profitable to the church / and from thens were taken pastors and byshopes.
Now it is another thing. It needs not to rehearse things known. In old time
they came together to learn / now they feign that it is a kind of living
ordened to deserve forgiveness of sins and iustificacion / yea they preach
that it is a state of perfection / and they prefer it far above all other
kinds of living ordained of god. We have rehearsed these things laynge on
odiously nothing more than truth / to thente^t that the doctrine of our men
might be the better vndrrsta^de concerning this matter. First of those that
contracte matrimony / thus they teach with us / that it is lawful to all men
which are not mete to live unmarried / to cuntracte matrimony / for vows can
not take away the ordinance and commaundeme^te of god. Of the vow of single
life.
But this is the commandment of god / that every man have his wife for the
auoydau^ce of fornicacion. 1. Cor. 7
Nor the commandment only / but also the creacion and ordinance of god /
co^pelleth them to mary which without the singular warke of god / be not
excepted / according to that text. Gene. 2
It is not good to a man to be allone / therefore they do not commit any syn /
which obey this commandment and ordenau^ce of god. What can be objected
against these things? let men extolle thobligacio^ and bond of the vow as
much as them lust / yet they shall not bring to pass / that the vow may
take away the commandment of god. The very Canon laws teach that the
auctorite and right of the superior is excepted in every vow. Wherefore much
less these vows be any thing worth / sith they be against the commandment
of god. Also if the bond of vow should (as they say) have no causes wherefore
it might be changed: the bishops of Rome would na^ have dispensed therewith /
for it is not lauful for man to disanulle a bond / which is al together of the
law of god. But so hit is that the bysshoppes of Rome have prudently judged an
equity and a favorable interpretacion to be had in this obligacion and bond /
and therefore we read that they have dispensed many times with vows. The
history of the king of Aragon which was darreyned and called again from the
monastery / is known well enough. and examples of our time ben apparaunt and
open. Moreover wherefore do our adversaries amplify and extolle the bond or
theffec^e of the vow / and make so myche busynes about it / when in the mean
season of the self nature of the vow they speak not one word / how it
ought to be in a thing possible / and how it ought to be wyllyngly / freely /
and with deliberation conceived? What things be required in every laufull vow.
But how perpetual chastity is in the power of man / it is not unknown. And
how few be there which do freely and deliberatly vow? Mayde^s and young men
before they can judge be persuaded and entysed to vow / yea and sometimes also
they be constrained. Wherefore it is not egally done to dispute so streyghtly of
the bond / when all men will grant that thing to be against the nature of a
vow / which is not freely / but suddenly and rasshely taken. Many canone laws
do adnulle vows made before the age of.xv. years / for before that age there
appears not to be so much judgment in a person to determine upon a
perpetual life. Another Canon granting yet more liberty to ye weakness of
man adds mo years / inhybityng a vow to be made before the age of.xviii.
years. But whether of them so ever we follow / certes the most part has a
very lawful and just excuse / why they should forsake their monasteries /
because they vowed before those ages. Finally yea although the violacion and
breakyng of the vow could be reproved: yet it shall not forthwith follow that
the marriages of such persons as have against their vow married ought to be
dissolved and broken. The auctorite of saint Austine
For saint Augustine denies that they ought to be broken.27.9.1. capt.
Nuptiarum. Whose auctorite is not light I although other men afterward thought
other ways. But though gods commandment of marriage may be thought to
deliver many from their vows: Note this reason.
yet our men bring also another reason concerning vows / that they be
frustrate and vain / for every honoring of god ordained and chosen of men
without the commandment of god to deserve remission of sin and
justification is wicked as Christ says. Mat. 15
They honor me in vain with commandments of men. And Paul teaches every
where that ryghtuousnes is not to be sought of thobseruations and honors
devised by men / but that it co^mith by faith to them that believe that they
have god pacified and merciful through Christ / and not for any our merits.
But clear hit is that monks and freers have taught that these feigned and made
religious deserve remission of sins and justification and that they make
amends for sins. I pray you what thing else is this / but to detracte and
pluck away from the glory of Christ / and to darken yea and to deny the
ryghtuousnes of feythe? Ergo yt folowith of necess^^e that these accustomed and
usual vows be wicked honourynges of god / wherefore they be vain and of none
effect. For y^ vow which is wicked and against the commandment of god is
nothing worth / for no vow ought to be a bond of wyckednes / as the Canon it
selue says. Gal. 5.
Paul says ye be avoided from Christ / ye be fallen from grace / which be
justified in the law (that is to wit) they that think to deserve remission
of sins with their own warkes / and to please god / for their own
fulfillyng of the law / and which do not feel that for Christ they freely
take by feythe remission of sins given them by the mercy of god / and that
for Christ they please god: these lose Christ / for the trust due to Christ
and to the promise of god they remove away / and apply to warkes. Also they
plede against the wrath of god not Christ the mercy stock / but their own
warkes / so that the honor due to Christ they apply to their warkes. But it is
clear / that monks and religious persons teach this (I mean) that they
deserve remission of sins with their obseruacions / and that they have god
merciful unto them for this cause. Wherefore they teach men to trust in their
warkes and not in the propiciacion and mercyfulnes of Christ. This trust is
ungodly / wicked and contrary to the gospel / and in the judgment of god it
shall be found void / for our works may not be pleded against the wrath and
the judgment of god. The wrath of god is mitigated and swaged only when we
conceive and take by feythe the fre mercy promised through Christ. Therefore
they lose Christ / which put their trust not in Christ / but in their own
warkes Furthermore the Monks / freers and religious men did teach their kind
of living to be a state of perfection because they kept not alouly the
precepts / but also the counselles. This error is most repugnaunt to the
gospel / because they have feigned them selves so to have fulfilled the
commandments / that they no more also then they be bounden to. And out of
this has spronge an horrible error in that they feigned themselves to have
merits of supererogation / that is to say more then they were bounden to have.
These merits they have applied for other to be satisfactions for other men's
sins. These things if any man were disposed odiously to handle / how many
things might he rehearse of which even the religious persons ^hemselues be
now asshamed. Yt is no light sclaunder in the church to purpose and set
forth to the people any honourynge of god devised by men without the
commandment of god / and to teach that such an honor does justify men
and make them ryghtuous. For the ryghtuousnes of feythe i^ Christ which
chiefly ought to be taught i^ the church is thus obscured and darkened: whiles
these wonderful and angelical religions / as this feigned poverty / this
cloked humility / this hypocritical chastity be cast before the eyes of men.
Furthermore the precepts of god and the true honor of god be darkened /
obscured and defaced / when men do hear that only Monks / freers / chauo^s /
and nuns be in the state of perfection. For the very perfection of a christen
man is an other thing. The true perfection of a christian man.
It is earnestly to dread god / and again to conceive faith / and to trust
that we have god pacified and contented for Christ's sake / to ask of god /
and surely to look for help in all things that we have to do according to out
calling. And i^ the mean season to do good works outwardly / and to serve our
vocacion. In these things is the true perfection and true honor of god / and
not in the unmarried life / or in beggynge / or in vile and fylthy cotes. Also
the people conceive many noisome and perilous opinions of those false
praysinges of the Monkishe life. They hear chastity (for so these religious
persons ^al it) praised without measure / therefore the people do lead their
life in marriage with offense and grefe of conscience. They hear that only
beggars be perfect / therefore they keep possessions and occupy the world with
an inward remorse of conscience. They hear that it is a counsel of the
gospel not to avenge / therefore private persons hearing this be not affrayed
to avenge / for they hear that it is but a counsel and na^ a commandment.
Other there be which judge yt al rule and ciui^e offices be unmeet for christen
men / and as though they could not stand with good christian.ii. There be
read examples of men which forsakynge marriage / and forsakyng the
administration and rule of he com^n wealth have hid themselves in abbeyes or
monasteries / and this called they to fle out of the world / and ^o seek a
kind of living that should more please god. Nether did they see that god ought
to be served in those precep es which he him self did give / and teach / and
not in commandments devised by men. It is a good and a perfect kind of
living / which has the precepte of god for it It is necessary to admonish
and warn men of these thing. A new opinion in Gersons time.
And before this time / also Gerson rebukes the error of religious persons /
as touching perfe^^ion / and witnesses that to say the monkisshe or religious
life / to be a state of perfec^ion / was but a new found halydaye and a
strange saying even in his time. So many wicked opinions hang in vows / as
that they deserve remission of sins and justification / that they be the
christian perfection / that they keep the counselles and the commandments /
that they have super flui^e of good works. All these things sith they be
false and contrary to Christ's doctrine: make vows to be vain / and of none
effect.

Of the power of the church.
Great disputacions have been of the power of bisshoppes / i^ which many men
have confusely mengled together the power of the church / and the power of the
sword. Of this confusion great batailles / great unquietness have proceeded /
whiles bysshoppes b^arynge themselves bold upon the power of the keys / not
allouly have institute and begone new honors of god / and not only have
burdonned consciences with reservation of cases and with violente
exco^munications and cursings / but also have translated and remo^ed the
kingdoms of the world / and gone about to take away thempire from
themperours. Well disposed and learned men have reproved these vices in the
church long sythen. Therefore our preachers to thentente to conforte
consciences: were constrained to show the difference of the ecclesiastical
power / and of the power of the sword / and have taught that either of them
because of gods commandment is to be had in great reverence and honor /
as high benefits of god upon earth. The power of the ^eys what.
And thus our learned men think / this is their opinion / that the power of the
keys / or the power of bysshoppes according to the gospel / is a power or
commandment of god to preach the gospel / to remitte / and retain / lose /
and bind sins / and to ministre sacraments. For with that commandment
Christ sends forth his apostles / Io. 20.
saying as my father has sent me / even so I send you. Take the holy ghost
/ whose sins ye remitte they be remitted / and whose sins ye hold still
they be holden still. Also in the gospel of Mark he says. Go preach the
gospel to every creature. etc^. Mark xvi.
This power is put in execution only by teaching or preaching the gospel / and
by ministryng the sacraments either to a multitudees or else to one man by
him selue according to his vocation and calling / for here be granted not
corporal things / but eternal things / as eternal ryghtuousnes / the holy
ghost / eternal life. These things can not chance or come but by
ministration of the word and of the sacraments / as Paul says. Romans 1.
The gospel is the power of god to salvation unto all that believe therefore
sithe the power of the church grants eternal things and is exercised only
by ministration of the word: it lettith not civil administracion. Like as the
craft of singynge nothing lettith civil or political administration / for
political administration gothe about other things then does the gospel. For
the governor or ruler defends not minds / but bodies and bodily things
against manifest injuries / and restreyneth men with the sword and corporal
pains to thentente to keep civil justice and peace. Therefore the power of the
church and the civil power may not be mixed and confounded together. The
power of the church has his commandment to teach the gospel / and to
ministre the sacraments. Let it not break into another office / let it not
transla^e and altere the kingdoms of the world as the bishops of Rome have
done / let i^ not abrogate and defete laws of princes / let it not take away
due and laufull obedience of the subject to his prince / let it not interrupte
iudgemente^ of any civil ordenaunces or contractes / let it not prescribe ne
appointe laws to governors of the form and facion of the common welthe / as
Christ says. My kingdom is not of this world. Io. 1^.
Also in an other place he says. Luc. 12.
Quis me constituit iudicem aut diuisorem super vos. that is to say. Who made
me judge or deuider over you? And Paul says to the Philippia^s. Philip. 111.
2. Cor. x
Our policye or conversation is in heaven. And to the Corinthes. The armure or
wepons of our cheualry be not carnal / but mighty through god to destroy
cogitacio^s / and thoughts. etc^. After this sort do our men divide they
offices and duties of both these powers / and teach to honor them both /
and do acknowledge that each of them is a gift and benefit of god. If bishops
have any power of the sword / that power have they not as bysshoppes by the
commandment of the gospel / bu by man's law given to them of kings / and
emperors / to the civil ministration of their own goods. So that this is
another office tha^ is the ministratio^ of the gospel. Therefore when soever
question is made of the jurisdiction of byshopps / the empire / and temporal
power ought to be divided / and distincted from the ecclesiastical
jurisdiction. Undubtedly after the gospel / and after gods law no
jurisdiction belongs to bishops (that is to say) to them to whom is
committed the ministration of the word and of the sacraments / save only this
power to remitte and lose si^nes / and also to discern and judge doctrines /
and to reiecte a doctrine contrary to the gospel / and to exclude and shytte
out from the communion of the church wyckedmen / whose wickedness is known /
and this must be with the word / without man's violence. In these things
the congregations / or churches owe of duty / and be by the law of god bounden
to submit them selves and to show obedience / according to that saying of
Christ who hearith you hearith me. Luc. 10.
But when they teach or ordeyne any thing against the gospel: then the
congregations have a commandment of god prohibitynge obedience. As this
beware of false prophets / and Paul to the Galathians. Mat. 7
If an angel from heaven would preach or show any other gospel / accursed
be he. Gal. 1.
Also to the Corinthes / we can nothing do against the truth / but for the
truth. Also in another place he says / Power is given to us for edification
and not for destruction. 2. Cor. 13.
So also do the canon laws command. 2. D. 7. cap. Sacerdotes et cap. Oues.
And. Austine
S Austine against the epistle of Petilian says. If catholic by shoppes be
deceived any where by chance / and think any thing against the canonical
scriptures of god / we ought not to consent unto the^. If bishops have any
other power or jurisdiction as in cognisauns of plee or in determinynge of
certain causes / as of matrimony or of tithes: they have it by man's law /
wherein when the ordinaries fail to do their duties / because either they will
not / or can not / princes be compelled (yea whether they will or not) to see
the law ministered to their subjects for peace to be hodde amongst them. A
question.
Moreover it is disputed whether bishops / or pastors have right and auctorite
to ordeyne ceremonies in the church and to make laws of meats / of holy
days / and degrees of ministers or orders. etc. They that ymagin this
auctorite to be in bishops / allege and bring for them this testimony and
authority of scripture. Io. 16.
Yet I have many things to say to you / but ye can not yet bear them. but
when that spirit of verity shall come / he shall teach you all truth. They
allege also the example of the apostles which made a prohibition that the
people should absteyne from blood and suffocate. Act. 15.
They allege the Sabbat day changed into Sunday contrary to the book of
the.x. commandments called the Decalogie as it seems. Neither is there any
example more craked upon and bosted then is the changing of ^he Sabbat day.
Great / say they / is the power and authority of the church / sithe it
dispensed with one of the.x. commandments. But as touching this question our
men teach after this sort / The solution.
that bishops have no power to de^re and ordeyne any thing against the
gospel / as it is showed before. The canone laws teach the same thing.9.
distinc. But it is against scripture to make traditions / or to exact or
require them to be observed / for the^tent that by that observation we may get
pardon of sins / and may satisfy and make amends for sins. For thus the
glory of the merit of Christ is hurt and mynyshed / when we go about to
deserve remission of sins and justification with such observations. Now it
is openly known that traditions have grown almost to an infinite nombre in
the church by the means of that persuasion / and the doctrine of faith and
ryghtuousnes of faith in the mean while has been oppressed. For still more
holy days and more were made / and fast^^ngdayes were commanded / new
ceremonies / new honourynges of saints were institute. For the deuisers and
auctors of such things thought to get remission of sins ^ justification
with these works. So grew up the penitential canones in times passed / of
which yet we see certain tokens and steps in satisfactions. Also many
writers there be / A disceitful similitude.
which feign that in the new testament there must be an honourynge of god /
like as that which we read in Leuiticus / the ordering whereof god committed
to the apostles and bishops. And these writers seem to be deceived with
thexample of Moses law / as though the ryghtuousnes of the new testamente
were an outward observation of certain rites and ceremonies / like as the
justice of the old law was an outward observation of certain rytes.
Wherefore like as in the old law it was sin to eat swynes flesh. etc. So
in the new testament they put sin in meats / in days / in vesture / and
semblable things. And they think that the ryghtuousnes of the new testament
can not be with out these things. Of this occasion came those burdens / that
certain meats do defile and pollute the conscience / and that it is deadely
sin to omit and leave vnsayde canonical hours / that fastings deserve
remission of sins / and that they be necessary to the ryghtuousnes of the
new testament / that sin in a case reserved can not be forgyuen without
thauctorite of the reseruer / where as in very deed the canones them selves
speak only of the reservation of the canonical pain / and not of the
reservation of sin. From whens I pray you / and of whom have the bishops
their power and auctorite to lay these traditions upon the church to vex or
grieve their consciences? For every man may se open auctorities and clear
testimonies / which prohibit the making of such traditions either to
deserve remission of sins / or as necessary to the ryghtuousnes of the new
testament or to salvation. Col. 2.
First Paul to the Collossenses says / Let no man judge you in meat / drink
/ part of the holy day. etc. Also if ye be dead with Christ from the
elements of the world / why as living in the world do ye keep decrees /
touch not / taste not. etc. which be commandments and doctrines of men /
and have a presence and a color of wisdom. Also to Lite, Tit. 1.
he prohibiteth traditions apertlye / war^ynge that they be not attendynge to
the Iu^aicall ^a^es / and to commandments of men / which turn from the
truth. And Christ speaking of them that require traditions says in this wise
/ Let them alone / they are blind guydes of the blind / Mat 15.
and he improueth such honors / layinge / All plants / which the father of
heaven did not plant / shall be plucked up by the roots. It bishops have
authority to one-rate and lade churches with infinite traditions and to snare
the consciences / why does scripture so often prohibete to make / and to hear
traditions? why does it call them doctrines of deuyls? Did the holy ghost
warn those things before in vain? wherefore it must needs consequently ensue
/ that sith ordenaunces instituted as things necessary / or with an opinion to
deserve remission of sin / be contrary to the gospel: that it is not lauful
for any bishop to institute or require such honors. For it is necessary that
the doctrine of christen liberty be kept still in the churches / which is /
that the bondage of the law is not necessary to justification / as it is
written in the epistle to the Galathians. Gal. 5.
Be not subiec^e again to the yoke of bondage. The chief place of the gospel
must needs be kept still / which is / that we obtain remission of sins /
and justification freely by faith in Christ / and not for certain
observations or honors / devised by men.

what or denaunces bysshoppes may make:
What shall we think than of the Sunday and like rytes of the temples? To this
our learned men say / that it is laufull to bishops or to pastors to make
ordenaunces / that things be ordrelye done in the Church / not that we should
purchase by them remission of sins / or that we can satisfy for sins / or
that consciences be bound to judge them necessary honors / or to think that
they sin / wha^ without offense of other they break them. 1. Cor. 11.
So Paul does ordeyne that in the congregation women should cover their
heeddes / and that interpreters and teachers be herd after an order in the
church. It is convenient that the churched should keep such ordenaunces for
charity and tranquilite so far forth that one offends not another / that
all things be done in the churches in order / and without busynes and trouble^
but yet so yt the conscience be not charged / as to think that they be
necessary to salvation / or to judge that they sin when they break them
without hurtynge of other. As no man will say / that a woman does sin which
gothe forth abroad bare heded offending no body therewith* Even such is the
observation and keeping of the Sunday / of Easter / of Penthecoste / and like
holidays and rytes. For they that judge that by the auctorite of the church
the observing of the Sunday instead of the Sabbat day was ordained as a thing
necessary do greatly err. The sabbat day.
The scripture permits and grau^teth that the keeping of the Sabbat day is
now free / for it teaches that the ceremonies of Moses law after the
revelation and showing abroad of the gospel are not necessary. And yet
because it was needful to ordeyne a certain day / that the people might know
when they ought to come together: it apperethe that the Church did appoynte
the Sunday / which day (as it seems) pleased them rather than the Sabbat day
/ even for this cause / that men might have an example of christen liberty /
and might know that the keeping and thobseruation neither of the saturday / nor
of any other day is necessary. Prodigious / monstrous / and wonderful
disputations are set forth of the chaungynge of the law / of the ceremonies
of the new law / of the chaungynge of the Sabbat day / which all have
spronge forth of a false persuation and believe of men / which thought that
there must needs be in the church an honourynge of god / like to the
leuiticall / and that Christ committed to thapostles and to bishops
authority to inuente and to find out ceremonies / which be necessary to
salvation.

These errors crepte in to the Church / when the ryghtuousnes of faith was
not clearly enough taught. Some dispute that the keeping of the Sunday is not
merely and fully gods law / but in a manner / and as it were of the law of
god. They prescribe of holy days / how far forth it is laufull to work.
Such manner of disputations / what other things be they but snares of
consciences? For although they busy them selves to modefye / qualify / and
find an epikee in their tradiditions / temperynge the rygour of them with
favorable declarations: yet notwith^tandynge as long as the opinion that they
are necessary does remain (which must needs remain where ryghtuousnes of
faith / and christen liberty are not known.) this epikee equity and favor
can never be perceived ne known.

The traditions of Thapostels be not kept.
The Apostles commanded to absteyne from bloudde / who does now observe and
kep^ it? And yet they that do not keep it / sin not / for undoubtedly not the
apostles them selves would burden the conscience with such bondage / but they
prohited it for a time / for avoiding of sclaunder. For the perpetual will
and mind of the gospel is to be considered in a decree / Scase any canones
are kept diligentelye / and many daily go out of use and memory / yea with
them which defend traditions most diligently. Neither can the consciences be
helped ne provided for / onles this epikee or equity be kept / that is to
wit / that we know that canones / and decrees are to be kept without
opinion of necessity / and that consciences are not hurt / though traditions
be forgotten / and utterly set aside.

The intractablenes of bishops.
Certes bishops might easily keep still lauful obedience / if they would not
enforce men to keep traditions / which can not be kept with good conscience.
They command prestes to live unmarried / they receive none / onles they swear
in effect that they will not teach the pure doctrine of the gospel. The
congregations require not that bishops should repare and make concord again
with loss and decay of their honor / and yet it should become good pastors
so to do / but they only require / that they would release / and pardon unjust
burdones which are new / and received contrary to the custom of the catholyk
church. We will not deny but in the beginning some constitutions were
grounded upon reasonable and probable causes. Which yet are not now agreeable
ne convenient for the times ensuyng. It appears also that some were by e^rour
received. Wherefore it might apperteyne to the gentleness of bysshoppes / now to
mitigate and release them / sithe such m^^ation breaks not the unite of the
church. For many man's traditions in process of time have been changed / as
the ca^ones them selves do show. That if it can not be obtained / that those
obseruatio^s should be released / which can not be done without sin: Act. 3.
we must neades follow the rule of the apostles / which command rather to
obey god then men. 1. Pe. 5.
Peter forbids bishops to be lords / and emperors over the church. Now
/ it is not intended by us to take away jurisdiction from the bishops / but
this one thing is required of them / that they would suffer the gospel to be
purely taught / and that they would release a few certain obseruatio^s /
which can not be observed without sin. That if they will not remitte ne
release any thing / let them look to their charge / how they shall make
accomptes to god / in that they were occasion of this scisme and division / by
reason of their obstinacy and styffenes.

The conclusion of the book.
THese be the chiefest articles / which seem to be in controversy / and
debate. For all though of moo abuses it might have been spoken: yet because we
would not be tedious ne long / we meddled but with the most principal / of
which the rest may easily be judged. Great compleyntes there were of pardons
/ of pylgrymages / of the abuse of excommunication / paroch^es were many ways
vexed by stationaries. Infinite contentions and stryfes there were betwyxte
curates / and religious men / for the right of the paryshe / for confessions /
for buryalles / for extraordinary preachynges / and for other things
innumerable. We have let these gere pass / to thentent that the most
principal points of this matter shortly set forth / might be more easelye
known.

Neither is here any thing said or gathered to the reproach / sclau^der / or
hurt / of any man. Allonly those things have been rehearsed / which seemed
necessary to be spoken / to the end it might be perceived that nothing is
received in doctrine and ceremonies with us against scripture / or the
catholyke Church. For it is manifest and known that we most diligently take heed / lest any new or wicked opinions should creape in to our churches.

These articles before written / we thought best to be exhibited and put
forth / according to the commandment of Themperours majesty / in which
might appear our confession / and the sum and effect of their doctrine
might be seen / which be teachers and preachers among us. Now if in any
thing / this confession shall seem to be not perfect and sufficient / we be
ready (god wyllyng) according to the scriptures / to render and give a larger
information.

CVM PRIVILEGIO REGALI.

The Apology that is to say the defense of the confession of the Germaynes
made by Philip Melancthon, and translated by Richard Tauerner at the
commandment of his master, the right honorable master Thomas Crumwell chief
secretary to the kings hyghnes.

CVM PRIVILEGIO.

Philip Melancthon to the reder sends gretynge.
AFter that the confession of our princes was in open audience solempnely
read, certain divines and friars prepared a confutation of our writing,
which when the Emperors majesty had caused to be solempnely red in the
assemble of the princes, he required the^ to assent unto it. But our princes
hearing that many articles were there disproued which to renounce without
grudge of conscience they could not, demanded that a copy of the co^futacion
might be to them exhibited, to the intent that they might both see what their
adversaries condemned and also refute their reasons. And in such cause which
apperteyned to christen faith and instruction of the conscience, they thought
that the adversaries would not have made it strange to exhibit their writing.
But our rulers could in nowyse obtain it, onles they would have bound them
selves to most perelouse and vnegal co^dicions which they could not do
except they would cast them selves into a manifest danger. After this, there
was publyshed a pacification in which appeared that our hedes refused no
burdayne were it never so payneful so that it might be sustained without
offense of conscience. But the adversaries obstinatly required us to allow
certain manifest abuses and errors, which thing when we might not do, again
the emperors majesty required our princes to assent to the confutacyon which
to do our princes utterly refused. For how should they assent in a matter
touching the faith to the thing that they never red? And they herd that
certain articles were there condemned in which thing they could not allow
the judgment of the adversaries without offense. There were also certain
other which required me to make an Apology or defense of the co^fessyon in
which should be expouned unto the emperor the causes why we received not the
confutacyon and the things soluted which the adversaries objected. For there
were certain of us which when their confutacion was red noted the su^me of
their places and arguments. This Apology they offered at last unto the
emperors majesty to the intent that he might know that most grave and high
causes let us to allow their confutacyon. How be it the emperor received
not the book that was offered him. After this came forth a proclamacion, in
which our adversaries do triu^phe that they have confuted by scripture our
confession. Now therefore (o gentle reader) ye se our Apology in which ye
shall perceive aswele the judgment of our adversaries (for we have faithfully
reported it) as their condempnacyon of certain articles against the manifest
scripture of the holy ghost, so far be they wide from defetyng our opinions
by scriptures. But all be it that in the beginning I made only an Apology,
yet now in my setting it forth in prynt, I have added other things. And for
that purpose I have put to my name, because they should make no cauillacion
that the book was published without any author certain.

This always has been my custom in such controversies that (so much as I
might lawfully do) I would retain the form of the used and accustomed
doctrine, to the intent that we might the sooner agree together. Nor I do not
much unlike at this time, all be it I might justly wade further in dissuadynge
the people from the opinions of our adversaries. But our adversaries do so
handle their matter that they show them selves neither to seek truth nor
concord, but to sup up our blood. Doubtless I have now also written as soberly
and moderately as I can, but yet if any thing shall seem to be spoken over
sharply. I here protest that I contend with the divines and frears and not
with Caesar or the princes whom (as my duty is) I have in high estimacyon and
regard. But I saw lately their confutacion which I have marked to be written
so capciously and slanderously that in certain places they may dysceyue yea
the ware and cyrcumspecte readers. Natwithstandyng I have not medlyd with all
their cauilacyo^s (for that were an infinite work) but I have comprised the
chief matters, to the intent that among all nacyons a testimony of us may
appear, that our judgment is right and godly of the Euangel of Christ.
Discord pleases not us. Nor our own private peril does nothing move us
which how great it is by reason of the vehement hatredes of our adversaries
kyndled against us, we easily perceive. But we may not renounce the manifest
verity and necessary to the edificacion of the church. wherefore we think
that all incommodities and peryls are to be sustained and suffered for the
glory of Christ and profit of his church, trusting that God will allow and
accept this our office and endeavor, and moreover we hope that our posterity
and successors shall have of us here after a better opinion and a more
indifferent judgment. For it can not be denied but that many places of
Christ's doctrine, which are most necessary to be notified and known in the
church, be of us and ours opened and clearly set forth, which here to fore
with how great and perelouse opinions they were suppressed and hid through
deceitful friars, lawyers, and sophistical divines, it lusts me not here to
recite. we have the open testimonies of many good men which cease not to render
thanks to god for this most high benefit that now many right necessary
matters be better opened by us, than they were by our adversaries here tofore
taught or preached. wherefore we shall comme^de and committee our cause unto
Christ who shall another day judge these debates and controversies, whom we
also humbly beseech to cast his tender eyes, upon the afflicte and ruinous
churches and shortly to reduce them into a godly and perpetual concord. Amen.

The Apology or defense of the confession of the princes of Germany.
THe first article of our confession our adversaries do allow, in which we
expowne that we believe and teach one essencie divine indivisible. etc^. and
yet.iij distinct persons of the same essencie, divine, and coeternall, the
father son and holy ghost. This article always we have taught and defended.
And we know that it has certain and ferme testimonies in holy scriptures
which can not be avoided. And constantly we affirm that they which think
otherwise be out of the church, and ydolaters, and do most high dishonor
and slander to god.

Of original sin.
THe Second article, of Original sin the adversaries do approve, but so yet
that they disprove our definicion of original sin which we recited by the
way. Here forthwith even in the very frount of the matter the emperors
majesty shall espy that ye writers of the confutacyon lacked not only right
judgment but also indifferencye and gentylnes. For where as we of a si^ple
mind went about to recyte by the way the things that original si^ne
contained, they by their crooked and maliciouse interpretacion do craftily
deprave the sentence which of it self is true enough. For thus they argue.
To be without fear, ^ to be without ^aythe is actual sin, Ergo they deny
original sin.

It appears suffyciently that this subtyle argument was brought forth in
scoles, and not in the counsel of Caesar. But albeit that this cauillacion may
easily be avoided, yet that al good men may se that we teach none
inconuenyence in this behalf, we first require that our confession be hard
which diligently marked shall deliver us from the suspicion of strange
doctrine* for there is it written thus.

This is translated out of the Duche.
we do teach that after the fall of Adam, every man naturally borne, is
conceived in syn, and so is borne, that is, that they al from the womb of
their mother be inclyned unto evil which can not have by nature the fear of
god, nor no true faith in god.

This place witnesses that we pluck from them which be borne according to
the carnal nature not only acts but also the powers and gifts of performyng
dread and hope toward god. For we say that they which be thus borne have
concupiscence, nor can not perform the true fear and trust toward god.
what can be here reproved? Truly unto good men we judge that we be sufficiently
purged. For the latin description is of like sentence, detractyng from nature
the power that is to say the gifts and strength of perfourmyng fear and
trust toward god, detractyng also acts in persons of the age of dyscretion.
And when we name concupiscence, we understand not only acts or fruits, but a
perpetual inclinacyon of nature.

But here after we shall show with more words that our definition agrees with
the usual and ancient definition. For first we will open our intent why we
used these words in this place. Our adversaries them selves in scoles grant
that the material (as they call it) of original sin, is concupiscence.
wherefore concupiscence was not to be omytted in the definition namely in this
time when many do descant of it so ungodly.

For sum of them dispute that original syn is not any vice or corrupcion in the
nature of man, but only a bondage or a state of mortality which all the issue
of Adam do sustain without their own proper vice, for another man's gylte and
offense. More over they add that noman is dampened to eternal death for sin
original, and to this purpose they bring forth a similitude of the Civil
law saying tha^ like as of a bondewoman the issue is bond and sustain this
condycyon or state without the vice of nature, only for the calamytie of the
mother, so is it of Original sin. But we, to show that this wicked opinion
does displease us, have made mencyon of concupisce^ce, namyng it a sore and
disease, and expounding that man's nature is borne corrupt and viciouse.

Nor we have not only named it concupiscence, but have said that there does
lack also the fear of god and faith. which we have done, for this entente.
The scole doctors do diminyshe and make lyte the sin original* not
sufficiently understanding the definicion of original sin which they
recyued of the fathers. Of the noryshment or kyndlyng (which they call
fomit^m) they dispute, that it is a quality of the body and according to
their accustomed folly, they bring in question whether ye quality be caught by
contagion of the apple, or by the breathyng of the serpent. whether it be
increased by prouocacyons. with such sort of questions they oppress the
pryncipall matter. Thus when they speak of original sin, they omytte the
vices of man's nature which be more greuouse, as the ignorance of god, the
despysyng of god, the lack of fear, the lack of trust in god, the hatynge
of gods judgment, the fleyng of gods judgment, the being angrye with god,
the despair of grace, the trustyng in worldly socours. etc^. These dyseases
most repungnat to the law of god, the scolastycall doctors espy not. Yea
more over they attribute to man's nature hole power to love god above all
things, to do the precepts of god, quo ad substantiam actuu^, as they call it
that is to say as much as belongs to the substance of acts, nor they see
na^t that they speak things merely repungnat. for, to have power of a man's
propre strength to love god above all things, to do the commandments of
god, what other thing is this, than to have original justice? That if man's
nature have these so great powers that of it self it may love god above
althinges (as the scolemen do boldly affirm) what shall be original sin. what
shall we need the grace of Christ, if we may be saved by our own propre
justice? what shall we need the holy ghost if man's powers of them selves may
love god above al things and do his commandments? who sees not how
unright the judgment is of the adversaries? The lyter diseases of man's
nature they acknowledge, but the most greuouse they acknowledge not, of the
which yet the scripture does admonyshe us in diverse places and the prophets
do perpetually complain of, I mean of the carnal surenes, of the cotempte of
god, of the hate of god and se^blable vices engendered within us. But after that
the scolasticall doctors did entermixe with Christ's doctrine ye
philosophical descantyng of the perfection of nature and attributed more than
neded to frewyll and voluntary acts, and taught men to be justified before
god by a certain philosophical or civil justice (which we also confess to
be subject to reason and after a fashyon to be in our power) they could not
see ye inward uncleanness of man's nature. For it can not be judged but by the
word of god which the scole men for the most part in their disputacyons do
not touch. These were the causes why in the descripcion of original sin we
made mencyon of concupiscence and also detracted from the natural powers of
man the fear and trust toward god. For our intent was to declare that original
sin contained also these diseases ignorance of god / contempt of god /
voydaunce of fear and trust toward god / the impotencie of loving god. These
be the pryncypal vices of man's nature, disagreyng properly with the first
table of the Decalogie.

Nor it is no new matter that we have spoken. The old definicion ryghtly
understand sound to the same effect, when it says that original sin is
a lacking of original justice. But what is justice? Scolemen do here brable
of logical questions, but they expound not what is original justice.
Undoubtedly justice in scriptures conteyneth not only the second table of the
Decalogie, but the first also which commands the fear of god / the faith
in god, the love of god. So that justice original should have had not only an
egall temperame^t of the qualities of the body, but also these gifts / a
notice of god more certain / the fear of god / the affiau^ce in god / or at least a direction and power to do these things. And ye witnesses the
scripture wha^ it says, that man was create to the image and similitude of
god which is nothing else, but that to man this wisdom and justice was
naturally given with which he might compass and conceive god, and in which
god might be apparently noted and seen / this is to say, that to man were given
these gifts, the notice of god, the dread of god, the trust in god, and
such like. For thus does Ireneus interpret the similitude of god, and also
Ambrose which beside other things which he spoke for this purpose does
expressly gather in this wise. Non est ergo anima ad imaginem dei, in qua deus
non semper est. It is not then the soul that was made to the image of god, for
in it, god is not always. And Paul to the Ephesians and Colossenses show the
image of god to be the notice of god / justice and verity. And Longobardus is
not aferde to say that justice original is the very similitude of god, which
god gave to man* we recite the sentencies of the old fathers which do
nothing let saint Austins interpretacyon of the image.

wherefore the old definicion, that calls original sin the lack of
justice detracteth not only the obedience of the inferior powers of man, but
also detracteth the notice of god / the trust in god / the fear and love of
god, or at lest it detracteth the power of doing these. For the deuynes the^
selves in the scoles teach, that these be not done without a peculiar gift
and aid of grace. we do name the gifts expressly (that the thing may be
understand) the notice of god, the fear and trust toward god. By this it
appears that the old definicion does speak the same thing that we do.
detractyng or plucking away the fear of god and hope, that is to say, not only
actual deeds but also the gifts and might to do this.

The same sentence has the definicyon of Austyne, who uses to define
original sin to be concupiscence. For he means that when justice was
lost, concupiscence succeeded. For the decayed nature because it can not fear,
love, and trust god, it seeks and loves carnal things. The judgment of
god, this sick and corrupt nature either void of fear despyseth, or being
replenyshed with fear hates. Thus Austyne compriseth aswele the defaulte or
faylyng, as the viciouse quality which thereof ensues. Nor this co^cupisce^ce
is not only a corruption of the qualities of the body, but also an unright
turnyng to things carnal in ye superior powers. Nor they se not what they
say which do both attribute to man concupiscence not mortified of the holy
ghost, and also the love of god above althynges. we therefore have ryghtly
expressed both two in the description of original sin, that is to say,
those defautes, as not to be of power to believe god, not to be of power to
dread and love god. And also to have a concupiscence, which against the
word of god seeks carnalitie, that is to say seeks not only corporal
pleasures, but also carnal wisdom and justice and has confidence in worldly
goods contemnyng god. And not only the old but the late doctors namely that
be of any judgment do teach that original sin is as well the lackes or
defaultes which I have remembered, as concupiscence or lust. For thus says
saint Thomas. Peccatum originis habet priuatione^ originalis iusticie and cum
hoc inordinatam dispositionem partium anime, vnde non est priuatio pura, sed
quidam ^abitus corruptus. Original sin, says Thomas, has a priuacyon of
original justice and with it an inordinate disposicion of the parts of the
soul, so that it is not a pure priuacion, but rather a corrupt habit. And
Bonauenture writes thus. when it is demanded what is original sin, it may
be well answered that it is an immoderate concupiscence. It is well answered
also, that it is a lacking of the due justice. And in the one of these
answers is included the other. Hugo is of the same opinion which says,
original sin is an ignorance in the mind and a concupiscence in the flesh.
For he means that wha^ we be borne we bring with us an unknowing of god, a
mystruste, a diffidence, a contempt, a hatyng of god. For these things he
compriseth when he names ignorance. And these sentencyes be agreynge to
scriptures. For Paul otherwhyles expressly names the lack or defaulte, as in
the first to the Corinthes y^.2. chapitre. Animalis homo non percipit ea quae
spiritus dei sunt. A natural man perceyueth not the things that be of the
spirit of god. In another place he names concupisce^ce to be of power and
efficacitie in the me^bres, and to bring forth evil fruits. ^e could recite
more places for both parts, but a manifest thing needs no testimonies.
Undoubtedly a prudent reader may easyly judge that to be without fear and to
be without faith is even very actual sin. For they be perdurable defaultes
in a nature unrenewed.

wherefore our opinion of original sin does not vary from scripture nor from
the catholic church. we do nothing but repurge clarify and bring again
into light the most grave sentencies of scripture and of the fathers here to
fore obscured and hid by the sophistical questions of these late divines.
For the thing it self speaks that these new divines perceived not what the
fathers meante wha^ they spoke of default. Truly the knowledge of original
sin is right necessary. For the greatness of the grace of Christ can not be
otherwise understand, onles we first know our own infirmities. The hole
justice of man is mere hypocrisy before god, onles we acknowledge y^ our heart
naturally is void of love, of fear, of trust toward god. Therefore says
the prophet. After that ye haste showed it unto me. I struck my thyghe. Also,
I said in my trance every man is a liar, that is to say an untrue thynker
of god.

Here the adversaries do also reprove Luther because he wrote that original
sin remains after baptime. They add that this article was ryghtly
co^de^pned by Leo the tenthe. But the emperors majesty shall espy here a
manifest be spoken of ciuyle judgment, not of the judgment of god. They sow
unto them even as wisely this sentence / Nature is not evil / this spoken in
place is not repreueable but it may not be wrested to the diminishyng of
original sin, and yet these sentencies be red among scholemen, which out
of due season do mengle philosophy with the gospel. Nor these were not
disputed only in schools, but from the schools they were brought to the people.
And those persuasions raygned, and nourished the affiau^ce of humane powers and
oppressed the knowledge of the grace of Christ. wherefore Luther wyllyng to
declare the magnitude of original sin and of humane infirmity, taught that
the resydues or dregs of original sine be of the own nature in man not
indifferent things, but that we need the grace of god, that they may not be
imputed, and the holy ghost that it may be mortified. Albeit the scholemen do
make less, both the sin and the pain teaching that man of his own power
may do the commandments of god. In Genesis is otherwise described the pain
due for original sin. For there not only to death and other corporal
punyshementes man's nature is made subject, but also to the kingdom of the
devil. For there is given this horrible sentence. I will put enmities betwexte
the and the woman and betwexte thy sede and her sede. Defaute and concupysce^ce
be punyshementes and also sins. Death and other corporal euyls and the
tyranny of the devil be properly punyshementes. For man's nature is given into
bondage and holden captive of the devil which infecteth it with wicked
opinions and errors and impelleth it to al kinds of sin. But as the devil
can na^ be vaynquyshed without the aid of Christ* so can not we by our own
powers redeem our selves out of this bondage. The very history of the world
shows us how great is the power of the deuyls kingdom. The world is full
of blasphemies against god and of wicked opinions, and with these bonds the
devil has in captivity the wise and ryghtwyse men in the face of the world.
In other sum appear more gross vices. But when Christ is given unto us
which takes away these sins and these punyshmentes and destroys the
kingdom of the devil, sin and death: the benefytes of Christ can not be
known, onles we understand our own euyls. Therefore of these things our
preachers do diligently teach, and they teach not any new thing, but the
holy scripture and sentences of holy fathers. This we trust will satysfye the
Emperors majesty as touching y^ chyldyshe and cold cauillacions by which
the adversaries have sclaundered our article. For we know that we believe
ryghtly and with the catholyk church of Christ. But if the adversaries will
renew this contencyon there shall not lack learned men among us yt shall make
them answer and defend the truth. For the adversaries in this cause
understand not for the most part what they speak. Ofte^tymes they speak
things repugnant and they neither express ryghtly and dialectically the
formal cause of original sin nor the defaultes as they call them. But we
would not in this place over subtylly discuss their vain and sophistical
arguments. we thought it enough to recyte the mind of the holy fathers (who^
we do follow) with commune and known words.

The third article the adversaries allow, in which we confess two natures
in Christ that is to wit, the nature humane, assumpt of the word into the
unity of his person. And that the self same Christ suffered and dyed to the
intent to reconcyle unto us the father, and rose again to the intent to reygne
to justify, and to sanctify the beleuers. etc^. according to the Symbol of
the apostles and the Symbol of Nicene.

Of Iustificacyon.
IN the fourth, fythe, syxte, and also in the twenty article they condemn us
because we teach that men obtain remission of sins not for their own
merits but freely for Christ by faith in Christ. For they da^ne both two
points, first that we deny that men for their own merits do obtain
remission of sins, and seco^darily that we affirm that by faith is obtained
remission of sins and that men be justified by faith in Christ. But sithe
it is so that in this case or controversy the pryncypall point of our
religion is debated, which ryghtly understand sets forth the honor of
Christ, and brings a necessary and plenteous consolacyon to the godly
conscience: we desire yt the emperors majesty will hear us benyngly of these
so great matters. For the adversaries where as they neither understand what is
remission of sins neither what faith* neither what grace, nor what justice
is: pytyfully do defyle this point, obscuryng the glory and benefytes of
Christ, and bereue fron^ the godly consciencies y^ propouned co^solacio^s in
Christ. And to the end we may maynteyne our co^fessyon and assoyle the
objections of our adversaries: we shall first premitte certain things to the
end that the fountaynes of both our doctrines as well ours as the adversaries
may be known. The hole scripture ought to be distributed i^to these pryncipal
places, law, and promyses. For otherwhyles it shows the law, and otherwhyles
ye promise of Christ, as when it promyseth Christ to cum / and promises for
him remission of sins, iustificacyon and life eternal, or where in the
Euangell Christ after he ones appeared promyseth remission of sins,
iustificacyo^ and life eternal. we call the law in this disputacyon the
precepts of the Decalogie in what place so ever they be red in scripture. Of
the ceremonies and judicial laws of Moses at this time we speak nothing. Out
of these, the adversaries take the law, because man's reason after a fashyo^
does naturally understand the law. For it has still the same judgment
written by god i^ the mind, and by the law they seek remission of sins and
iustificacion. But the Decalogie requires not only outward civil works
which reason can after a fashyon fulfill, but also it requires other things
far above reason, as, truly to fear god, truly to love god, truly to call on
god, truly to believe that god hears us, and to look for the aid of god in
death and all afflictions, finally it requires obedience toward god in
afflictions and in death, that we escheue them not, nor grudge not at them
when god lay them on us. Here the scholemen following the phylosophiers only do
teach the justice of reason, as civil works, and they feign that reason
without the holy ghost may love god above al. For so long as man's mind is
idle, nor feleth not the ire or judgment of god, it may feyne that it will
love god, that it will do well for god. After this wise they teach that men
deserve remission of sins by doing that in them is, yt is to say, if reason
sorowyng for his syn, fetches out an elicite act (as they call it) of the
dilection of god, or works well for god. And these opinion because naturally
it flattereth men, has enge^dered and increased many ceremonies in the
church, vows of monastical living, abuses of the Mass, and every day more
and more sum or other have (through this opinion) invented new ceremonies and
rytes. And to nouryshe and encreace the trust in such works, they have
affyrmed that god necessaryly gives grace to such workers by necessity not
of coaction but of immutabilitie. In this opinion many great and pernicious
errors do stycke which to recount it were to long. Let the prudent reader
only ponder this, if this be the cristian ryghtwysenes, what diversity is
betwyxt philosophy and the doctrine of Christ? If we deserve remission of
sins by these elicite acts, what neded Christ or regeneracyon? And through
these opinions the thing is now run so far, that many do scorn us because
we teach that another justice is to be sought beside the philosophical
justice. we have herd some in the pulpyt setting apart the gospel preach
Aristotle's Morals. Nor they did not amys if it be true that the adversaries
defend. For Aristotle of the civil manners has written so excelle^tly that he
can not be amended. we se books put forth in which be conferred certain
saynges of Christ with the sayenges of Socrates, Zeno and of other, as though
Christ came for this purpose, to teach us certain laws by which we might
deserve remyssio^ of sins, and not receive it freely through his merits.
wherefore if we allow here ye doctrine of the adversaries that we deserve by
the works of reason remyssyon of sins and iustificacyon, there shall be then
no difference betwixt the justice of the philosophers or at least of the
pharisees and the Christian justice. And albeit the adversaries (because they
will not clean put Christ out of their books) require the knowledge of the
history of Christ and attrybute unto it y^ it does merit unto us acertayne
habit, or (as they them selves call it) the first grace, which they
understand to be an habit inclynynge us to love god the easylyar, yet very
little it is, that they attribute unto this habit, for they feign that the
acts of ^ylle is both before that habit and after, of al one sort. They
feign that the will may love god, but yet that habit styrreth it to do the same
more freely. And they bid us purchase this habit first by precedent merits,
and after they bid us purchase by the works of the law an increase of that
habit, and life everlasting. Thus they bury Christ that men should not use
him for a medyatour nor think that for him they receive freely remission. of
sins and reco^ciliacyon, but dream that by their own fulfyllyng of the law
they be reputed just before god, where as in deed the law is never satisfied,
sithe reason does nothing but certain civil works, and the whiles neither
fears god nor believes truly that god cares for him. And although they
speak of that habit, yet without the justice of faith the love of god can
neither be in men nor it can not be understand what it is. A distinctyon of
Duns.
And where as they feign a difference betwixt Meritum congrui, and Meritum
co^digni, they do but daly, because they would not seem openly to play the
Pelagia^s. For if god necessarily gives grace pro merito congrui, so is there
not Meritum condigni. Howbeit they wot not what they say. After the habit of
love obtained, they feign that man does merit de condigno. And yet they bid
us doubt whether we have that habit or no. How do they then know whether
they merit de congruo, or de co^digno? But all this thing is feigned of idle
fellows which know not how remission of sins is atteyned and how in the
judgment of god and in the affrayes of conscience, the trust of works is
plucked from us. Careless hypocrites always judge. that they merit de
condigno, whether they have that habit or not. For naturally men trust to
their own propre ryghtwysenes, but the affrayed and troubled conscience
wauereth and doubts and evermore seeks and hepeth up other works to the
entente it may be quye^. This troubeled conscience never feleth that it
meriteth De condigno, but runs in to despair, onles it hears beside the
doctrine of the law, the Euangell of free remission, and of the justice of
faith. Thus the adversaries teach nothing but the justice of reason, or at
least of the law, upon which they look, even as the Jews did upon the
covered face of Moses, and in these careless hypocrites which think them
selves to satisfye the law, they kyndle a presumpcyon and vain trust of
works and a co^tempte of the grace of Christ. On the contrary part, they
drive the fearful co^sciencies in to desperacion, which sithe they work with
doubtyng can have no experience of faith nor of the virtue thereof, thus at
last they utterly despair. But this is our opinion of the justice of reason,
that god requires it, and that for the commandment of god honest works are
necessarely to be done which the Decalogie commands, according to Paul's
saying, the law is a tutour. Also, the law is given to the ungodly. For god
will that the carnal persons be kept within the bounds by this discipline, and
to the mayntenaunce of this he has given laws, letters, doctrine, rulers,
punyshmentes. And this justice may reason after a manner perform of the own
proper powers, although ofte^tymes it is over ceptes of the second table
which conteyne cyuile justice which reason understands. And contented
herewith, they think that they satysfye the law of god. In the mean while
they se not the first table which commands us to love god, to believe
verily that god is dyspleased with sin, and truly to dread god, and to
think surely that god hereth us. But man's mind without the holy ghost either
retchlesly despyseth the judgment of god, or in pain fleethe and hates god
his judge. wherefore it obeys not the first table. when then in man's nature
stycketh the contempt of god, and the doubting of gods word and of his
threatenings and promyses: men in deed do syn, ye when they do honest works
without the holy gooste, because they do them with a wicked heart, according
to this saying of Paul. what so ever is not of faith is sin. For such do
work with contempt of god, like as Epicure thi^keth not that god cares for
him, regards him, or hears him. This contempt does mar al their good
works, for god judges the heart, Finally this is very unadvisedly written of
our adversaries that men gyltye of eternal punyshement deserve remyssyon of
sins by the act of love sithe it is not possible to love god, onles we
first purchase forgiveness of sins by faith, for it is ympossyble for an
heart which in deed felethe the ire of god, to love god before he perceive him
pacyfyed, I say so long as god fears us and seems to cast us from him into
eternal death, man's nature can not lift up it self to love the angrye judge
and punysher. It is easy for evil persons to feign these dreams of love,
that a mortal sinner may love god above all things, for they feel not what
is the ire or judgment of god. But in the trouble of conscience and in the
very conflycte, there the conscience prove how false their phylosophycal
conclusyons be. Paul says. The law workethe anger. he says not that by
the law men deserve remyssyon of sins, for the law always accuses the
conscience and put it in fear, Ergo it iustifyeth not, for the conscience
terrified by the law, flees the judgment of god, wherefore they err, that
trust to win remyssyon of sins be the works of the law. This suffyseth
of the justice of reason or law, which the adversaries teach, for here after
when we shall show our mind of the justice of faith* the matter it self shall
constrayne us to bring out more records, which may also help to destroy
the erroures of our adversaries here to fore aledged. Because therefore that men
can not by their own powers do the law of god, and because all be under sin
and condemned to everlasting death, for this cause we can not be delivered
from syn by the law nor be iustyfyed, but the promise of remissyon of sins
and of iustyfycatyon is given for Christ, who is given for us to satysfy for
the sins of the world and is set up as a medyator and a pourger of sins.
This promise has no condycyon annexed of our merits, but freely offers
forgyuenes of sins and iustyfycatyon, as Paul says. If by works, Ergo it
is no grace. And in an other plase. The justice of god is now declared without
the law that is, remyssyon of sins should hang on our merytes and the
reconciliation should be by the law, so it were unprofitable (for we can not do
the law) it should also ensue that the promise of reconcilement should never
chance unto us. Thus reasons Paul. Romans 4. If our enherytaunce should cum by
the law, void were our faith, and the promise were of none effect For if the
promise should require a condycyon annexed of our merytes and of the law (sith
we never fulfill the law) it should follow, that ye promise were unprofitable.
But sith it is so* that iustyfycatyon changes by free promise, it follows
that we can not iustyfye our selves. For otherwise what neded god to promise?
And where as the promise ca^ not be taken without faith: the gospel which is
properly the promise of remyssyon of sins and of iustyfycatyon for Christ,
teaches the justice of faith, which the law does not. Nor it is not the
justice of the law. For the law requires of us our works and our
perfection, but the promise offers unto us which be oppressed with sin and
death, frelye reconciliacyon for Christ which reconciliatyon is received, not
by works, but by only faith. This faith brings not with it a trust of the
own works, but only the trust of promise, or of the promised mercy in
Christ. wherefore this special faith by which we believe that our sins be
forgyuen for Christ and that god is pacyfyed and merciful for Christ,
obteyneth remyssyon of sins and iustifyeth us, and by cause in repentance,
that is, in the trouble of conscience it comfort and plucketh up our hearts
and regenerateth us, and brings unto us the holy spirit so that from
thenseforth ^e may do the law of god, that is, love God, fear God, think
that god hears us, obey god in all afflyctyons: it mortyfyeth the
concupiscence. etc. Thus faith which freely receives remyssyon of sins,
because it pleads Christ in estopell against the ire of god, as a mediator
and mercy stock pleads not in bar our own merytes or our own love, which
faith is the true knowledge of Christ, and uses the benyfytes of Christ and
regenerateth our hearts and goes before the fulfyllynge of the law. Of this
faith ye shall not find one syllable in the doctrine of our adversaries.
wherefore we reprove the adversaries, because they only teach the justice of the
law, and teach not the justice of the Euaungell which preaches unto us the
justice of faith in Christ.

What is the iustyfyenge faith.
THe adversaries only feign that faith is a knowledge of the hystorye, and
therefore they teach that it may stand with mortal syn. They speak therefore
nothi^ge of faith, by which Paul so often times says that men be iustyfyed,
for they which be reputed just before god, walk not in mortal sin. But that
faith which iustyfyeth, is not only a knoweledge of the hystorye, but it is to
assent to the promise of God, in which frelye for Christ is offered remyssyon
of sins and iustificacyon And lest a man should suspecte, that it is only a
knowledge, The diffinition of faith.
we will add more over that it is to will and to receive the offered promise of
remyssyon of sins and of justification. And a man may easily se the
diuersytye betwyxte this faith and betwyxt the justice of the law Faith is a
service which receives of god the offered benifites. The justice of the law
is a service which offers unto god our merits. with faith on these fashyon
will god be served, that we may receive of him the things which he promyseth
and offers. Now, that faith sygnifieth not only the knowledge of the
hystorye, but rather a trust which assenteth to the promise, Paul clearly
witnesses when he says. Justice therefore is by faith to thentente the promise
should be ferme and stable. For he means that the promise ca^ not be received
but by faith, wherefore he compares and knytteth together as correlatiues
promise and faith. How be it, it is sone judged what faith is if we consider
the Creed, where this article is put. Remission of sins. wherefore it is not
enough to believe that Christ was borne, did suffer, and rise again, oneles
we add also this article (Remyssyon of sins) which is the fynal cause of
the hystorye. To this article we must refere the rest, as, that for Christ
and not for our own merits we be pardoned of our sins. For what neded
Christ to begyuen for our sins, if our own merytes may satysfye for our
sins?

wherefore so often as we speak of the iustyfyenge faith, it is to be known
that these.3. obiectes must mete together, promise, and that free, and the
merytes of Christ as a raunsom and redemption. Promise is received by faith,
this word fre excludes our merits and signyfyeth that only by mercy is
offered the benefyte of Christ, the merytes be the rau^som, for there must be
some certain rede^pcion for our si^nes. The scripture often times cries for
mercy. And the holy fathers many times say that we be saved by mercy. So often
then as mencio^ is made of mercy, it is to be known, that faith is there
required which receives the promise of mercy. And again so often as we speak of
faith, we will that the obiecte be understand, that is to say the promised
mercy. For faith does not therefore justify or save, because it is of it self a
worthy work, but only because it receives the mercy promised. And these
service, theslatria, is most highly commended in prophets and psalms where as
the law teaches not fre remission of sins. But the fathers know the promise
made of Christ, that God for Christ would remyt sins. wherefore when they
understood that Christ should be a price and ransom for our sins, they knew
that our works were not a ransom of so great a thing. Therefore they received
by faith fre mercy and remissyo^ of si^nes, like as the holy fathers of the
new testament do. Here unto belong tho often repetycyons of mercy and faith in
the psalms, and prophets, as here. Si iniquitates obseruaueris domine. etc.
If thou markest? iniquities o lord, lord who shall sustain. Here he
confesses his sins, and yet he alleges not hes merytes. He adds. For
with the is mercyfulnes. Here he lyfteth up him self with the trust of the
mercy of God. And cytethe the promise. Sustinuit anima mea in verbo eius,
sperauit anima mea in domino. My soul is sustained in his word, my soul
has trusted in the lord, that is to say, because thou haste promised
remyssyon of sins, by this thy promise I am sustained. And Paul cyteth the
hystorye of Abraham. Abraham believed God, and it was recompted unto him for
ryghtwysnes. That is to wit, Abraham perceived that God was unto him
mercyful, only for his promise sake. He assented to the promise of God, nor
suffered not him self to be plucked away from it, all though he saw him
self unclean and unworthy. He perceived that God performs his promise for
hes own truth and not for our works or merytes. Truly the affrayed hearts
can have no rest, if they should think that for their own works, or own
love or fulfylli^ge of the law they should please God, for in the flesh
stycketh sin, which always accuses us. But then the hearts have rest when
in such affrayes they assure them selves that we therefore please God, be cause
he has promised, and that God perfourmeth his promise for his own truth and
not for our worthynes. Thus Abraham herd this saying. Fear thou not, for* I
am thy protector. Here he raised up him self and felt God mercyful unto him
not for his own deseruynge, but because the promise of god must needs be iuged
true. this faith therefore is imputed to him for ryghtwysnes, that is because
he assenteth to the promise, and takes the offered reconsilement, he is now
truly just and accepted unto God. not for his own works, but because he
takes the free promise of god. This auctoryte of Genyses pleased Paul not
without cause. we se how he layth on, how ernestlye he taryeth upon that
point, because he saw that the nature of faith might in that point be easaly
espied. He saw that the record of the imputacyon of justice was added not
with out a great skyll. He saw that the lawde of desernynge iustyfycacyon and
of pacyfyenge the conscience was taken away from works* when Abraham is
therefore pronounced right wise, because he assenteth to the promise and takes
the offered reconcilement, he pleads not in bar of gods ire his own
merytes or works. wherefore this place dylygently considered may plenteouslye
instruct godly minds in this matter, which shall so be understand, if the
affrayed minds have it before them and assure the^ selue that they ought to
assente to the free promise. For otherwise they can not be quyete onles they
presuppose that they have god their good lord, because he has so promised,
and not because our nature, life and works be worthy. Therefore also the
fathers were justified, not by the law, but by the promise and faith. And it is
a wonderful thing that the adversaries do make so little of faith. sith they
se it through out al scripture praised for the most high service, as in
the.49. Psalm. Call on me in time of trybulacyon, and I shall deliver the. Thus
will god be known, thus he will be worshyped, by receyuynge benefytes of him,
and receyuynge them for his mercyes sake, and not for our own demerytes. This
is the most ample consolacyon in all afflyctyons. And such consolacyons our
adversaries go about to destroy and put out of ure, in that they make faith
so little a service, and only ^eache men to contend with god by our own
works and merytes.

That the only faith in Christ iustyfyeth.
First, lest a man would think that we speak of the idle knowledge of the
Hystorye, Of the commensement and orygynal of faith.
we will show how faith cummeth. After we will show that it iustyfyeth, and
how this must be understand, and then we will assoyle thobiections of the
adversaries. Christ in the last of Luke commands his dyscyples to preach
repentance in his name, and remyssyon of sins. For the gospel argues every
man to be under sin, and to be gyltye of eternal ire and death, and offers
for Christ remissyon of sins and iustificacion which is received by faith.
Preaching of penance which reproves us does fray the conscience with true
and ernest afrayes. In these, the hearts ought again to conceive consolacyon,
which shall be, if they trust to the promise of Christ, that for him we have
remyssyon of sins. This faith erectyng and comfortynge us in those affrayes,
takethe remyssyon of sins, iustyfyeth and viuifyeth For that consolacion is a
new and a spiritual life. How the holy ghost is given by the schole me^
These be plain and open and the godly may understand them also the church
have recorded the same. The adversaries never show truly how the holy ghost
is given. They feign that the sacraments give the holy gooste ex opere
operato sine bono motu accipientis even of the very work it self without any
good motyon of the receyuer, as though the geuynge of the holy ghost were an
idle thing. But where as we speak of such faith which is not an idle
thought but which delivers from death and creates a new life in our hearts,
and needs the holy ghost, it stands not with mortal sin, but so long as
it is present it brings forth good frures, as we shall say here after. what
can be spoken of the converting of the ungodly or of the manner of
regeneratynge more sympely and more clearly? There be an infinite sort of
commentours upon the master of the sentence, let our adversaries bring forth
but one co^mentarye of them al, which speak any thing of the manner of
regeneratynge. When they speak of the habyte of love, they feign that men
deserve the holy gooste by their works, they teach not that it is received by
the word, even as the Anabaptystes do at this day. But we can not have to do
with god, god will not be caught, but by hes word. Therefore iustyfycacyon is
hade by the word, as Paul says. The Euaungell is the power of god to the
health of every beleuer. Also Faith is of hearing. A man might also out of this
place gather an argument that faith justifies, for if iustyfycacyon is only by
the word, and the word is only received by faith, it follows that faith
iustyfyeth. But there be greter reasons. This have we spoken to the end to show
the form and manner of regeneracyon, and that it may be understand what
manner of thing faith is whereof we speak.

The knowledge that faith justifies is necessary
Now we will show that faith iustyfyeth, wh^ere, first of all, the reders
must be admonyshed that as it is necessary to maynteyne this opinyon that
Christ is our medyatour, so is it necessary to defend that faith iustyfyeth.
For how shall Christ be a medyator, if in iustyfycacyon we use not him as a
medyator, if we think not that for him we be reputed ryghtwyse? And that it
is, to believe and trust to the merytes of Christ, that for hi^ god will surely
be pacified with us. Also as we must defend that beside the law, the promise
of Christ is necessary, so we must defend that faith iustyfyeth, for the
law teaches not free remyssyon of si^nes. Moreover the law can not be
fulfilled, onles we first receive the holy ghost. wherefore it is nedeful to
defend, that the promise of Christ is necessary. But this promise can not be
taken but by faith, Ergo, they which deny that faith iustyfyeth, do
nothing but teach the law, disanullynge the gospel, and dysanullynge
Christ. The taking of this proposytyon only faith iustyfyeth.
But some perchauns, when it is said that faith iustyfyeth, understands it
of the beginning, that faith should be the beginning of iustificatyon, or a
preperatyue to iustyfycacyon, so that it is not the very faith which makes
us acceptable to god, but the works which follow. And they dream that faith
is so hyghly commended because it is the beginning. For the beginning of ^
thing is greatly esteemed, and therefore it is commenly said. Principium
dimidium totius. The beginning is half of the hole. As if a man would say
that gramer makes the doctors of every science, because it is a preperatyue
to other scyencies. But we mean not thus of faith, but we defend that
properly and truly by faith we be for Christ reputed ryghtwyse, or accepted
to God. And because this word justify cari (to be iustyfyed) sygnyfyeth to be
made of unjust just, it sygnyfyeth also to be pronunced or reputed ryghtwyse.
For scripture speaks in both wyses. Therefore first we will show that only
faith makes of vnryghtwyse ryghtwyse, that is to wit, receives remyssyon
of si^nes. Sum men be offended with this pertycle sola (only) where as
nevertheless Paul says. we judge that man is iustyfyed by faith and not of
works. Also to the Ephesyans the second. It is the gift of god, not of us
neither of our works lest any man should glory. Also Roma. 3. Freelye
iustyfyed. If the exclusyue sola does dysplease them, let that them take from
Paul also these exclusyues / freely / not of works. It is a gift. And such
like, for these be also exclusyues. Doutles we exclude the opinyon of merit,
but we exclude not the word of God or the sacraments, as our adversaries do
mysreporte us. For we said before that faith is conceived by the herynge of
the word. And we extolle most cheflye the mynysterye of the word.

Love also and works ought to follow faith wherefore they be not so excluded
that they should not follow, but the trustyng of merit, of love, and works is
excluded in iustyfycacyon. And that we shall euedently show.

That remyssion of sins is by the only faith in Christ obtained.
WE think that the adversaries will also grant that in iustificacyon is first
necessary remission of sins. For we be al under sin. Then this shall be my
argument.

To obtain remission of sins is to be justified, according to this, Beati
quorum remiss sunt iniquitates, The first reason.
Blessed be they, whose sins be remitted.

But so it is, y^ by the only faith in Christ not by love or for love or
works, we obtain remission of si^nes, although ye love follows faith. Ergo
by only faith we be justified, understanding iustificacio^ to be, of the
vnryghtwyse to be made ryghtwyse, or to be regenerate. The minor may easily be
declared if we know how remission of sins is obtained. The adversaries do
full coldly dispute, whether remission of sins and the infusion of grace be
all one mutation, yea, or no. The idle persons had nothing else to speak. In
remission of sins is required that the fear of sin and of everlasting
death be vaynquyshed in men's hertes, as Paul witnesses. 1. Cor^. 15. The
probation of y^ minor.
The dart of death is syn. And the power of syn is the law. But thanks be to
god who gives to us victory through our lord Jesus Christ that is to say,
sin frayeth the conscience, and this is done by the law which shows
their of god against sin, but we ouercum by Christ. How? through faith,
when we lift up our selves through trust of his promised mercy for Christ.
wherefore our Minor we prove thus.

The ire of god can not be pacified if we lay against it our works, because
Christ is propowned our mercy stock so that for him the father should be
pacified with us. But Christ can not be received a mediator but by faith. Ergo
by only faith we purchase remission of sins, when we lift up our hertes with
the trust of the promised mercy for Christ. Also Paul to the Romans the.5.
chapi. says By him we have a passage to the father, and adds, through
faith How the adversaries understand Christ to be our mediator.
. we be thus then reconcyled to the father and receive remission of sins,
when we lift up our selves with the hope of the promised mercy for Christ. The
adversaries do so understand Christ to be a mediator and propiciatour,
because we deserve the habit of love, they bid us not use him as a mediator
now but they utterly bury Christ feynyng that we have these passage by our
own works, and that by them we deserve this habit of love (as they call it)
and that after by love we have peace of conscience. Is not this utterly to bury
Christ and to pluck down the hole doctrine of faith? Paul contraryly
teaches us to have passage, yt is to say, peace by Christ. And to show us
how this is, he adds, that we have passage through faith. Ergo by faith in
Christ we receive remission of sins, and we can not lay against the ire of
god, our love and our works.

Secondly. It is certain y^ sins be remitted because of Christ our
mercystocke. (...). The second reason.
who^ god has ordained to be a mercistocke. And Paul adds, through faith.
where. fore this mercystocke shall aid us, if by faith we stycke to the mercy
promised in him, and plede it in arreste of the judgment and ire of god. And
to this purpose it is written ad Hebreos.4. having a byshope. etc^. let us
approach with trust. He byddeth us approach to god, not by trust of our own
merits but by trust of our bishop Christ. Ergo he requires faith. Thyrdly.
Peter in ye acts. cap. x. says thus. The.iii. reason.
To him all the prophets bear wytnes, that all which believe in him receive
remission of sins through his name. How might he speak it more clearly? we
receive, he sayteh, remission of sins through his name, that is to say, for
his sake. Ergo not for our merits, not for our contricion, attricion, love,
ceremonies, works. And he adds, that believe in him. Ergo he requires faith.
For we ca^ not cleave to the name of Christ, but by faith. Furthermore he
alleges the consent of all the prophets. This is truly to allege the
authority of the church. But of this place we shall speak here after in the
title of penance. Fourthly. Remission of sins is a thing promised for
Christ. Ergo it can not be received but by faith only. For the promise can not
be received but by only faith. Rom^. 4. The.iiii. reason.
Therefore is it by faith, to the end it may be a sure promise, hangyng upon
grace as who should say. If the matter should hang upon our merits, the
promise were uncertain and unprofitable, because we can never determyne when
we have merited enough. And that ye assayed conscience understand right well.
Therefore Paul says Galat. 3. God has concluded all things under sin yt
the promise through the faith of Jesus Christ might be given to the beleuers.
Here he plucketh away merit from us, because he says, that all be gylty and
concluded under sin, then he adds that the promise (meaning of remission of
sins and iustificacion) is given, and tells how the promysse may be
received, yt is to say, by faith. And this reason taken out of the nature of
promysse is most chief with Paul, and often repeted. Nor there can not be any
thing inverted or feined to avoid this argument of Paul. wherefore let not
godly minds suffer them selves to be driven from this opinion, that by only
faith we receive remission for Christ. For in this they have a sure and ferme
co^solacion against the terrors of sin and against everlasting death, and
against all the gates of hell. And sith by only faith we receive remission of
sins and reconciliacion for Christ, ergo only faith justifies, because the
reconciled be reputed ryghtwyse and the chyldern of god, not for their own
clennes* but through mercy for Christ, if so be that we cleave to this mercy
by faith, and therefore the scripture records, that by faith we be reputed
ryghwyse.

Authorities of scripture that only faith iustifyeth.
we will add therefore authorities first of scripture and the^ of doctors,
that shall clearly testifye that only faith is the very justice by which we
be reputed just before god, that is to say, not because it is a work worthy
of it self, but because it receives the promise by which god has promised,
that for Christ he will be merciful to the beleuers in him, or be cause it
believes, that Christ is made for us by god a wysdom, justice, sanctificacion
and redemption: Authorities out of saint Paul.
Paul in the epistle to the Romans disputes principally of these place and
propouneth that we be freely justified by faith if we believe that god is
pacified with us for Christ. And in the third chapitre he brings in, this
proposicion which conteyneth the sum of his hole disputacion. Arbitramur.
igitur hominem fide iustificari, non ex operibus legis.i. we judge therefore
that man is justified by ^ayth and not by the works of the law. Here the
adversaries do i^terprete the works of the law to be the Leuitical
ceremonies. But Paul not only speaks of the ceremonies, The true
interpretacion of Paul.
but of the hole law. For he alleges a little after, forth of the Decalogie,
Non concupisces.i. thou shalt not covet. Moreover if ye moral works might
deserve remission of sins and iustificacion, then neded not Christ, nor the
promise, then all were to no purpose that Paul speaks of promise. He should
write also amys to the Ephesians, that we be saved freely, and that it is a
gift of god, and proceeds not of works. Also Paul alleges Abraham, he
alleges David. But these had a commandment of god of circumcision, wherefore
if any works justified it was necessary that tho works which then were
commanded should have justified. Austynes interpretacio^ upon Paul.
But Austyne does ryghtly teach that Paul spoke of the hole law, as he
disputes copiously in his book, de spiritu and litera, where at last he says
thus. His igitur co^sideratis pertractatis^^ pro viribus quas dominus donare
dignatur, colligimus non iustificare ^ominem preceptis bone vite, nisi per
fidem Iesa Christi..i. These therefore considered and handled according to the
power which god vouchsaueth to give us, we gather that man is not justified by
the precepts of good life, but by faith of Jesus Christ. And least we should
think that this sentence fell from Paul unawares, that faith justifies, he
mainteyneth and confyrmeth it with a long disputacyon in the fourth chapitre
to the Romans And after he repeteth it in all the epystles. In the.4. chap. to
the Romans he says thus. Operanti, merces non imputatur secundum graci^, sed
secundum debitum, Ei autem qui non operatur, credit autem in eum qui iustificat
impium, reputatur fides eius ad iusticiam.i. To him that works is given a
reward not of favor but of duty. Contrary wise, to him that works not, but
trusts on him that justifies the wicked, his believe is accounted for
ryghtwysnes. Here he clearly pronounces that very faith is accounted for
ryghtwysenes. Faith then is the thing which god pronounces to be
ryghtwysnes, and he adds that it is freely imputed. And he denies that it can
be freely imputed, if it should be due for works. Ergo he also excluded the
merit of moral works. For if to these were due the iustifycacion before god,
faith should not be accounted ryghwysenes without works. And after he says*
For we say that faith was i^puted to Abraham for ryghtwysnes. In the fyfthe
chapitre he says. Justified by faith we have peace toward god.i. we have
quiet and glad consciences before god. Roma. 10. with the heart it is believed
for ryghtwysnes. Here he pronounces faith to be the justice of the heart.

Gal. 2. Nos in Christo hesu credimus, vt iustificem^^ ex fide Christi, et non
ex operibus legis.i. we believe in Christ Jesus, that we may be justified by the
faith of Christ and not by the works of y^ law. Ephe. 2. Gratia enim saluati
estis per fidem et hoc no^ ex vobis, dei enim donum est, non ex operibus, ne
quis glorietur.i. For by grace ye be saved by faith and that not of your
selves (for it is the gift of god) nor of your works, least any man should
glory.

sed ex deo nati sunt. He gave them power to becum the children of god, they I
mean which believe in his name which be borne, not of blodes neither of the
will of the flesh neither of the will of man, but of god.

Ioh. 3. Sient Moses exaltauit serpe^tem in deserto, ita exaltari oportet
filium hominis, vt omnis qui credit in ipsum, non pereat. i. Lykewese as Moses
exalted the serpent in desert, so must the son of man be exalted, that all
which believe in him peryshe not. Also, Non misit deus filium sunin in mundum,
vt iudicet mu^dum, sed vt saluetur mundus per ipsum. Qui credit i^ eum non
indicatur.i. God sent not his son into the world yt he should judge the world,
but yt the world should be saved by him. who believes in him is not judged.

Authorities out of the Acts of the Apostles.
Acts. 13. Notum igitur sit vobis viri fratres, quod per hunc vobis remissio
peccatorum annunciatur. etc. i. Be it known therefore unto you (o brethern)
that by him remission of sins is preached unto you, and of al tho things by
which ye could not be justified in the law, in him all that believes is
justified. How might it be more clearly spoken of the office of Christ and
of iustifycacyon? The law, quod he, justified not, therefore Christ was given
that we should believe that we be justified for him. He openly plucketh from the
law iustifycacyon. Ergo for Christ we be accounted just, when we believe that
god is pacified with us for him.

Act. 4. This is the stone which is disallowed of you buylders which is made
the cornerstone, and there is not health in any other. For there is none other
name under heaven given unto men in which we ought to be saved. But the name of
Christ is only sticked to, by faith. Ergo by the trust of his name and not by
the trust of our works we be saved. For (name) signifies here a cause which
is alleged whereby health is obtained. And to allege the name of Christ, is to
trust in the name of Christ as in the cause or price for which we be saved.
Act. 15. Fide purificans corda nostra. i. By faith purifyeng our hertes.
wherefore the faith of which thapostles speak, is not an idle knowledge, but
a thing receyuyng the holy ghost and iustifyeng us.

Abacuc. 1. Iustus ex fide viuet. The prophet Abacuc.
The ryghtwyse man shall live of faith. Here first he says that men be just
by faith, because they believe that god is merciful, and he adds, that the
same faith viuifyeth, because this faith genderethin the heart peace and joy,
and everlasting life.

Esa. 53. Noticia eius iudicabit multos.i. The prophet^ Esaye.
The knowledge of hi^ shall judge many. But what is the knowledge of Christ but
to know the benefits of Christ and the promyses which by the Eua^gell he
has sparsed into the world? And to know the benefytes, is properly and
truly to believe in Christ, and to believe that the things which God has
promised for Christ, he will surely fulfill. But the scripture is full of
such aucthorytes and testymonyes, for otherwhiles it shows the law,
otherwhyles the promyses of Christ, remyssyon of sins and free acceptaunce
for Christ.

Authorites of doctors
There be also among holy fathers spread many like testymonyes. For Saint
Ambrose says in his Epistle to Ireneus thus. Subditus autem mundus eo per
legem factus est, quia ex prescripto legis omnes conueniuntur, et ex operibus
legis nemo iustificatur, Saint Ambrose
id est, quia per legem peccatum cognoscitur, sed culpa non relaxatur.
Videbatur lex nocuisse, que omnes fecerat peccatores, sed veniens dominus Jesus
peccatuz omnibus, quod nemo poterat euitare donauit, et chirographum nostru^
sui sanguinis effusione deleuit. Hoc est quod ait Abundauit peccatu^ per legem,
superabundauit autem gratia per Iesum. Quia postqua^ totus mundus subditus
factus est, totius mu^di peccatum abstulit, sicut testificatus est Johannes
dice^s Ecce agnus dei, ecce qui tollit peccatu^ mundi. Et ideo nemo glorietur
in operibus, quia nemo factis suis instificatur. Sed qui instus est, donatum
habet, quia post lauacrum iustificatus est. Fides ergo est que liberat per
sanguinem Christi quia beatus ille cui peccatum remittitur et venia donatur.
That is to say. The world is made subject therefore by the law, because by the
prescript of the law al be conuented before the high judge, and of the works
of the law no man is justified, that is, because by the law sin is known,
but the offense is not remytted, the law seemed to have hurted which made all
men sinners, but the lord Jesus by his coming pardoned unto al men, sin,
which no man could eschew, and did clean stryke out our chirografe with the
shedyng of his blood. This is it, that he says. Syn was aboundaunt by the
law. But grace by Jesus was more abundant. For after that the hole world was
become subject, he took away the sin of the hole world, as testifies Johan
saing. Lo the lamb of god, Lo he that takes away the syn of the world. And
therefore let no man glory in his works, for no man is iustyfyed hy his
factes. But he that is justified, has it given him. Wherefore faith is the
thing which delyuereth by the blood of Christ, for blyssed is he to whom
sin is remytted, and pardone given. These be the words of Saint Ambrose
which apertly do defend our opinion. For he plucketh away from works
iustificacyon, and gives it to faith, because it delyuereth by the blood of
Christ. Let all the Sentenciaryes be laid together on a heap, be they
furnyshed with never so glorious tytles, For some be called angelycal, some
seraphical, some subtyle, some irrefragable, All they red and red again shall
not make so much to the understanding of Paul, as this one sentence of
Saint Ambrose does.

Saint. Austyns.
In like sentence writes also Saint Austyne much against the Pelagyans, and
in his book de spiritu et litera he says thus. Ideo quippe proponitur
iusticia legis, quod qui fecerit ea^, viuet in illa, vt cum quisque
infirmitatem suam cognouerit non per suas vires, neque per literam ipsius
legis, quod fieri non potest, sed per fidem concilians iustificatorem,
perueniat et faciat, et viuat in eam. Opus rectum quod qui fecerit, viuit in
eo, non fit nisi in iustificato. Iustificatio autem ex fide impetratur. i. For
therefore is the justice of the law propowned, that who does it shall live in
it, so that when every man shall know his own infyrmity, he may attain it and
do it and live in it, not by his own powers, neither by the letter of the law
(which can not be done) but reconcylyng the iustyfier by faith. A right work
(which who does, shall live in it) is not done but in a justified person. And
iustificacyon is purchased by faith. Here he says clearly that the iustifyer
is reconcyled by faith, and iustifycacyon is purchased by faith. And a little
further he says. Ex lege timemus deum, ex fide speramus in deum, sed timentibus
penam absconditur gratia, sub quo timore anima Laborans. etc. per fidem
confugiat ad misericordiam dei, vt det quod iubet. That is to say. By the law
we fear god, by faith we trust in god, but from the^ that fear pain, grace
is hyd. With which fear the soul oppressed must fle by faith to the mercy of
god, that he may give the thing that he commands. Here Saint Austine
teaches that by the law the hearts be made aferde but by faith they receive
co^solatyon. And he teaches that first by faith we must purchase mercy or
we go about to do the law. we will recyte a little after other things also.

A cauillatyon refuted.
Truly it is a wonderful thing that the adversaries be nothing moved with
so many places of scripture which openly give iustyficacyon to faith, and
take it from works, Think they that the same thing is so often repeted in
vain? Or suppose they that the thing so often repeted eschaped out of their
mouth, inspired with the holy ghost, unadvisedly? But these idle workers have
invented a proper cauillation to defete this matter. They say that Paul must
be vnderstonded be side formata, so that they will not attrybute iustificacyon
unto faith but by reason of love, nay utterly they will not attrybute
iustyfycacyon to faith, but only to love. For they dream that faith may
stand with mortal sin. To what purpose belong this but that they will
again dysanul the promise, and return to the law? If faith receives
remyssyon of sins for love, remissyon of sins shall be always uncertain,
for we never love so much as we owe, yea we love not, onles our hearts be
assured that our sins be perdoned, so the adversaries whiles in remyssyon of
sins and in iustyfycacyon they require a trusting of their owe love, they
utterly disanull the Euangell of free remyssyon of sins, where as yet they
nether perform that love nor understand it, onles they believe that remyssyon
of sins is freely received. We also say that love ought to follow faith as
Paul also teaches saying. In Christ Jesus neither cyrcumcysyon is any thing
worth, nor uncircumcision, but faith workynge by love. And yet we may not for all this think that we shall be pardoned our sins or be reconciled because of
this love, as we receive not remyssyon of sins for other works following,
but only by faith in the proper sygnifycatyon we receive remyssyon of sins.
For the promise can not be taken but by faith. But faith in the proper sense
is thassentynge to gods promise. For of this faith speaks scripture. And
because it receives remyssyon of sins and reconcyleth us to god, we be first
accounted ryghtwyse by faith, o^ we love and do the law, notwithstanding
love ensues. And yet this is not an idle knowledge, nor it can not stand with
sin, but it is the work of the holy ghost whereby we be delivered from
death, and the minds (which tofore were affrayed) erecte and viuifyed. And
because these faith receives only remyssyon of sins and makes us
acceptable to god and quiet of conscience, it might better be called gracia
gratum faciens. ^. a grace making a man acceptable then love may, which is
theffecte ensuynge. Faith may better than chariti be called gratia gratu^
facies.
Hethervnto we have very copiously showed aswele by authorities of scripture, as
by reasons deryued out of scripture, that by only faith is granted remyssyon
of sins and that only faith iustyfyeth, that is, makes of iniust just, and
regenerate.

The knoweledge of this faith is necessary.
It is easily judged how necessary the knowledge of this faith is. For in this
only is espied thoffyce of Christ, by this only we receive the benefits of
Christ, this only brings unto godly minds a sure and ferme consolacyon. And
it is a necessary thing that some doctrine be publyshed in the church by
which men may conceive a sure hope of health. For thaduersaries give unhappy
counsel unto men which bid them doubt whether they have obtained remyssyon or
no. The unhappy council of the adversaries
How shall these fellows bear up them selves in death, which have hard
nothing of this faith? which think that they owe to doubt whether they have
obtained remyssyon of sins or no? furthermore the Euaungell of Christ must
needs be retained in the church, that is to say the promise that sins be
freely remitted for Christ, this Euaungell they utterly dysanull which teach
nothing of this faith. But the schole men of this faith speak not one word.
And our adversaries all to gether follow them and do dysalowe this faith. Nor
they see not that they defete the hole promise of the fre remyssyon of sins
and of the justice of Christ where as they dysproue this faith.

Of love and fulfyllynge of the law.
HEre thaduersaryes obiecte. Si vis ad vitam ingredi serua mandata That is to
say. If thou will enter into life, keep the commandments. Also, The doers
of the law be justified, and many other like sente^cies of the law, to which
before we make answer, we will show our opinion of love, and of the
fulfyllynge of the law. It is written in the prohete, I will give my law in
their hearts. And Paul says that the law is establyshed and not abrogate by
faith. And Christ says. Roma. 3.
If thou wylt enter into life, keep the commandments. Also, If I have not
love, I am nothing These and such like sentencyes testifye that the law must
begin in us although not absolutely in an high perfectyon, and owes to to
increase as much as may be more and more. We speak not of the ceremonies, but
of that law which is made of the motions of the heart. I mean the Decalogye.
And because faith brings with it the holy ghost and enge^dereth a new life
in the hearts, it must of necessity also enge^der spiritual motions in the
hearts. And which be tho mocyons the prophet shows when he says. I will
give my love into their hearts. wherefore after that by faith we be justified
and renewed, we begin to fear god, to love god, to crave and look after
socoure of god, to give thanks unto him, to preach him, and to obey him in
afflictions, we begin also to love our neybours, because our hearts have
spiritual and holy mocions. These things can not be done onles, after that we
be justified by faith and regenerate, we receive the holy ghost, first,
because the law can not be done without christ, also the law can not be done
without the holy ghost. But the holy ghost is received by faith according
to the saying of Paul, Gasa. 3.
That we may receive the promise of the spirit by faith. Also how can man's
heart love god so long as he feleth him grievously dyspleased with us, and to
oppress us with temporal and perpetual calamities? but the law always
accuses us, always shows yt god is angry. God therefore is not loved until
we have received mercy by faith. So at last is made an amiable object.
Although therefore cyuyle works, that is to say, thexterne works of the law
without Christ and with out the holy ghost may be in some part done* yet it
appears by that which we have said, that the things which be properlye
apperteynynge to the divine law I mean thaffectyons of the heart toward god
which be commanded in the first table can not be done without the holy
ghost. But our adversaries be plesaunt diuynes. They behold the second table
and the polityke works, but the first table they nothing regard, as though
it pertayned nothing to the purpose, or at lest way they require only externe
works. That eternal law and far put above the sense and understanding of
al creatures, which is (Thou shalt love thy lord God with all thy heart)
they utterly not consider. But Christ was for this end given unto us that for
him remission of sins and the holy ghost should be granted us, which might
create in us a new and everlasting life, and an everlasting ryghtwysnes, and
which might first of al show unto us Christ, as it is written. He shall
notirize me, for of mine he shall take and show it unto you. Ioh. 16.
And after bring also other gifts as love, invocation, thanks gyuynge,
chastitye, pacyence. etc^. wherefore the law can not be truly performed onles
we first receive the holy ghost by faith. Therefore Paul says that by
faith the law is establyshed and not abrogate or avoided. For then or else
never is the law fulfilled when the holy ghost is in that man. 2. Cor. 3
And Paul teaches that the veil with which the face of Moses was muffled
can not be take away but by faith in Christ, by which is received the holy
ghost. For thus he says. The veyle.
But until this day when Moses is red, the veil is put over their hearts.
But when they shall be converted to God the veil shall be take away. The lord
is a spirit, and where the spirit of the lord is there is lybertye. By the
veil understands Paul an humane opinion of the hole law, of the Decalogie
and ceremonies, that is to say, that hypocrites do think that externe and
civil works do satysfye the law of god, and that sacryficies and ceremonies
even of them self do iustyfye before god. But then this veil is plucked from
us, that is to say, this error is taken away, when god shows to our hearts
our uncleanness and greatness of sin. There first we se our selves to be far
from the fulfyllynge of the law. There we acknoweledge how that the flesh
being idle and careless, fears not god, not thinks verily that god
regards us, but that we be casually borne and vanyshe away like brute bestes.
There we find thexperyence that we believe not that god forgyueth us and
hears us, but when we hearing thevangell and forgyuenes of sins begin to
lift up our selves by faith, we conceive the holy ghost, so that now we may
think ryghtly of god, and dread god and believe him. etc^. By this appears
that without Christ and without the holy gooste, the law can not be done.
wherefore we profess that we must neades inchoate or begin to fulfill unto
our powers the law, and ever more attempt to do it more and more. And we
compryse here both two, as well the spiritual mocyons, as the outward good
works. wherefore the adversaries do falsely calumnyate us in reportynge that we
teach not good works, sithe we not only require them, but also show how
they may be done. The very proof of the thing does conde^pne and bewraye the
ypocrites which attempt by their own powers to do the law, that they can not
perform the thing yt they attempt. For the nature of man is far to weke of
the own powers to resyst the devil, who has al in his hold as captives and
prisoners which be not delivered by faith. The powers of Christ is requisite
against the devil, and therefore because we know that for Christ we be herd
and receive a promise: it is requisyt that we pray that the holy ghost may
govern us and protect us, lest we fortune to err deceyuyng our selves, and
least by wicked impulsion we take upon us any thing against the will of god.
As the Psalm teaches. He led captivity a captive, he gave gifts to men. For
Christ has veynquyshed the devil and has given unto us a promise and the
holy ghost, to the end that we may also vaynquyshe by y^ socoure of god. And
Ioha^ says. 1. Ioh. 3.
To this intent appeared the son of god, that he might losen the works of the
devil. Furthermore we teach not only how the law may be done, but also how
the thing that is done may please god, which is, not because we satisfy the
law, but because we be i^ Christ, as it shall be said a little here after. So
it is evident that we require good works, yea we add also, that it is
impossible to severe the love of god (though it be little) from faith. For by
Christ we approach to the father and after the receite of remission of sins
we be assured that we have god, that is to say, that we be regarded of god, we
make inuocacion, we give thanks, we fear, we love, as Johan teaches in the
first epistle. we love him (quod he) because he first loved us, meaning,
because he gave for us his son and remitted our sins. Thus he signifies that
faith goes before, and love follows. Also the faith of which we speak, ^s
declared in penance.i. it is conceived in ^eares of the conscience which
feleth the wrath of god kyndled against our sins and seeks remission of
sins and a gayle delivery from sin. And in such fears and other
afflictions this faith owes to encreace and be confirmed. wherefore it can not
be in them which live after their flesh which delight in their lusts and
obey them. Therefore Paul says There is no condempnacion now to these which
be in Christ Jesus which walk not after their flesh but after the spirit.
Also, we be dettours not to the flesh that we should live after the flesh.
For if ye live after the flesh, ye shall dye. But if in spirit ye mortifye
the acts of the body ye shall live. Wherefore this faith which receives
remission of sins in the troubled and affrayed heart and fleyng sin,
dwells not in them which follow their lusts, nor stands not with deadly
sin. Out of these effects or operacions of faith the adversaries pycke out
one and that is love* and teach that it iustifyeth. Thus it manifestly
appears that they only teach the law. They reach not first that we receive
remission of sins by faith. They teach not of the mediator Christ, that
for Christ we have God our good lord, but for our own love. And yet what
manner of love that is, they tell not, nor can not tell. They brag and glory
that they fulfill the law where as this glory is properly due to Christ, and
they lay the affia^^ce of their own works to the judgment of god, for they
say that they deserve grace and eternal life de condigno.i. of their own
worthynes. This is utterly a wicked and a vain affiaunce. For in this life we
can not satisfye the law, because the carnal nature cease not to bring
forth evil affections, al though the spirit in us resysteth the^. But a man
may demand of us a question, A questi^^.
sithe that we also confess yt love is the work of the holy ghost and sith it
is ryghtwysnes, for it is the fulfyllyng of the law, why do not we teach that
it justifies* To this we answer. First it is certain that we receive not
remission of sins neither by love nor for or love, but for Christ by only
faith. Only faith which looks to the promise and is assured that god
forgiueth because Christ dyed not in vain: ouercometh the fears of sin and
of death. If a man doubts whether his sins be forgyuen him, he
disworshyppeth Christ, sithe he judges his sin greater or stronger then the
death and promise of Christ, where Paul says that grace surmounteth sin,
that is to say, that mercy is above sin. who thinks that he attayneth
remission of sins because he loves: dishonoreth Christ, and he shall find in
the day of gods judgment this affyaunce of his own propre justice to be
wicked and void. Ergo faith must reco^cile and make of the iniust just. And as
we receive not remission of sins by the other virtues or for the other
virtues of the law as for patience, chastity, obedience toward the
superiors. etc^ (and yet these virtues must ensue: so we neither receive
remissyon of sins because of the dilectio^ of god. Howbeit it is a commune
form of speaking otherwhyles to comprise in one word both the cause and the
effect by a figure called Synecdoche, as in the seventh of Luke Christ says.
Many sins be forgyue^ her, because she loved much. For Christ expouneth him
self when he adds. Thy faith has saved the. Christ then meant not, that
the woman by that work of love should deserve remission of sins. and
therefore he clearly says. Thy faith has saved the. But faith is the thing
which conceiueth mercy for the word of god freely. If ye deny that these is
faith, ye utterly know not what faith means. The very historye of it self
shows sufficiently what he calls love in this place. The woman came brynging
with her this opinion of Christ, that in him* she should find remission of
sins. This worship is the most high worship of Christ, she could give no
greater worship unto him. This is the true fashyon of acknowledgyng Messiah,
to seek at him remission of sins. And to conceive this opinion of Christ,
thus to worship him, is rightly and truly to believe. But this word (love)
Christ used not to the woman but to the Pharisee, for he compared the hole
worshyppyng of the Pharisee with the hole worshyppyng of the woman. He chydeth
the Pharisee because he acknoweledged him not to be Messiah, although he did
unto him these externe officies as unto a stranger and an holy and great man,
he poynteth to the woman and commends her worshyppyng, her ointment, ^eares.
etc^. which all were signs of faith and a certain confession that at Christ
she sought remission of sins. Undoutedly this was a great example, which not
without cause moved Christ to chyde the Pharisee which was a wise and an
honest man, but one that believed not. This impiety he vpbraideth him and
instructs him by the example of the woman, signifieng that it was a shame y^
where as an unlearned woman believed god, he a doctor of the law believed not,
and acknowleged not Messiah, nor sought not at him remission of sins and
salvation. So the^ he prayseth the hole worshyppyng, as it is often done in
scripture, that in one word we should co^prise many as here after we shall
show more at large in like places, as in this saying Give alms and all shall be
clean, he requires not only almesdedes but also the justice of faith: so also
here when he says, Many sins be remytted unto her because she loved much,
yt is to say, because she has worshypped me truly by faith and excercises and
signs of faith: he co^pryseth the hole worshyppyng, but in the mean season
yet, he teaches this, that properly remission of sins is received by faith,
although love, confession and other good works do necessaryly ensue. wherefore
he means not this, that those fruits be a reco^pense or raunsum for which
remission of sins is given which may reconcile us to god. we dispute of a
great thing even of the honor of Christ, and from whens the godly minds may
fetch a sure and ferme consolacion, whether our trust is to be put in Christ
or in our works If so be that we owe to set our trust in our works, then we
must pluck from Christ the honor and title of a mediator and redemer. And
yet we shall find in the judgment of god that this confidence is vain and
that the conscience from thens shall ru^ne into despair. That if remission of
sins and reconciliacyon chaunseth not freely for Christ, but for our love and
merits: no man shall have remission of sins, but where he fulfylleth the hole
law, for the law justifies us not, so long as it can accuse us. It is
evident then, sith iustificacion is reconciliacion for Christ, that by faith we
be justified, for it is most certain that by only faith is received remission
of sins. The solucio^ of the question why love iustifyeth not.
Now therefore let us answer to the question before proposed, why love
iustifyeth not. The adversaries think ryghtly that love is the fulfilling of
the law. And doubtless the obedience toward the law were ryghwisnes, if we
could do the law. But we have here tofore showed, yt the promises were
therefore given, because we could not do the law. And for this self cause
denies Paul that we be justified by the law. Thaduersaries be deceived
because in this hole co^trouersarie, they have respect only to the law. For
humane reason can none otherwise judge, but that iustificacion is to be sought
for in the law, because the obedience toward the law is justice. But the
Euangel calls us away from the law to the promises and teaches that we be
reputed just, not for the obedience of the law (for we satisfye not the law)
but because that reconciliacion is given unto us for Christ, which we only
receive by faith. wherefore before we do the law we must by faith receive
remission of sins and reconciliacion. O Lord god with what face dare these
men name Christ, with what countenance dare they behold the Eua^gell which
deny that we obtain remission of si^nes for Christ by only faith? Secondly,
this self fulfyllyng of the law which follows renouacion: is both small and
unclean. For though renouacion be attempted and sumwhat begun: yet the
dregs of sin stycke still in nature, always accusyng us, onles by faith in
Christ we obtain remission of sins, and know that we have a cummynge to
god, not for our own fulfyllyng of the law, but for Christ. Therefore that
fulfyllyng of the law is not accepted for it self but for faith. Wherefore
when Paul says that the law is stablyshed by faith, not only this must be
understand, yt they which be regenerate by faith do conceive the holy ghost
and have mocions consentyng to the law of god, but most of all it is
requysite to add this, that we owe to think that we be far from the
perfection of the law. Wherefore we may not affirm that before god we be
reputed just for our own fulfyllyng of the law but we must think that we be
recou^pted just or acceptable for Christ, and not for the law or for our
works, and that this imperfecte or inchoate fulfyllyng of the law pleases
god because we be in Christ, and also that for the faith in Christ, the
lackyng of fulfyllyng the law is not imputed unto us. This teaches Paul,
saying. Gal. 3.
Christ redeemed us from the malediction of the law, being made for us a
curse, that is to say, the law condempneth all men. But Christ, because he
void of sin sustained the penalty of sin and was made an host for us, he
took away the rigorous power of the law so that it shall not accuse nor
co^de^pne the beleuers in him, for he is our propiciacion for which we be now
accounted ryghtwise. In like sentence he writes to the Colossenses. In Christ
ye be consummate or perfyte, as who should say, although ye be yet far from
the perfeccion of the law, yet the dregs or leauynges of sins do not
condemn you, because ye have for Christ a certain and ferme reconciliacion,
so that ye believe, natwithstandyng that sin stycketh still in the flesh. For
the death and the satisfaccio^ of Christ given for us, ought to be set far
above the very law, to the end that we may be assured that through ye
satysfaccyon we have god merciful unto us, and not for our fulfyllyng of the
law. wicked is that trust which is put in our fulfyllyng of the law. But
that trust is necessary which is put in the satisfaccyon for Christ.

The third reason.
Thyrdly. Only that thing justifies before god which pacifieth the conscience.
For so long as the conscience flees the judgment of god, and is angry with
god, we be not right wise nor viuifyed. But only faith pacifyeth the
conscience, according to this of Paul. Justified by faith we have peace.
Also, The ryghtwyse man shall live by faith, yt is to say, by faith he
veynquysheth the fears of death by faith he is sustained and conceyueth joy
and life. And this brings faith, not because it is a worthy work of it
self, but only because it reuiueth the offered promise, nothing regardyng the
own propre worthynes. Only therefore faith iustifyeth and good works do please
by reason of faith. what can the adversaries bring against this reason? what
can they invent against the manifest troth? For the Minor is most certain
that our works can not pacifye the conscience, sithe god judges and reproves
us and shows unto us our uncleanness. And that the scripture does oftentimes
inculcate and drive into our hedes. As the Psalm. Non intres in iudicium cu^
seruo tuo, quia non iustificavitur in conspectu tuo (...). that is to say.
Enter not into judgment with thy servant, for no living creature shall be
justified in thy sight. Here he quyte takes away from all, yea and from the
saynctes and servants of god the glory of justice if god did not pardon but
would judge and detecte their hertes. For where as in other places the Psalmist
does glory of his own ryghtwysenes: he speaks of his quarrel or cause against
the persecutours of the word of god, and not of his personal clennes, and he
desires that the quarrel and glory of god may be defended. As in the seventh
Psalm. Iudica me domine secundum iusticiam meam. etc. i. Judge me lord
according to my ryghtwysnes. And in another place. Judge (O lord) my cause.
But on the other part he teaches that no man can sustain the judgment of
god if he observes our sins. For thus he says. Psalm^. 129.
Si iniquitates obseruaueris domine, domine quis sustinebi^. If thou would
mark (o lord) the iniquities of men, who can (o lord) endure? And Job
says. V^rebar omnia opera mea.i. I feared all my works. Job. 9.
Also if I were washed even as it were with waters of snow, and my hands did
shine as most pure and clean, yet thou wylt embrewe me with fylthynes. And
Proverb. 20. Who can say, my heart is clean? And.1. Joan. 1. If we say that we
have not sin, we seduce our selves and troth is not in us. Also in the Pater
noster the holy men desire remission of sins. ^ holy men also have sins. In
the book of Numer. And the innocent shall be no innocent. And Zachary says.
Sil^at a facie domini omnis caro.i. Let every man hold his tongue in the
lords presence. And Esaye. Every flesh is hay, and all his glory is like a
flower of the field. The hay wythereth up, and the flower fades, because the
spirit of the lord has blowe^ in it, that is to say, the flesh and the
justice of the flesh ca^ not abide the judgment of god. And Jonas says in
the second chapter. In vain they observe vanities which leave mercy.i. Al
trust is void, save the trust of mercy. Mercy saves us, our own merits,
our own propre endeavors save us not. These and semblable sentencies in
scriptures testify that our works be unclean and have need of mercy.
Wherefore works do not pacify the conscience, but mercy conceived by faith.

Fourthly. Christ cease not to be a mediator still after that we be
renewed. The.4. reason.
For they err which say that he meriteth only the first grace, and that we
the^ by our own fulfyllyng of the law do please and deserve everlasting life.
The mediator Christ taryeth still, and we must always think yt for him we
have god pacifyed although we be unworthy as Paul says. By him we have an
enter to god thorugh faith. For our fulfyllyng of the law as we said is
unclean sithe our nature is horriblely corrupted. Therefore the Psalm says
Blessed be they whose sins be forgyuen. Wherefore we have need of remission of
sins yea even when we have good works. But that remission is always
purchased by faith, so Christ remains a bishop and mediator. go that
fulfyllyng of the law pleases not of it self. But because we conceive Christ
by faith and feel that we have god pacified not for the law but for Christ.

The.5. reason.
Fyfthly. If we should think that after baptism we ought to be accepted not by
faith in Christ but for our fulfyllyng of the law: our conscience should never
be quyete but should run into desperation. For the law always accuses sith
we never satisfy the law, which thing the hole church confesses. For Paul
says. Good that I would do I do not but evil that I would not do I do. He
also says In mind I serve the law of god but i^ flesh I serve the law of
syn. For who sufficiently loves or sufficiently fears god / who patiently
enough susteyneth tribulacions which god puts upon him, who does not often
doubt whether humane things be ruled by gods providence / who does not often
doubt whether god hears his prayer / who does not often disdysdayne and
grudge that the wicked have better fortune than the godly people, and that the
godly be oppressed of the ungodly, who is not angry with the judgment of god
when he seems to cast us away / who does satisfy his calli^g, who loves his
neighbor as him self who is not overthrown of his concupisce^ce? Of these
sins speaks the psalm saying. For this every saint shall pray to the. Lo
here he says that saints or holy men desire remission of sins. They be
more then blind which se not that the evil affections i^ the flesh be not
sins, of which Paul says, The flesh lusts against the spirit, the
spirit against the flesh. The flesh distrusteth god / trusts in things
present, seeks humane socours in distress and affliction yea against the
will of god / it flees tribulations which by the commandment of god it
owes to suffer / it doubts of the mercy of god. The holy spirit in me^nes
tencies of the law, one solution may be given, that the law can not be done
without Christ, and if any civil works be done without Christ, they please
not god. Wherefore when the works be preached it is necessary to be added that
faith is required, that for faith they be preached, that they be fruits and
testimonies of faith. What thing can be spoken more symply and syncerely tha^
this doctrine? For it is necessary to the knowledge of the benefytes of Christ
to discern the promyses from the law: Ambiguouse and perilous causes do
engender many and sundry solutions. But in good and ferme causes one or two
solutions taken out of the fountaynes do answer all that may be objected.
Which thing also appears in this our cause. For that rule which I right
now recyted expounneth all the saynges which be recited of the law and of
the works. For we grant that the scripture otherwhyles does teach the law,
otherwhyles the free promise of remyssyon of sins for Christ. But our
adversaries do utterly destroy the promise in sainge that faith does not
justify, but teach that for our love and works we receive remission of
sins, and reconciliation. For if remissyon of sins should hang of the
condition of our works, so were it very uncertain. For we never do sufficient
works. Then the promise shall be put out of ire. Wherefore we call again good
minds to the consideration of the promises, and we teach them of the free
remyssyon and reconcilement that is made by the faith in Christ. After this,
we add also the doctrine of the law, not that by the law we should deserve
forgyuenes of si^nes, or that for the law we should be compted ryghtwyse, and
not for Christ, but for this intent, because god requires good works. For we
must wisely distinct the law and the promyses. It must be seen what
scripture gives to the law, and what to the promyses. For it prayseth and
commands good works in such sort that it takes not away the free promise
nor the benefyte that we have by Christ. For good works are to be done
because God requires them and therefore they be the effects of regeneration as
Paul teaches. Ephe. ^.
We be his work made by Christ Jesus to good works which God has prepared
that we should walk in them. Wherefore good works ought to ensue faith, as a
geuynge of thanks toward god, also that in them faith may be both
excercised and increase, and be showed to other, that by our confession other
may be styrred to deuotyon. Therefore says Paul that Abraham took
circumcision not that for the very work he should be compted ryghtwise, but
that he might have a mark printed in his body, whereby he might be brought in
rememberaunce and conceive still more faith and more. Also to thentente he
should confess his faith before other and by his wytnessynge provoke other to
believe. Abel.
So Abell by reason of his faith offered a more acceptable sacrifice for the
sacrifice pleased god not for the very sacrifice but because Abel by his faith
was assured that god was pleased with him because of hes mercy. And he did
that work only to the end to exercise his faith and to provoke other by his
ensample and confession to believe. Sith good works ought after this sort
ensue faith: men that can not believe and determyne in their hearts that they
be freely pardoned for Christ's sake* do use works far an other way. These
persons when they see the works of saints and holy persons, they judge after
a worldly fasho^ that the saints by tho works have deserved forgiveness of
sins and that for tho works they be accounted ryghtwyse before God. Therefore
they follow them, and think that by like works they deserve remyssion of
sins, they go about to pacifye the ire of God and trust that for such
works they shall be accounted ryghtwyse. These wicked opinions in works we
damn. The first reason.
First because they obscure the glory of Christ when men do propowne to god
these works as a price and raunsom. Thus the honor due to only Christ is
given to our works. The se^o^de reso^
Secondly, because that notwithstanding all their good works yet the
conscience fyndeth no peace in them, but heapynge works upon works in true
trobles at last dispayreth, for when it finds no work clean enough, the
law always accuses and engenders ire. Therdly. Such never atteyne to the
knowledge of god when the conscience fleing the ire of god can not obtain
peace nor be assured that God hears them. The.3. reason.
But when faith comes which believes that we be freely justified: she dare
call upon God and feleth that she is hard and she atteyneth to the true
knowledge of God. For in the world stycketh always a wicked opinion of
works. The Gentels
The Gentyls had sacrifices which they took of the fathers, whose works they
follow but their faith they hold not, but imagyned that tho works were a
satisfaccion and price to reconcile God unto them. The people of the law
followed sacrifiicies with this opinion that for tho works they should pacifye
God even for the self work. In which thing we se how vehemently the
prophets chyde the people as. Psalm. 49
Non in sacrificii^ arguam te. I shall not reprove the for thy sacrifyces. And
Hieremie. I gave no commandment of sacrifycies. Such places do damn not
the works (for God commanded them as civil excercyses in this politic
governance) but they damn the wicked persuasion in that they thought to
pacifye God by tho works, and did cast away faith. And because no works
that they did, quieted their conscience, therefore they still devised new
works beside the commandments of God. And the examples of saints most of
all moved me^, for by the imitation of the^ they hoped to be reconciled as they
were. The people of Israel saw that the prophets sacrifysed in high
mounteynes. They began with a wonderful devotion to follow this work that by
it they might please God. But the prophets sacrifyced in high mountains not
that by tho works they might deserve forgyuenes of sins, but because they
taught in tho places. Therefore they there propowned an example of their faith.
The people hard that Abraham offered up his son. Wherefore they also (that by
alyke work they might pacifye the ire of God) did sacrifyce their own
children. But Abraham not with such opinion offered his son, The sacrament of
y^ Aul^e^
that the self work should be a price and redemptyon of his sins and so to
be justified. So in the church was instituted the supper of the lord or
sacrament of the Altar, for a rememberance of the promyses of Christ of which
in this sacrament we be admonished, and that faith should be confyrmed in us,
and that we should confess emonge other our faith and extolle the benefytes of
Christ, as Paul says. As of^e as ye shall receive it, ye shall preach or
show the death of the lord. etc. But our adversaries co^tende that the mass
is a work which of the self iustifyeth and takes away the gyltynes of the
sin and of the pain in them for whom it is done. Saint Anthony, Bernarde,
Dominik, Francise, and other holy fathers did chose a certain kind of life,
for other profitable excercises, but yet they wist that they were reputed just
for faith in Christ and not for tho excercises. But the multitude after them
followed not the faith of the fathers but the examples without faith, that by
tho works they should obtain forgyuenes and consequently iustifycation. Thus
erreth man's mind touching works because they understand not the justice of
faith. And this error the Gospel rebukes which teaches that men be
ryghtwyse not for the law, but for Christ, but Christ by only faith is won,
go by only faith for Christ we be recompted just. But the adversaries obiecte
a place out of the Corinthes. An obiectyon.
If I hade all the faith, and have no charity I am nothing. And here they
royally triumph. Paul, say they, in these place certifyeth the hole Church
that only faith iustifyeth not. But it is an easy thing to answer sith we
have before showed what we think of love and works. This place of Paul
requires love, and that we also require. For we said before that there must
be in us a renewynge and an imperfect fulfyllinge of the law, Wherefore if a
man casts away love, although he has a great faith, yet he retayneth it not.
For he retayneth not the holy ghost. Nor it ensues not therefore, that love
iustifyeth, that is to wit, that for love we receive remission of si^nes,
that love vanqwysheth the fear of death and of syn, that love ought to be put
against the wrath and judgment of God, that love satysfyeth the law, and
that they which be renouate be acceptable to God for the fulfyllynge of the
law and not freely for Christ. Paul says not so, which yet the adversaries
feign that he says. Now if by our love we overcome the wrath of God, if by
our love we deserve before God remission of sins, if by our fulfyllynge of
the law we be accepted: let the adversaries take away the promise of Christ,
let them defete the Gospel which teaches that we have an enter to the
father by Christ our mediator, which teaches that we not by our fulfyllynge
of the law but for Christ be accepted. The adversaries do corrupt many
places, because they bring their opinions unto them, and take not their
opinions out of them. For what incommoditie has this place if we pluck from
it the interpretation which the adversaries do sow unto it of their own, not
understanding what is justification or how it is made. The Corinthes which
before were justified had received many excellent gifts. And they were fervent
in the begi^nyng as commonly it comes to pas but after there began to be
disse^sio^s amongst them, as Paul signifies, they began to be weary of good
teachers. Therefore Paul chydeth them calling them home again to the officies
of love. Nor he desputeth not here of remission of sins, of the manner of
justification, but he speaks of the fruits. And he understands it of love
toward the neighbor. But it is a great folly to dream that love toward ma^^
justifies before god, sith i^ iustificacion we have to do with god, his ire
must be pacified, and the conscience must be quie^ed toward god. And none of
all these things be done by ye love, but only by mercy, these things be
brought about. And mercy is by only faith atteyned. Yet I must needs grant
that if love be lost the holy ghost is lost and if the holy ghost be lost,
faith must needs be also lost. Therefore he says, If I have not love, but he
adds not the affirmative that love iustifyeth. But they dispute that love is
preferred before faith and hope. An objection.
For Paul says, that the greatest of these is love. Now it is most lykely
that the greatest and chefest virtue does iustifye. The solutyon.
To this I answer thus. Although Paul in this place speaks properly of the
love of the neighbor and signifies that love is greatest because it has
most fruits, where as faith and hope only have to do with god, but love
outwardly toward men has i^finite officies: yet let us grant unto our
adversaries that the love of god and our neighbor is the greatest virtue, sith
these precepte is the greatest Thou shall love thy lord god. etc. But how
shall they gather hereby, that love justifies? Mary say they, because the
greatest virtue justifies. Not so, for like as the greatest or first law
does not justify, so does neither the greatest virtue of the law. For there
is no law which more accuses us, which makes more that our conscience is
angrye with the judgment of god, tha^ this greatest law does Love thy lord
god with all thy heart. For what one of all the saints save only Christ dare
boste that he has satisfied this law? Ergo the virtue of the law iustifyeth
not. But that virtue justifies which takes reconcilement that is given for
Christ's sake. This virtue is faith nor it iustifyeth not for the own
worthynes but only because it receives mercy by which for Christ's sake we be
recoumpted just. For we be just that is to say accepted to god not for our
own perfection but by mercy for Christ. if it so be, that we take it and lay
it against the wrath of god. But the adversaries do give justification to love
for none other cause but for as much as they teach the law and dream that
ryghtwisenes is the obedience of the law For man's reason only looks to the
law and understands none other justice than thobedience of the law. And the
scholemen, like wytty fellows going about to seek out a science in divine
matters, have propouned unto the^ selves the law, even as the philosophers in
Moral matters do propoune unto the^ selves precepts of manners. But Paul
cries out against it, and teaches that justice is an other thing, that is to
were, an obedience toward the promise of reconcilement given for Christ, and
that is, to receive mercy given for Christ. For so be we accepted unto god, so
be the conscience pacifyed, when we feel that god is merciful unto us for
Christ's sake. Wherefore men's minds must be plucked away from the law to the
promise, as we have often times now said, and shall expoune the thing more
largely a little here after, when we shall examine the scholasticall arguments
of the word of ryghtwysenes. An other objection
The adversaries in their confutation cyted also these place of Paul to the
Coloss. against us. Charity is the bond of perfection. upon this they reason
that love justifies because it makes men perfyte. The answer.
Although it may here be answered in sundry wyses of perfection: yet we will
simpely recite the meaning of Paul. Certain it is that Paul speaks of the
love of the neighbor. Nor it is not to be thought that Paul attributes
either justification, or perfection before god, to the works of the second
table, rather than to the works of the first. Furthermore if love be the
perfyte fulfyllyng of the law and satisfyeth the law, the^ we need not
Christ to be our mediator and redemer. But Paul teaches that we be therefore
accepted for Christ and not for the fulfyllyng of the law, because the
fulfyllyng of the law is not perfyte. Wherefore sith in other place as he
manifestly plucketh from us perfection, it is not to be thought that he
speaks here of the personal perfection of every particular person, but
speaks of the comune integrity and unity of the church. For to this intent
he says y^ love is a bond or knyttyng together* because he would signify
unto us that he speaks of the couplyng or knyttyng together of all the members
of the church. For as in all families, in all publyke weals, concord is to
be nouryshed with mutual officies of love, nor tranquillity can not be
retained, onles some little offensies be wynked at and forgyuen: so commands
Paul that in the church be kept love and charity to the reteynyng of
co^corde, and which shall bear otherwhyles (when need requires) the boystous
manners of their brethren, dissemblyng certain lyte offensies, lest the
church run into sundry Schisms and dissensions and of Schisms do rise
hatredes, secres, and heresies. For it can no otherwise be, but that concord
shall be broken, when the bishops do lay on the peoples backs harder burdens
than is expedyent and have no manner regard of the peoples imbecilitye. Also
discordes do rise when the people judges over sharply of the manners of their
teachers, or dispiseth the^ for certain lyte causes, sekinge then an other
kind of doctrine and other teachers. On the contrary side the perfectyon, that
is to say, the entiernes and unity of the church is kept, when the strong
do suffer and bear the weak, when the people takes in worth certain
incommodities which be in the manners of their teachers, when the bishops do
permyt somewhat to the imbecillitie of the people. Of these precepts of
equity, all the books of the wise me^ be full to thend we should remytte and
forgive many things, betwixt our selves in this state of life for a common
tranquillity. And of it, Paul aswele in these place as in many other speaks
and gives commandment. Wherefore thaduersaryes do imprudently fetch forth a
reason out of this word (perfection) that love justifies: sith Paul speaks
here of the common unity and tranquillity. Saint Ambrose
And so Ambrose expouneth this place, whose words be these. Siaut' edificium
dicitum perf^ctum seu integrum, cum omnes parts apt inter seco agmentatae
sunt. Even, quod Ambrose, like as a building is called perfyte or hole when all the parts be aptly framed and co^ioyned together. The uncharitable fashons of
the adversaries.
etc^. It is a shame for the adversaries so hyghly to auaunce love, and so
little at any time to perform it. For what do they now? They disseuer
churches or congregations, they write laws with men's blood, and propowne the^
to the Emperors majesty a prince most mercyful to be promulgate, and
inacted. They kylle prestes and other good men if any do but a little touch
that he does not altogyther allow some manifest abuses. But this agrees not
with such auaunceme^tes and high praises of charity, which if our
adversaries would follow: the churches should be in tranquillity and the
publyke weals in unity and peace. For these tumultes and ruffelinges should
cease, if thaduersaryes would not thus rigorously exact certain traditions
unprofitable to godlynes of which the most part not they them selves do keep
which do most stoutly defend them. They easily pardone them selves, The poet
Horace.
but other they will not so, even as Meuius does in Horace. Egomet mi ignosco
Meuius inquit. I (says Meuius) do forgive mine own self. Undoutedly this
nothing agrees with these noble praises of charytye, which they here cite
out of Paul and understand him no more then the walls understand the voice
that comes unto them. An argument out of saint Peter.4. The answer.
Out of Peter they cite also this sentence Charity hides a multitude of
sinne^. But it is also certain that Peter speaks of the love toward the
neighbor, who applies this place to the precepte in which he commands
men to love each another. Nor truly it could not come to the mind of any of
the Apostles, that our love should overcome sin and death, that our love
should be a purgation for which god should be reconciled, the medyator Christ
omitted, that our love should be ryghtwysnes without the mediator Christ, For
this love, if any there were, should be a justice of the law, and not of the
gospel which promyseth to us reconcilement and ryghtwisnes if we believe that
for Christ our redemer the father be pacifyed and that Christ's merits be our
satisfaction. Therefore Peter a little before byddeth us cum to Christ that we
may be buylt upon Christ, and he adds. who believes in him shall not be
confunded. our love delyuereth us not from confusion, sith god judges and
reproves us, but faith in Christ delyuereth us i^ these affrayes, because we
know that we be pardoned for Christ's sake. How be it this sentence of
charity is taken forth of the proverbs where the circumsta^ce of the place
which renneth in contrarieties does clearly show how it ought to be
understand. Pro. 10.
For there thus is it written. Odium suscitat rixas et vniuersa delicta operit
charitas. i. Hatred styrreth co^tentions, but charity covers al faults.
This sentence teaches even the same self thing that the saying of Paul taken
out of the Collossenses does, which is, if any dissensions fall, they should
be mitigate and pacified by our own indifferency and gentle ^ebauour*
Dissentions, he says, do encreace by* ^a^redes as we often times see that of
very lyte offensies most busynes does rise. There fell certain lyte
displeasures betwixt Gaius Caesar and Pompeius in which if the one had given
place a little to the other, Caesar and Pompey
the civil batell should never have risen. But whiles each of the^ pursued hes
own puate hatred: of a thing of naught rose most grievous troubles. And many
heres^es have risen in the church only of private hatredes of teachers betwixt
them selves. Wherefore when he says ( charity covers offensies) he speaks
not of a man's own offensies but of other men's. as who should say although any
offensies or displeasures do fall yet love dissembleth, wynketh at them,
pardons them, gives place, does not all things with extremity. Peter
therefore means not this, that love before god deserves remission of sins,
that it is a redemption of sins, Christ the mediator excluded, that for
love we be accepted and not for Christ our mediator: but that toward men it
is not disdaynfull, not roughe, not intractable, that it dissembleth the small
offensies of fryndes, and the manners of other, yea though they be somewhat
over boystuous does take the^ in worth, according to the byddyng of a certain
vulgar saying which is this. An old proverb.
Mores amici noueris non oderis.i. Know the manners of thy friend hate them
not. Nor the Apostles do not with out cause so often admonish us of this office
of charity which the philosophers call an Epikee that is to say a moderation
or mitigation. An Epykee.
For this virtue is hyghly necessary to the reteynyng of publyk concord which
can not endure, onles they wynke at much, forgive much each to other as well
the pastors as the congregations.

Out of saint James they cite, An argument out of James the second Chapitre
Videtis igiturque ex operibus iustificatur homo, et non ex fide sola.i. Ye se
then that man is justified by works and not by faith alonly. Nor there is none
other place which seems to make more against our opinion then this does.
Howbeit the answer is easy and plain. If the adversaries would not show unto
it their own opinions of the merits of works, The answer.
saint James words had no incommoditie. But where so ever mention is made of
works the adversaries do add their own wicked gloses, that by good works we
deserve remission of sins, that good works be a raunsum and price for which
god is reconciled unto us, that good works before god for their own goodness
be accepted, nor need not mercy, or Christ to be our mediator. But none of
al these things came in to saint James mind, which all together the
adversaries do now defend, under the pretense of the saying of S. James.
First therefore this is to be weyed and pondered, The first reason or solution.
yt this place rather makes against the adversaries than against us. For the
adversaries teach man to be justified by love and works, but of faith (whereby
we receive our mercystocke Christ) they speak nothing at all, yea rather they
disprove this faith, and disprove it not only with words and sentencies, but
also they go about to put it away with the sword and grievous punyshementes.
How much better teaches James which omitteth not faith, nor puts not
love in the place of faith, but reteyneth it, lest the mercystocke Christ
should be excluded in justification. Like as Paul when he teaches the Su^me
of the christian life, compriseth faith and love, 1. Tim. 1
as when he says. The end of the commandment is charity issuyng out of a
pure heart and good conscience and faith unfeigned. Secondly. The.2. reason.
The matter it self speaks, that here it is spoken of works which ensue
faith and which show that faith is not dead but lyuyshe and workynge in the
heart. Wherefore James meant not that we by good works deserve remission of
sins and grace, for he speaks of the works of them that be justified,
which be already reconciled, accepted, and which have obtained remission of
sins. Wherefore the adversaries err when they out of this place gather that
James teaches us that by good works we have a cu^myng to god, without Christ
the mediator. The.3. reason.
Thyrdly. James a little before spoke of regeneration, that it is made by the
gospel. For thus he says. wyllyngly he generated us by the word of troth
to the end we should be the first fruits or the begynnynges of al his
creatures. When he says that we be regenerate by the gospel, he teaches that
by faith we be regenerate and justified. Thus it appears tha^ James is not
against us, who in blamyng the idle and careless minds which dream that they
have faith and have it not, made a distinction betwixt the dead faith and the
lyuyshe faith. He calls it dead which brings forth no good works. But
he calls that a quycke faith which brings forth good works. Doubtless, we
have oftentimes now showed what we call faith. For we speak not of the idle
knoweledge which is also i^ deuyls, but of the faith which resists the
fearful troubles of the conscience which erecteth and conforteth the feared
hearts. Such faith is neither an easy thing as our adversaries do dream nor
yet in man's power, but a divine power, by which we vaynquyshe the devil and
death, as Paul to the Colossenses says, that faith is mighty by the power
of god and ouercu^meth death. In which ye be, says Paul, resuscitate by
faith which is the might and efficacitie of god. This faith sithe it is a
new life, necessaryly engenders new motions and works. Therefore James does
ryghtly deny that we be justified by such faith which is without works. And
where he says that we be justified by faith and works, suerly he means not
that we be renewed or regenerate by works, nor he means not that partly
Christ is our redemer and partly that our works be our redemption, Nor he
describes not here the manner of iustifycation but he describes what manner of
persons the just be, after they be ones justified and renewed. And this word
( iustificari. i. to be justified) signifies here not to be made of the iniust
just, but after an outward fashion to be pronounced rightwyse* as it is taken
in this saying. Factores legis iustificabuntur.i. The doers of the law shall be
justified. Like therefore as these words have no inconvenience, the doers of
the law shall be justified: so think we of the words of James man is justified
not only by faith but also by works, for undoubtedly men be pronounced just
having faith and good works. For good works in holy men and women as we
said before be iusticies of the law which be accepted because of the faith
and not because they satisfye the law. Men then be justified by faith and
works not because of the works but by cause of the faith which yet good
works must needs follow. For James speaks of tho works which follow
faith, as he witnesses when he says faith helps his works, so we must
take, The doers of the law shall be justified, that is to say, they which
believe and have good fruits be pronounced ryghtwyse. For the law is satisfied
if we believe and it pleases because of the faith, and not because the works
do satisfye the law. Thus we se that in these sentencies is no inconvenience,
but the adversaries deprave and corrupt them addyng their own gloses. For it
is not said that works deserve remission, or that men for their works be
accepted and reputed ryghtwyse before god, and not for Christ, and that the
works do pacify the hearts and ouercum their of god, and that works need not
mercy. None of all these things says saint James which yet the adversaries
asscribe to his words.

Forgive and ye shall be forgyuen. Matthew. 6. Blessed be the merciful, for they
shall obtain mercy. To these sentencies and semblable of works, first we
make this answer, which has be made before, The answer.
that the law is not truly wrought without faith. Neither does it please,
but for faythes sake in Christ / according to that saying of Christ. without
me ye can do nothing, Also, without faith it is impossible to please god,
Also, by Christ we have coming or way to god through faith. Therefore as
often times as works be required and praised, the gospel of Christ is to be
put unto. Secondarily, these textes, which I have a little here tofore recited,
be well nere sermons or preachynges of penance / for they be made of two
parts. They have in the beginning preaching of the law, which rebukes
sin, and commands good works. Afterwade there is added a promise. But
this is most certain and undoubted, that in preaching of repentance, it is
not sufficient to preach the law which does commonly trouble and conde^pne
the conscience. But it is requysite, that preaching of the gospel be added that
sins be freely forgyuen for Christ, and that by faith, we obtain remission
of sins. These things be so certain and so clear, that if our adversaries
would vary from them, and exclude Christ and faith from the preaching of
repentance: they were worthy to be rejected as persons blasphemous against
Christ. Wherefore the sermon of Daniel ought not only to be applied to almose
deades but faith also is to be required in it. The sermon of Daniel is far
unlike the speech of Aristotle, who wryttyng unto his king Alexander,
Aristotle to king Alexandre.
does also exhort him to liberalite, and counseilleth him to use his power to
the comen vtilite and to the wealth of all the people and not to pride. For thus
he wrytteth to Alexander, wherefore assay and endeavor your self to use and
apply your Empiere and dominion not to any contumely or pride but to
munificence and liberalite. For sothe this was a very honest saying and there
could nothing be said better touchi^g the duty of a great prince. But
Daniell instructs and teaches his king not only of his office or calling:
but also of repentance, of love, and devotion toward god / of remission of
sins / and of those great things, which be clean above philosophy. Not
only therefore almouse deades be to be required here: but also faith. And that
the text does declare, where it says that the king was converted, not only
to gyuing of almouse, but much rather to faith. For there remains yet the
excellent confession of that king, and praise of the god of Israel. There is
none other god, which can save in this wise. So then there be two parts of
the sermon of Daniel. The one part is the preaching of repentance, which
rebukes sins and gives monition of a new life saying. Redeame thy sins
with ritghtuousnes, and thy wyckednes with benefits toward y^ pore. The
words of Dani. after the hebraical truth.
For so speaks Daniell in his own tongue, where it appears sufficiently,
that he gives not only instruction of alms deeds: but of all justice.i. of
the knowledge of god, and faith. For he says Redeem thy sines by righteousness.
Now justice toward god is faith, by which we believe, y^ god forgyueth us.
Afterward Daniel gives i^struction of benifites toward pore men, which is
that he should not govern proudly nor cruelly but provide, and dilige^ly se for
the profetes of his subjects / the other part of his sermon promyseth
remission of si^nes. Lo thy sines shall be healed Hierome here besides y^ purpose
puttith to a dubitatiue particle (forsita^) and much more unwisely he
disputes in his commentaries, Hieroms t^anslatyon rejected.
that remission of sins is uncertain. But let us remember, that the gospel
undoubtedly promyseth remission of si^nes. And he is to be judged to disannull
and abrogate the gospel, whosoever thinks that remission of si^nes is
uncertain. Let us therefore not regard Hierome in this place. Now for as much
as here is a promise evidently put, doubtless faith is required for a promise
can not be received but by faith. Howbeit eue^ there also he shows y^
remission might chance, when he says. Redeem thy si^nes. And this promise of
remission of sins is a very prophetical, and an euangelical sentence, which
doutles Daniel would to be received by faith. For Daniel knew that remission of
si^nes was promised for the sede that was to come (that is to wit) Christ, and
that not only to the Israelites, but also to al nations. For else he could not
have promised to the king remissyon of sins. For it belongs not to man,
namely in the affrayes of sin, to decre, and determyne of the will of god
without some assured word of god, that he will cease to be angry. Therefore
sith here is a promise put, it appears sufficiently, that faith is required,
for a promise ca^ not be received but by faith. If these faith should depend
upon the condition of works, then were remissyon uncertain. Therefore such
manner faith is required which does trust on the mercy of the word of god, and
not upon our own works. And where he says. Redeem thy sins by justice: and
by alms deades. It is as much as if he had said, Redeem thy sins by
repentance. For by penance or repentance the gylte is taken away. Neither
is it to be reasoned here of, that god does forgive for works following but
he forgyueth because of his promise, such persons as do receive hes promise.
We have showed plainly, that i^ the oration of Daniel faith is required,
wherefore they do injury to this place, who so ever do conclude thereof that
remission of sins comes for our own works, and not by faith for Christ's
sake. It is a philosophical point, in the sermon of Daniel to require nothing
but an exhortation of gouernynge his Empyere well, and it is a pharisa^call
point, to feign unto it, that for that self work remyssyon of sins does
come. But thus it comes to pass works naturally do run into men's eyes, for
man's reason neither perceyueth, neither consydereth faith, and therefore it
dreameth that those works deserve remission of sins. This opinion naturally
cleaves in the minds of men, and can not be shaken of, oneles we be other
wise taught by the word of god. We ought to call our selves back from this
carnal opinion to the gospel and to the promise of mercy, in which is freely
exhibited remission of sins for Christ's sake. So in all places of penance,
faith is r^^uisite. For it were most high injury against Christ to seek
remission of sins without Christ. Some men do interpret Daniel to speak of
remission of pain, when he says. Redeem thy sins with almose. Admyt it were
taken so, yet Daniell should make nothing against us, how be it, it is no
doubt, but that he speaks of the remission of the sin. For the remission of
ponyshement is sought in vain, onles the heart first by faith has received
remission of the sin. Now if they will grant, that remission of the syn
comes freely by faith: We will afterward not stick to grant them that
the pains or ponishementes wherewith we be chastised be mitigated and aswaged
with good works, and with hole repentance according to ye saying of Paul. If
we would judge our owneselues, doutles we should not be judged of the lord.

Forgive and ye shall be forgyuen. For it is well nere a like sermon of
repe^tau^ce. The first part requires good works. The latter part adds
and puts to a promise, nether it is to be resoned, that our forgeuinge of
our neighbor, by the virtue of the warke wrought does deserve that our
synnnes be forgyuen us, for Christ does not say so. But like wise as to other
sacraments Christ ioynith and knitteth to a promise of remission of sins:
even so does he also knitte a promise to good works. And like wise as in the
supper of the lord we obtain not remissyon of si^nes without faith by the
very work that is wrought: even so no more do we in these work, yea the
forgyuinge of our neighbor is no good work, but when it is done of them which
be reconciled. Therefore our forgiving, which is acceptable and pleasant to
god, follows gods forgiuynge. Now Christ is wont after such sort to
join together the law, and the gospel, that he does teach both two, I
mean the doctrine of faith and the doctrine of good works, to thend he should
admonish us that it is but hypocrisy and a faynynge of repentance, onles good
fruits do follow also, to thentent we might have many outward signs of the
gospel, and of remission of sins, which should put us in rememberaunce, and
comfort us, and y^ we might many ways exercise faith. After this wise
therefore it is necessary to understand such places, lest we should abrogate
the gospel of Christ and plead our works against God as a ransom and
price reiectynge Christ, Also lest remissyon of sins be made uncertain, if
it be taught to hang upon the condition of our works. There is alleged also
this text out of Tobie. An argument out of Tobi.
Almose deed delyuereth from all manner sin and death. We will not call this
an hyperbolicall or excessive manner of speakinge how be it, it ought so to be
taken that it plucketh nothing away from the dew praises of Christ, whose
proper benefits and office is, to deliver from sin and death. But we must
have recourse to this rule, that the law without Christ avails not. Those
almoses therefore please god, which follow reconciliation and not those which
go before. So then they deliver from sin and death, not by the virtue of the
work that is wrought, but (as we said a little here to fore of repentance,
that we ought to join faith with fruits) so like wise it is to be judged of
almose deades that faith with the fruits pleases. For Tobie preaches not only
of almose deeds, but also of faith saying. At all times bless god, and desyer
of him to direct thy ways. But this thing properly belongs to the faith
whereof we speak which feleth god gracious and favorable for hes own mercy
and desires that he will keep and govern us. Besides this we grant* that
almose deeds do merit many benefytes of god, and deliver not from the sin
that is present (for they over come not the wrath and judgment of god nether
make they quiet the consciences) but they deliver from sin that is to come, I
mean they do merit yt we may be defended in the perilles of sins, and death
This is the simple understanding agreyng to the other scriptures. For always
the prases of warkes and of the law be so to be understood and taken, that
they do not mynyshe the glory of Christ and of the gospel. An other objection
The saying also of Christ is alleged out of the gospel of Luke. Give ye
almose, and lo all thyn^es be clean unto you. Undoutedly our aduer^aryes be
stark deeffe, The solution.
so often times has it ben said, yt the law without Christ does not avail,
for whose sake good warkes do please, and be accepted. But they in all places
excludynge Christ, teach that the warkes of the law deserve iustifycation.
This place if it be brought forth hole and perfect shall show that faith
also is required. For Christ rebukes the pharisees, which thought the^ selves
to be made clean in the sight of god, that is to say, to be justified by
their often washinges, even as a certain byshope of Rome shows of holy water
that it sanctifyeth and cleanses the people. And the gloss says, that it
cleneth from venial sins. Such were also the opinions of the Pharisees
which Christ reprehendeth, and he sets against this feigned purgatyon two
manner of clennes the one inward the other outward, he byddeth that they
should be made clean inwardly and adds concerning outward clennes. Give in
almose of your superfluity and abundance, and so all things shall be clean
unto you. Our adversaries do not ryghtly apply this partycle or sign
universal ( omnia) for Christ adds this conclusyon to both members. Then
all thing shall be clean to you, that is to wit, if ye shall be clane
inwardly, and shall give almose outwardly. For he sygnifyeth, that outward
clennes is to be set in the warkes commanded by god, and not i^ the
traditions of men, as then were tho often wasshinges, and now a days is the
daily sprinclyng of holy water, the habites of religious persons (as they be
called) the deuersite and choice of metes and like pompes. But our adversaries
do corrupt the sentence with sophistry translatynge the universal perticle
to the one part alone. All things shall be clean to you if ye give almose, as
if a man should make these reason. S Andrewe is present, go all the Aposteles be
present. Wherefore in the antecedente both members ought to be joined together
in this wise. Believe and give almose so all things shall be clean to you. For
the scripture says in another place, that the hearts be purifyed by faith.
That if the hearts be cleansed, and afterward almose deeds be put to outwardly,
that is to say, almanner works of charity: so shall they be clean al
together, that is for to say not only within, but also without. And that hole
sermon of Christ ought to be joined together, of which there be many parts,
whereof certain do teach of faith and certain of warkes. And it is no
property of a good reader to pycke out the precepts of warkes. leuynge out the
places of faith. There be some also which do interpret it to be an Ironicall
locution. Give ye almose, and all things be cleave unto you. For Christ
seems dryly to check the vain persuasion of the phariseis, which when they
had their minds laden with most lewd affections, yet in the mean season
because they gave almose thought the^ selves to be half gods. This
interpretatyon is not unmeet, neither has it any thing in it self dissonante
or contrary to the other scriptures. We would put to also other places but that
we think, that by these places which we have rehearsed and declared, all other
like may easily be judged. But we shall yet add this scolastical argument. A
scholastical argument.
Ryghtuousnes must needs be in the will, go faith, which is in the
understanding does not iustifye. This argument we do therefore rehearse that ye
hole matter might be made more plain, how faith does iustifye, and what Paul
does call iustifycatyon. The answer.
And first because of certain wayward persons, we shall answer artificiously.
These is plain in moral philosophy that justice is called obedyence toward
the superior, such as he accepts and allows. But faith is an obedyence
toward the gospel. Wherefore faith is ryghtly called justice, for obedience
toward the gospel is imputed, and rekened for ryghtuousnes, in somuche that
obedyence toward the law only, does therefore please, because we believe, that
god is freely gracious and louinge to us for Christ's sake, for we do never
satisfye the law. Now although this faith be in the will (for it is to will,
and to receive the promise) yet never theles this obedyence toward the gospel
is not for our clennes imputed for ryghtuousnes, but because it receives the
mercy that is offered, and thinks that we be reputed ryghtuous for Christ's
sake by mercy, and not for our own fulfylling of the law, nor for our own
clennes. So the mind is to be called away from gasynge on the law unto the
gospel and unto Christ, and we must assure our selves that we be reputed
ryghtuous, when we do think our own selves to be accepted for Christ's sake,
and not for our own love, or for our own fulfyllynge of the law. A
difference betwixt faith and hope.
And faith differs from hope, for faith receives at these present time
remissyon of sins, and reco^ciliation, or acceptatyon of our own selves, for
Christ's sake. But hope is busye about the good things that be to come, and
about delyueraunce to come. Secondarely, Iustifycation here in these place
signifies to be reputed rightuous. An other of y^ scholastical argument.
Now god does not repute a man ryghtuous, after the manner that a man is
reputed ryghtuous in the corte of causes, or in philosophi, for the justice of
his own warkes, which may well be put in the will. But he reputeth a man
ryghtuous by mercy for Christ's sake, so that a man do receive him by faith.
Wherefore faith may be called Justice, for it is that thing, which is imputed
to righteousness (as paul is wont to speak) in what so ever part of man it be
put. For that does nothing at all let gods imputatyon, how be it we do put
this faith in the will of man, for it is to will and to receive the promise of
Christ. And this scolasticall argument thus debated because it dryueth the
matter to an art, the hole cause seems much the better to be perceived. By
(...) these things it may be also perceived what is to be judged de merito
condigni that is to wit of the merit of worthynes, of which our adversaries
do feign, that men be ryghtuous in the sight of god for their own love and
fulfyllynge of the law. Here is no mention at al made of the justice of faith
and in the stead of Christ the mediator, is put that we be accepted for our
fulfyllynge of the law. These things are in no wise sufferable, but (as we
said before) though love follows renouatio^, yet may not the glory of Christ
be taken from him and given to our fulfyllynge of the law, but it is to be
thought that even after the renouation also, we be accounted just for Christ's
sake and that Christ remains still a mediator and mercy stock and that by the
means of Christ and for him we have coming and enter to the father, and that
we do not satysfie the law but that we have always need of mercy and that we
be always compted just for mercy. And this thing does the hole church
confess that we be made ryghtwyse and saved through mercy as we have
heretofore recyted forth of Saint Jerome. Saint. Hierome
Our ryghtuousnes is not for our own merit but comes of the mercy of god.
But so it is that this mercy is received by faith, go. etc^. The inconvenience
^ hiche ensues of thaduersaries opinion.
But se I pray you what inconvenience ensues of the opinion of our adversaries
if it should be thought that Christ did only merit the first grace or
favor (as they call it) and afterward we be accepted for our own
fulfyllinge of the law, and do deserve eternal life: when shall conscyencies
be quiet? when shall they be assured that they have the favor of god? for the
law always accuses us as Paul sayeh. Lex ira^ operatur, the law works
wrath. So shall it come to pass that if the conscience shall feel the
judgment of the law, they shall run in to desperatyon. Paul says. All
that ever is not of faith is sin. But these persons will never work any
thing by faith: if they should never think them selves to have god gracyous
and louinge unto the^ but when they have fulfilled the law, yea rather they
shall evidently perceive that they have not satisfied it. And therefore they
shall never determyne within them selves that they have gods favor and that
their prayer is hard* and consequently they shall never love, they shall never
truly worship god. Such manner of hearts and minds what other thing be
they, but very hell it self? sith they be full of desperatyon and of the
hatred of god, and yet in this hatred they do call upon god and do worshype god
as Saul did worship him. Here we provoke and appele to godly minds and
skylled of spiritual things. Saul.
These can testifye that those foresaid evyls ensue of that ungodly persuasyon
of our adversaries who think that we be reputed just in the sight of god for
our own fulfyllinge of the law and bydde us not trust in the promise of
mercy freely given for Christ's sake but rather in our own fulfyllyng of the
law. It is therefore expedient to determyne with our selves that undoubtedly
after renewinge, we be rightwise or acceptable to god and y^ we have peace in
y^ sight of god through mercy for Christ, and also that such inco^plete
beginning of the law in us: is not worthy of eternal life, but that like wise
as remission of sins and iustifycation is imputed through mercy for Christ
and not for the law: even so eternal life with justification is offered not
for the law and for the perfection of our works but through mercy for
Christ's sake, as christ him self says. This is the will of my father who
has sent me: that every one which seth the son, and believes in him shall
have everlasting life. But let us inquire of our adversaries what counsel
they give unto them that be at the point of death, whether they do bydde them
think that they be compted just and to look after everlasting life for their
own works, or else for the mercy of god for Christ's sake? Certes nether Paul
nether Laure^ce will say that they are to be compted ryghtuouse for their own
clennes, or that everlasting life is to the^ due for their own works or
fulfyllynge of the law, but they will think them selves to be reputed just and
to receive eternal life for Christ's sake through mercy. Nether can godly
minds be armed against desperation onles they think that through mercy for
Christ's sake, they have assuredly both ryghtuousnes and everlasting life, and
not for the law. These sentence comfort, sets up, and saves godly
minds. Wherefore thaduersaryes when they auaunce and extolle meritum
condigni.i. the merit of worthynes they quyte put away y^ doctrine of faith
and of the medyator Christ and drive conscience to desperation. A question
But some happily will say if we are to be saved by mercy: what diversity is
there betwyrt them to who^ salvation chaunseth, and them to whom it does not
chance? Shall both good men and bad me^ egally hope and trust after mercy? This
argument seems to have moved the schole men to seek meritum condigni.i. the
merit of condignitie or worthynes. For there must needs be some diversity
betwixt those that shall be saved and those that shall be dampened. The solution.
And first of all we say, that with iustifycation is offered everlasting
life, or that they which are justified be the sons of god and coinheritours
with Christ, according to this saying of Paul. Whom he has iustyfyed the
same he has also gloryfyed. Therefore saluatyon chances to none, save to
those that be justified. And likewise as iustifycation should be uncertain if
it did ha^ge upon the condition of our works, or of the law, and were not
freely received for Christ's sake, through mercy: So if hope did leave to our
works, then in deed it should be uncertain, because the law does always
accuse conscience. Nether can there be any hope of eternal life except the
conscience be at peace and rest. For the conscience that is in doubt, fl^eth
the judgment of god and despayreth, but it is necessary that the hope of
eternal life be certain and undoubted, and therefore that it may be undoubted and
certain we must think that everlasting life is given freely through mercy
for Christ's sake, and not for our own fulfyllyge of the law. In courts, and
in the judgments of men, right or deuty is for the most part certain and
undoubted, but the mercy of the Judge is uncertain. But here in the sight of
god the thing is far otherwise, for mercy has the plain and evident
commandment of god, for the gospel is that same commandment, which
byddeth us believe that god is wyllinge to forgive, and to save us for Christ's
sake, according to that saying of Christ. God has not sent his son into the
world, to judge the world: but that the world should be saved by him,
whosoever believes in him is not judged. As often times therefore as mention is
(...) of mercy, it is to be vnderstonde^ that faith is required. And this
faith makes the ^^^erence betwixt them that shall be saved, and them that
shall be dampened, between them that ^e worthy* and them that be unworthy. For
eternal life is promised to the^, that be justified. And faith justifies
whenever men do receive it. And we ought to labor and strive, al our live
long, that we may get and establyshe this faith, for these faith (as we have
said before) is won in repentance, and not in the^, which walk after ye
flesh* And it ought to increase al our life long among ieoperdies and
temptations. And whosoever have gotten this faith, those be borne again that
they may work well, and that they may do the law. Therefore likewise as we
require repentance through out all our life time: so we do also re^uyre good
works, all though our works be not such, that for them eternal life is
due, likewise as Christ said in like sentence. When ye have done all things,
say we be unprofitable servants. Saint. Barnard
And Barnarde says right well thus. It is necessary first to believe, that
thou can not have remission of sins, but by the only indulgence and pardon
of god. Secondarily, that thou can have no manner good work at all onles it
also be freely given unto y^. And a little after he says. Let no man therefore
begile him self, for if he will consider well, he shall find with out doubt,
that he is not able to go forth, with ten thousand, against him which
comes to him with twenty thousand. etc. We therefore to thentent that
consciences should retain a sure and undoubted consolation and hope: do call men
back again to the promise of Christ, and do teach, that it is necessary to
believe, that god for Christ's sake, and not for the law, does forgive sins,
does iustifye, and does give eternal life, according to that saying. Who so
ever has the son, has life. But it is a world to hear how our adversaries
do dally, and elude these saying of Christ. When ye have done all things, yet
say ye, we be unprofitable servants. In the confutatyon, thus they corupt it,
first they go about to confound us with our own reason by a form of argument
which is called antistrephon in this manner. An argument which they call
antistrephon.
If when we have done al things we must say, we be unprofytable saruauntes,
go, much rather when we have believed all things we may say that we be
unprofitable servants. Mark I pray you how greatly our adversaries be
delyted in vanities and in chyldishe sophistry. But albeit these folyshe
trifles be not worthy to be refuted and dysproued: yet nevertheless we shall
make answer to them in few words. Their argument called antystrephon is
vicious and nothing worth. The answer and solutio^ of their argument.
For our adversaries be deceived in this word (faith) which if it betokened
the knowledge of the historye, or if we had said that faith of her own
worthiness had saved: then should the symylytude be of much more strength that
we be unprofitable servants though we had believed. But we do speak of the
faith and trust of the promise and of the mercy of god. And this faith does
grant that we be unprofitable servants, yea this is the very voice and
saying of faith, that our works be unworthy and that we be unprofitable
servants. And for this only cause we speak of faith, and seek mercy:
because we knowledge our selves to be unprofitable servants. For faith does
therefore save, because it receives mercy, or the promise of grace, all
though our works be unworthy. And after this understanding, the antystrephon
does nothing hurt us, when ye shall have believed all things, yet say ye we
be unprofitable servants, it is well said, if it be only vnderstonded, that
worthynes is taken from works. But again on the contrary side, if it be thus
vnderstonded, that faith also is unprofitable: then the symilitude is nothing
worthy, to say when ye shall have done al things: do not trust to your
works: So when ye shall have believed, do not trust the promise of god. These
things do not agree together, for they be very fare unlike, Unlyke causes,
unlike obiectes of confydence and trust be in the first proposytion, and in
the latter. Trust in the first proposytion, is the trust of our own works.
Trust in the latter proposytion is the trust of gods promise. Nome Christ
condempneth confydence and trust in our own works, but he does not disalowe
the trust in his own promise, he wyllith not that we despair of the grace and
mercy of god, he rebukes our warkes as unworthy but he rebukes not the
promise which freely offers mercy. And Ambrose speaks excedyngly well in
these point, thus. Grace is to be known, Sainte-Ambrose
but nature is not to be known, we must trust to the promise of grace, and
not to our nature. But our adversaries follow there accustomed manner. The
ungracious wrestyng of the adversaries
They do ungraciously wrest the sentence that makes for faith, against the
doctrine of faith. For this cauillation does abrogate the gospel to say* when
ye shall have believed all things, say that faith is unprofitable. Does not
the gospel promise remission of sins, and salvation even unto them which
have no good works at all so that they will be converted and not despair, but
by faith in Christ obtain remission of sins? Do our adversaries bydde them
despair whose consciences find no good warkes, which they may plede against
the judgment of god? Will they say unto the^, that faith is unprofitable? God
give these sophisters a myschefe with such cauillations which do subuerte the
hole gospel which do abrogate the free remyssyon of sins, which do take
away from godly conscyences ferme and sure consolatyons. A childishe
cauillation.
But that cauillatyon among other is utterly childishe where as they
interpret the servants to be unprofitable because the works be unprofitable
to god, but profitable to us. But Christ speaks of y^ utility and profet
which makes god dettour to us of grace. Howbeit it is beside the purpose,
here in this place: to dispute of utility or inutilitie. For unprofitable
servants betoken insufficient or unable servants, for no man fears god so
much, no man loves so much, no man believes or trusts god so much as he
ought to do / no man fulfilleth the law. But let us now pass over these
vain cauillations of our adversaries of which how men will judge, if at any
time they shall be brought forth in to light. Wise men may easily guess. In
words most plain and evident, they have found a starri^g hole. But who
sees not, that in this place is re^uked the confidence and trust of our own
works? An other obiectiv.
But our adversaries do cry against us, that eternal life is due of worthynes
for our own god works / because eternal life is called a reward. We will
make a short and a plain answer. The solution.
Paul calls eternal life a gift, because when we be reputed ryghtuous for
Christ's sake, we be also made the sons of god and coinheritours with Christ.
But in another place it is written. Plentuous shall your reward be in heaven. If
our adversaries do think that the^e things be repugnaunte the one to the
other: let them selves dissolve the doubt. But they be none indifferent
judges. For they leave out this word (gift) they leave out also the
fountaynes of the hole busynes (that is to say) in what wise men be justified
/ and that Christ is contynually a Mediator. In the mean season they pycke
out this word (reward) And that they do most bytterly interpret not only
against the scripture, but also against the custom and usual manner of
speaking. Hereof they reason, because it is called reward, that therefore our
works are such which ought to be the price, for which eternal life is dew.
Uerely this is a new kind of logyke. We hear these word (reward) ergo our
works do satisfy and fulfill the law? Ergo we be accepted to god for our own
works, and need not the mercy of Christ the propitiatour, or faith receiui^g
mercy? And they cumulate a great heap of arguments one upon another, after
the manner of Chrysippus. Good works be the price, for which eternal life is
due. Good works do satisfy the la^e of god. And besides, there may be done
^orkes of superogation: Therefore men may not only satisfy and fulfill the law
of god, but also do more the^ fulfill it. Monks and Frears.
And because Monks and Freers do more than fulfill the law, therefore they have
merits more then they need them selves. And because it is liberalalite to give
unto other of that which thou haste above thine own necessity: therefore they
may give those merits to other men. They devise also a sacrament (that is to
say) a wytnes and a mark of this gyuyng, for when men be dead they put about
them the habites of their relegious men, to witness that other men's merits be
applied unto them. With such coaceruatio^s our adversaries do deface the
benefit of Christ, and the justice of faith.

We do not here raise up vain pratyng about the word: But we strive about a
great thing (that is to we^e) whereof godly minds ought to conceive sure and
undoubted hope of salvation, whether good works may set consciences at peace
and quyetnes? Whether they ought to think, that eternal life is so gotten if
they do set their good works against the judgment of god, orels they ought
to think that through mercy for Christ's sake they be reputed ryghtous, and do
obtain eternal life? These things do come into controversy, which onle^
the conscience do discuss and judge: it can not have any strong and sure
consolation. But we have declared evidently enough. that good works do not
satisfy the law of god but that they have need of mercy, and that by faith
we be accepted with god for Christ's sake, also that good works do not set the
conscience at rest and peace. Of all these things it follows, that we ought
to think, that for Christ's sake through mercy, and not for the law, they
that be justified, do obtain eternal life. The words of merit and reward.
What shall we say then as touching the name of reward? First if we should
say, that eternal life is called a reward, because it is due to them that be
justified by reason of the promise: we should not speak any thing amysse. For
these gifts be ordered among the^ selves, as Augusti^ne says. Dona sua
coronat deus in nobis.i. God crowns and rewards his own gifts in us. But
the scripture calls eternal life a reward, not because it is due for our
works: but because it does recompense the affections and works, albeit yet
it is given for another cause. Likewise as the inheritance comes to the good
man's son of the house not for his own works or service: and yet nevertheless
it is a reward and reco^pense of the warkes and service of the son. It is
sufficient therefore that the name of reward does for this cause agree to
eternal life, be cause eternal life does recompense good works and
afflictions. Eternal life therefore is not a reward, because our works be
sufficient, or because it is due for works: but consecutiuely, because
although it be due for another cause, yet nevertheless it does recompense good
works and afflictions.

Besides this we do grant, that works be in very deed meritorious, not of
remission of sins, or of justification, for works do not please but in the^,
that be justified, and that because of faith. Neither be they worthy of
eternal life. For as justification comes by faith for Christ's sake, so
does viuificatio^, but they be meritorious of other rewards corporal, and
spiritual, which are given partly in this life, and partly after these life.
For god differreth the most part of his rewards until he does glorify
saints after this life / because he will that they be excercised in this life
to mortifye the old man. The gospel does freely set forth and exhibete the
promise of justification and vivification for Christ's sake. But in the law
reward is offered and is due, not freely, but for works. For as much therefore
as works be a certain fulfyllyng of the law: they be well called
meritorious, and it is well said, that reward is due unto them And this
reward engendereth degrees of rewards, according to that saying of Paul.
Every man shall receive reward according to his own labor. These degrees be
reward of warkes, and of afflictions. But our adversaries do contend, and
styffly affirm that eternal life is only due for works, because Paul
says. He shall render to every man according to his work. In the fyfthe of
Johan. who so ever have wrought well shall rise again to the resurrection of
l^fe. In the.xxv. of Mathewe. I was hungry and ye gave me meat. In all these
places, in which works be commended and praised, it is necessary to have
recourse to the rule a bo^^remembred (that is to say) that works please not
without Christ, nor that Christ the mediator is not to be excluded. Wherefore
when the text says, that eternal life is given to warkes: It means that it
is given to them that be justified. For good works do not please god but in
them that be justified (that is to say) in them, which think them selves
accepted to god for Christ's sake. And they that be justified, do necessarily
bring forth good works, or good fruits, as. I was hungry and ye gave me
meat. Here when it is said, that eternal life is given to these works, the
meaning is that it is given to ryghtuousnes. Therefore he co^prehendeth faith
when he names the fruits. And the scripture names the fruits, to show that
god requires not hypochrisy but justice which is full of efficacitie and
workyng, and a certain new life bringing forth good fruits. Neither do we
covet here any vain or vnfrutful subtilite. For they be very wayghty causes
for which we do dispute these things For if we do grant to our adversaries,
that works do deserve eternal* life: anon they add these false and
inconueniente things that works satisfy the law of god, that they have no
need of mercy, that we be ryghtuous, that is to say acceptable in the sight of
god for our own works, and not for Christ's sake* that men may do more then
fulfill the law. So all the doctrine of the justice of faith, is quyte
overthrown. And undoubtedly it is necessary that the pure doctrine of the
justice of faith be reserved in the church. Wherefore we be compelled to rebuke
the phariseicall opinions of our adversaries / both to the intent that we may
set forth the glory of Christ, and also that we may set forth unto
consciences ferme and sure comfortes. For how shall the conscience conceive
certain hope of salvation, when it shall perceive, that in the judgment of
good works be unworthy? Onles it knows, that men be reputed ryghtuous and
saved through mercy, for Christ's sake, and not for our own fulfyllyng of the
law. Did S. Laurence lyeng on the grydyron think, that through ye work he
satisfied the laweof god? and that he was void of syn, and neded not Christ
the Mediator, nor the mercy of god? No verily, he was (I am sure) of the ^ame
mind that the prophet was of, which said Lord enter not into judgment with
thy servant, for no living creature shall be justified in thy sight. saint
Barnarde confesses, that his own works be not worthy eternal life, Barnard
when he says, I have lived wretchedly. But he comfort him self, and
gathers hope of salvation hereof, because he perceyueth that for Christ's
sake through mercy is given remission of sins, and eternal* life, as the
Psalm teaches which says. Blessed be they, whose iniquities be forgiven.
And Paul says / David callith ye man blessed, to whom god imputes
ryghtuousnes without works. Paul says, that he is blessed, to who^
ryghtuousnes is imputed by faith in christ although he have no good works.
With such co^solations be consciences to be comforted and strengthed, that is
to say, that for Christ's sake by fathe is gotten remission of sins,
reputation of justice, and eternal life. Now if in these places of works,
faith after this manner shall be understand: they hurt no thing our sentence or
opinion. And verily it is necessary always to put to, faith: that we do not
exclude the Mediator Christ. And good works ought to follow faith because
faith without good works is hypochrisye. They have also in the schools
certain propre and short sayenges agreing to our sentence of which sort be
these / that good works do please god, because of grace and favor. Also,
Apopheg matascho lastica.
that we must trust to the grace of god. These sayenges they do not well
interpret. For the old writers did mean, that we must trust to grace (that
is to wete) to the mercy of god promysyng, that for Christ's sake we be
accepted. But the writers of later time have translated this trust to our own
work. Their opinion is, that we must trust to grace, that is to wete, to the
love, where with we love god This is a false and a corrupt interpretation. For
we ought not to trust to our own love, forasmuch as it is unclean and small,
but to the promise of mercy. This is also a common saying a monge them, that
good works be of strength by the virtue of Christ's passion / it is well said,
but there ought to have been made mention of faith in these sentencies. For the
merit of Christ's passion is not communicate ^o us, onles we do receive it by
faith / and do set it against the terrors of syn and death. For Paul says
/ Christ is a propitiatio^ by faith. Also the church in all prayers or
collec^es adds at the end. Per dominum nostrum Iesum Christum. that is to
say. By our lord Jesus Christ. Here also men are to be monyshed and to be put
in remembrance of faith. For the church means, that our works and our
prayers do plese god, if we do believe that god is gracious, for Christ's sake /
the high bishop. Let these things suffice at this time concerning this
place. And we do know, that this sentence and opinion which we defend, is
consonau^te and agreing to the gospel, and does bring most strong and sure
consolations to godly consciences. Therefore let not godly consciences suffer
them selves to be led away from this sentence and opinion, for cause of the
unjust false and sclaunderous judgments of our adversaries. For the
scripture ^ophecieth that the time should come when (...) teachers should play
mastries in the chur^^e* which oppressing the justice of faith in Christ
should teach to merit remission of sins by our own obseruau^ces and
works. And the things done in Israel be an image and figure of the state that
should afterward follow in the church. Now we do se that the prophets do
euerywhere rebuke this persuasion of the people, which did dream, that they
did merit forgyuenes of sins by the sacrifices of the law, and by the
reason of these opinion did heap works upon works, and sacrifices upon
sacrifices. So in the church there be many persons, which have a false
persuasion of their own works and ceremonies. But the scripture has taught
us, that we should not be troubled with the multitude of wicke^ and ungodly
persons, and yet it is no mastrie to judge the spirit of our adversaries. For
we do se that in many of their articles the manifest and open truth is
condemned by them. And let not this trouble or offend any man, that they do
challenge and take upon them selves the name of the church. For the church of
Christ is among them which do teach ye gospel truly: and not among the^
which do defend wrong opinions against the gospel / as the lord says. My
sheep do hear my voice.

Of the Church.
THe seventh article of our confession they dampne in which we said, The.vii.
article of the confession.
that the church is a congregation of saints or holy me^. And they make a
long process, that evil persons are na^ to be segregate or divided from the
church, sithe that Johan Baptist co^^pared the church to the flower of the
Barn^ in which both corn and chafe be laid together on an heap. ^ that is
y^ church.
And Christ compared it to a net in which be caught both good fysshes and
badde. Without doubt, it is a true said proverb. Against the biting of a
sycophaunt or sclau^derer there is no remedy. Nothing can be spoken so
circumspectly but that a captious sclaunderer shall find occasion to deprave
it. We, even for this very cause did add the eight article least any man
should think that we severed the evil persons and hypocrites from the
outward society of the church, or plucked away the virtue from the
sacraments which be ministered by hypocrites and evil men. Wherefore here
needs no long defense against this sclaunder. The eight article does
sufficently purge us. For we grant that hypocrites and evil men be in this
life mixed in the church and be members of the church, as touching the
outward society of the signs of the church, that is to wete, of the word,
profession, and sacraments namely if they be not excommunicate. Nor the
sacraments be not therefore without virtue because evil men minister them, or
evil men receive them. For Paul prophecieth that the time should come when
Antichrist should sytte in the temple of god, that is to say, should have
dominion and bear officies in the church. But the church is not only a
society of externe things and rites, as other polecies or civil societies
be, but principally it is a society of faith and of the holy ghost in men's
hearts, which yet natwithsta^dyng has outward notes and tokyns whereby it may
be known as the sincere and pure teaching of the gospel, and the ministration
of the sacraments agreeable to the Euangel of Christ. And this church only is
called the body of Christ, which, Christ with his spirit renews,
sanctifyeth, and governs, as testifyeth Paul saying. And him he made head
above al, of the church which is his body, that is to say, an entiertie or
the hole congregation of him which works all together in all men. Wherefore
they in whom Christ does nothing work, be not members of Christ. And this
confess the adversaries that the evil persons be dead me^bres of the
church. Wherefore we wonder why they rebuked our description which speaks of
the quick members. Nor it is no new thing that we bring in. Paul's definition.
Paul defyneth the church in like wise where as he says, that it is
purified, to the end it might be holy. And he adds these outward tokyns,
the word and the sacraments. Ephe. 5.
For thus he says. Christ loved the church and gave him self for it, to
sanctify it, purifieng it with the bathe of water, by the word, to the end he
might exhibit it unto him self a glorious church, not having any spotte or
wrynkle or any such thing but that it be holy and inculpate. This sentence we
did put in the confession almost word for word. Thus also the article of
the Creed does defyne the church, which hyd us believe that there is a
catholic church. But the wicked men be not the holy church. And the article
following which is Sanctorum communionem the communion of saynctes seem to be
added for an exposicion to show what the church is (that is to say) a
congregation of holy persons which be fellows and partakers of the same
gospel, of the same doctrine and of the same holy ghost which renews
sanctifyeth and governs their hearts. And these article is propouned for a
necessary cause we se infinite perils, which do manasse destruction of the
church. Infinite is the multitude of the wicked in the church which oppress
it. Wherefore lest we should despair, and to the intent we should know that
the church at least ways shall remain, and because we should know that (be
the multitude of the wicked never so great) yet the church stands, and
Christ perfourmeth his promises to the church, and remitteth sins, hereth,
and gives the holy ghost: this article of the Creed propouneth unto us these
consolations. Why the church is called catholic.
And it names it a catholyk church lest we should understand the church to be
an outward congregation of some certain nation, where as it sygnifyeth rather
men disparsed through out the world which agree in the gospel and have al one
Christ, al one holy ghost, The Gloss.
and the same sacraments, whether they have like traditions of man or unlike.
And the gloss in the decrees says, that the Church largely taken compriseth
both good and evil. Moreover, that evil men be of the Church only in name
and not in deed: but the good both in deed and in name, In this sentence be
many things red of the fathers. For Ierom says: Hierome.
who therefore is a sinner maculate with any spotte, can not be said of the
church of Christ, nor subject to Christ. Wherefore although hypocrites and
evil men be fellows of this true church according to externe rytes: yet when
the church is defined, we must needs define that which is the living body
of Christ, and which is the church both in name and in de^e. And that for
many causes, first it is necessary to be known what thing does principally
make us members and lyuishe members of the Church. But if we should only
define the church to be an externe polecie of good and evil, men shall not
understand that the kingdom of Christ is the justice of the heart, and a
gyuynge of the holy ghost, but shall judge it only to by an outward kepi^g of
certain rytes and ceremonies. Moreover what diversity shall there be betwyxte
the people of the law and the church, if the church be an outward policy*
But Paul does so discern the church from the people of the law, yt he
calls the church a spiritual people, that is to say, distinct not by cyuyle
rytes from the ge^tyles, but the true people of god regenerate by the holy
ghost. But in the people of the law beside the promise made of Christ / also
the carnal sede had promises of corporal things, of a kingdom. etc. And for
these promyses the Jews were called the people of god, not only the good, but
also they which among them were evil. For god severed this carnal sede from
the rest of the gentyles by certain externe ordinances and promyses. And yet
those evil persons pleased not god. But the euangell brings not a shadow
of eternal things, but the selue things which be eternal, as the holy
ghost, and ryghtwysenes, by which we be rightwyse before god. Wherefore they
only be the people according to the gospel, which receive this promise of the
spirit. Beside this, the church is the kingdom of Christ, distinct from the
kingdom of the devil. But certain it is that wicked men be in the power of
the dyuell, and members of his kingdom, as Paul teaches saying, Ephe. 2.
that the devil is mighty in infidelles. And Christ says to the pharisees
(which without doubt had an externe societe with the church, that is to
wit, with the holy persons that were in the people of the law, for they were
rulers, they sacrifised and taught) Ye be of your father the devil. So that
the church, which is the true kingdom of Christ, is proprely the
congregation of the godly. For the wicked be ruled of the devil, and be his
captives and prisoners, they be not ruled by the spirit of Christ. But what
need mo words in so manifest a thing? If the church, which is truly the
kingdom of Christ is distinct from the kingdom of the devil, it ensues
necessarily that wicked men, which be in the kyngedome of the devil, be not
the church, Although in this life because the kingdom of Christ is not yet
declared and opened, they be myxed with the true church, and bear offices in
the church / nor the wicked be not therefore of the ki^gdome of Christ, because
the revelation and openi^g of the matter is not yet made. For this is always the
kyngedome of Christ, which he by his spirit viuifieth, be it disclosed or
hid by the cross. Likewise as Christ is the self same, which is now
glorified, and which was before crucified and afflicte. And to this agree the
similitudes of Christ, which clearly says, that the good sede be y^ children
of the kingdom, A parable of Christ Mat. 15.
but the darnell be the children of the devil, the field he calls y^ world
not the church. In likewise John^ speaks of the hole nation of the Jews,
and says that the time shall come, y^ the true Church shall be severed from
that people. So that this place makethe rather against the adversaries than
with them, for it shows that the true and spiritual people be seuerable from
the carnal people. And Christ speaks of the image and lykenes of the
church, when he says: The kingdom of heaven is like to a net, or to.10.
virgyns. etc. And he teaches, that the Church is hid with the multitude of
evil men, lest y^ this sclau^dre or offendicle might offend good men / and
also to thenten^ that we should know y^ the words and sacraments be of
efficacitie and strength, although evil men have the handlynge of them. And
in the mean season he teachethe, that those wicked me^, although they have the
society of outward signs: yet they be not the very kingdom of Christ, and
the members of Christ, for they be members of the ki^gdome of the devil.
Neither do we dreme of a Platonical city (as certain men do wyckedly belie us)
but we do say, that this has a being and is in deed, even the true beleuers
and ryghtous men sparcled and scatered abroad throughout the hole world. And
we put unto, tokens and marks, the pure doctrine of the gospel, and due
administration of the sacraments. And this church is proprely the pyller of
truth, for it holds fast the true and pure gospel, and (as Paul says)
the foundation, which is the true knowledge and faith of Christ, albeit there
be even among these also many weyke persons, which upon the fundation do
build stubble or straw that shall perysshe, that is to say, certain
unprofitable opinions, which yet because they do not ouerturne and destroy
the fundation, be partly forgyuen them, and partly also be amended. But the
wrytynges of the holy fathers do witness, that otherwhiles they have also
builded stubble upon the fundation, but yet such have not overthrown their
faith. But the most part of these things, which our adversaries do defend,
do quite and clean overthrow the faith / as (for example) that they do
condemn the article of remission of sins. In which we do say, that by
faith is received remission of sins. It is a a manifest and a perylous
error also, that our adversaries do teach men to merit remission of sins
by love toward god, before grace. For this also is to take away the
fundation, (that is to wit) Christ. Also what shall we need faith, if the
sacraments justify by the virtue of the warke that is wrought, without the
good motion of mind? And likewise as the church has a promise, that it shall
always have the holy ghost: so has it co^minations and thretnynges, that there
shall be wicked teachers, and wolves. But that is proprely the church, which
has the holy ghooste, where as wolves and evil teachers, although they work
maistries in the church, yet they be not proprely the kyngedome of Christ, as
Lyra witnesses when he says: The diffinitio^ ol the church after Lyre.
The church stands not in men, by the reason of the power or dignity
ecclesiastical, or seculare. For many princes, and also bishops of Rome with
other infe^iors have been found to have run out of the faith. Wherefore the
church stands in those persons, in whom is the true knowledge and
confession of faith and truth. What other thing said we in our confession,
than that which Lyre says here? (...) diffinitio^ of the church after the
adversaries.
But paradue^ture our adversaries do require, that the Church should be this
wise defined, yt it is the highest outward monarchy of all the world, in
which the bishop of Rome ought to have absolute power to do what soever him
lusts with out rendryng acco^ptes to any man. Of which power no man ought to
dispute or judge* which has also power to make articles of the faith, to
abrogate what soever scriptures he list, to institute obseruau^ces and
sacrifices. Also to make what soever laws him lysteth, to dispense and loose
from what soever laws he list, whether they be gods laws or canonical
laws, or civil laws, of whom the emperor and all kings should receive power
and right to hold their kingdoms, by the commandment of Christ, to whom,
sithe the father has made all things subject: we ought to understand that
the same power and authority is deryued and translated in to the pope*
Wherefore it is necessary that the pope be lord of the hole world, of all the
kyngedomes of the world, of all things both publyke and private, and that he
have fulness of power in temporal and spiritual things, and that he have
both the swerdes, the spiritual and the temporal. And this diffinition not of
the church of Christ, but of the kingdom of the pope, has auctores for it,
not only canonistes, but also Daniell in the.xj. chaptre. That if we would
define the church after this facion, peradventure we should have more egall
and indifferent judges. For many things there be vnmeasurably and wyckedly
written concerning the power of the bishop of Rome, for which no man was ever
yet accused. we only be rebuked and punyshed because we preach the benefit of
Christ, y^ by faith in Christ we get remissyon of sins, and not by
ceremonies and services devised by the bishop of Rome. But Christ, the
prophets, and all the apostels, do far otherwise define the church of
Christ, than the kyngedome of the bishop of Rome. Neither is that to be
translated to bishops of Rome, which apperteineth to the true church, (that is
to wit) that they be pyllers of truth, that they do not err. For what one of
them does set his mind on the gospel, or does judge it to be worthy the
redynge?

Many men also do openly scorn all good lyuers and the true and sincere
religion of Christ, or if they do praise any thing, they praise those things,
which are agreinge to the reason of men. They think all other things to be
but lies and tales, and like to the tragedies of poets. Wherefore we according
to the scriptures do think, that the church taken in his proper
sygnifycation: is the congregation of holy men, which do truly believe the
gospel of Christ, and have the holy ghost. And yet nevertheless we grant that
there be many hypocrites and evil men mengled among them in this life, which
have a society and feloshype of outward signs and sacraments, and which be
members of the church, as touching the society of outward signs, and
therefore they bear offices in the Church. Neither does this thing take away
the effycacitie and virtue from the sacraments, because they be mynistred by
unworthy persons, sithe they do represente the person of Christ (by the
reason that the church has called them) and not there own persons, as
Christ witnesses. Who that hears you, hears me. For when they mynyster the
word of Christ, when they minister the sacraments of Christ: they minister
the^ in the stead and place of Christ. And this teaches us that saying of
Christ, lest we should be offended with the unworthiness of the mynisters. But
as concerning these matter, we have spoken plainly enough in our confession
where we do disalowe the Donatistes and the wiclevistes, which thought that
those men did syn, which received the sacraments of unworthy persons in the
church. These things at these time seemed to be sufficient to the defense of
the description of ye church, which we taught. Nether do we se, sith the
church in his proper signification is called the body of Christ, how it
should have been otherwise discrybed, then we have destribed it, for these is
undoubted, that wicked men do belong to the kingdom and the body of the
deuell, who drives them, and has them captives and thralles unto hi^. These
things be clerer, then the light at none day, which yet if our adversaries
will proceed to desprayse and calumniate, it shall not grieve us to make answer
more largely. Our adversaries do condemn also this perte of the seventh
article, Of the unity of ye church
where we said that it sufficed to the true unite of the church, to agree in
the doctrine of the gospel, and in the administratyon of the sacraments, and
that it is not necessary that in all places there be like humayne ^raditions,
rytes, and ceremonies instituted by men. A vain distinction
Here they make a distinction betwixt the universal and partycular rites, and
they do allow our article, if it be vnderstonded of the partyculer rites, but
if it be understood of the universal rites, they do not receive nor allow
it. In feythe we do not well perceive what our adversaries do mean. We speak
of the true, that is to say, of the spiritual unite, without which there can
be no faith in the heart, or ryghtuousnes of the heart in the sight of god. To
this unite we say that the lykenes and conformity of humayne rytes (whether
they be universal, or particular) is nothing necessary. For the justice of
faith is not a justice which is bound unto certain traditions, as the justice
of the law was bound to the ceremonies commanded by Moses, for the
ryghtuousnes of the heart, is a thing quyckenynge hearts. To this viuifycation
or quickenynge, man's traditions help nothing at all, whether they be
universal or particular. Neither be they effects and warkes of the holy
ghost, so as be chastyte, patience, the dread of god, the love of the
neighbor and the warkes of love. And they were no light causes which induced
us to put this article. For it is eu^^e^tly known that many folishe opinions
concerning tradityons be crept into the church. Some men have thought, that
humayne traditions be necessary honors and sacrifyces to deserve
iustifycatio^. And afterward they disputed, how it might be, that god could
be worshypped with so great variety? as who should say, that those
obseruaunces were divine honors, and not rather outward and polyticall
ordenaunces, nothing appertaynynge to the justice of the heart or to the
honourynge of god. Which do varye sometimes by chance, sometimes for
reasonable causes. Also diverse churches, have excomunicated one an other, for
such tradytions, as for the keeping of Easter, for images or pictures, and such
other like things. By the reason whereof, unlearned men have thought, that faith
or justice of the heart in the sight of god can not stand without these
obseruaunces, for there be concerning this busynes many folyshe wrytynges of
summistes and other, but in like wise as the unlike spaces of days and nights
do not hurt the unite of the church: A propre similitude.
so we do think that the true unite of the church is not hurt with unlike
rites instituted by me^, how be it, it lyketh us well that the universal rites
and obseruau^ces be kept for the mayntenau^ce of the common tranquillity, like
wise as we in our churches do with good will keep the order of the mass, the
Sunday and other high feasts. And with a very glade mind we observe and
keep the profitable and old ordenaunces, namely when they conteyne such
disciplyne and instruction, by which the people may be allured, and also
accustomed unto virtuous occupations. But we do not now dispute, whether it be
profitable for the come^ tranquillity, or corporal vtilite to observe and keep
the^. We have now another matter i^ hand, for we do dispute, whether the
obseruatio^s of human traditions be services necessary to justice i^ the
sight of god. This is the principal point to be judged in this controversy,
which ones determined, it may be judged afterward, whether it be necessary
to the true unite of the church, that there be like humayne traditions in all
places. For if human traditions be not honors or services necessary to
justice in the sight of god: it follows, that men may be ryghtuouse and the
sons of god, although they have not some traditions which be received in
other places. As if the form and fascio^ of the Douche apparaile be not an
honoring of god necessary to justice in the sight of god: it follows, that
there may be ryghtuous men and the children of god, and the church of Christ,
although some men do not use the Douche manner of apparel, but the Frenshe
fashyon of apparel. This does Paul plainly teach to the Colossians* when
he says, let no man judge you in meat and drink, Collos. 2
or in part of the holyday, or of the new moan or of the sabbot days. Which
be but shadows of things to come but the body is Christ also, if ye be dead
with Christ from the elements of the world, why, Collos. 2
as if ye ^ ere lynynge to the world, do ye make decrees? Touch not, taste
not, handle not. Which things every one do peryshe being consumed by use* and
they be precepts and doctrines of men, having the semblance of wisdom, in
superstition and humilite. For this is the mind of Paul, In as much as the
ryghtousnes of the heart is a spiritual thing, quickenynge hearts* and that it
is certain that humane traditions do not quicken the hearts neither be the
effects and works of the holy ghost, as is love of the neighbor, chastity.
etc^. nor be any instruments by which god does move and stir hearts to
believe, as by the word and the sacraments given by god, but be exercises of
things nothing perteining to the heart, and which do peryshe by use: it is
not to be thought, that they be necessary to justice in the sight of god. And
accordyngly to the same sentence he says. Romans 14
The kingdom of god is neither meat, nor drink, but ryghtuousnes, and peace,
and joy in the holy ghost. But it is no need to allege many testimonies,
forasmuch as the scripture runs full of them. And we also have gathered a
great sort together i^ our confession, in the latter articles. And the
principal point of this co^trouersy shall be rehearsed again a little herafter
(that is to wit) whether traditions of men be honors or services necessary to
ryghtuousnes in the sight of god, where we shall dispute more largely of this
matter. Our adversaries do say, that universal tradicions be therefore to be
kept, because they be thought to have been taught by the apostelles. Oh
religious and devout men. They will that the rites and ceremonies taken of the
apostelles, be keep and maynteined, but they will not that the doctrine of the
apostles be reserved and kept. It is so to be judged of those rytes, as the
apostles the^ selves do judge in their wrytynges. For the apostelles would not
that we should think ourselves justified by such rites, or that such rites
and ceremonies, be necessary to justice in the syghht of god. The apostles
would not lay any such burden upon consciences. They would not put
ryghtuousnes and sin to stand in the observations of days, of meats, and
of such like things. Yes Paul calls such manner opinions doctrines of
deuylles. Therefore the will and purpose of the apostles ought to be sought out
of their wrytynges. It is not enough to allege an example. They observed and
kept certain days, not because ye same observation was necessary to
justification but that the people should know, what time they ought to come
together. They observed also certain other rites and ceremonies, as the order
of the lessons, at what time they came together. The people also observed
certain of their forefathers vsages and customs, which the apostles did
sumwhat change, and apply to the history of the gospel, as Easter /
wytsontyde / to the intent y^ not only by teaching but also by these examples
they might deliver and leave the remembrance of these most great things, to
them that should come after. Now if these things were taught as necessary to
justification: why have the bishops afterward changed many even of the
same things? That if they were of gods law: it was not lauful to change
them by man's auctorite. Easter, diverse men kept at diverse times before the
council of Nicene. Nether did this diversity and unlikeness hurt the faith.
Afterward a way was taken, that our Easter should not fall upon the same
time, that the Jews kept their Pasche or Easter. But the apostelles commanded
the churches to keep Easter with their brethren, which were converted of
Jews. Wherefore this manner and custom certain nations did supersticiously
keep and hold long after the counsel of Nicene in observing and following
the time of the Jews. But the entente of the apostels was not with that decree
to bind the churches to any necessite. which thing the words of the decree
d^ witness. For they bid that no man should care, although his brethren
keeping Easter do not reken and account the time aryght. The words of the
decree be in Epiphanius wryte^ in the greek tongue, which we have translated in
to english in this wise. Make ye no supputation, but when your brethren,
which be of the circumcision make their Easter, make ye Easter with them, and
if they err in their supputation, do not ye care. These words Epiphanius
writes to be the words of the apostels, put in a certain decree concerning
Easter. In which a trise reder may easily judge that the intent of the
apostels was to pluck from the people the folyshe opinion of the necessite of
a certain and set time, in asmoche as they do forbid them to care, although
some do mysse in the right accomptynge.

Moreover certain men in the east parties called Audians (which were so
called of the author of their opinion) because of this decre of the apostels
did contend, The sect of the Audians.
that Easter was to be kept with the Jews. Epiphanius co^futynge them
commends the decree, and says, that it conteyneth nothing dissonau^nte or
disagreinge from the faith, or from the ecclesiastical rule, and he
disprayseth the Audianes, because they do not understand the words a right,
and he expouneth it according to the same sense that we do interpret it (that
is to say) not that the apostels did mean that it did greatly force, what
time Easter were kept, but because the chief brethern were converted of the
Jews, which kept their own custom: they would that the resydue should
follow thexample of them, because of concord and unity to be had. And the
apostels did wisely admonyshe the reder, yt they neither took away the
Evangelical liberty, neither yet did bind consciences to any necessity. For
they do add, that it is not to be regarded, although there be a defalte made
in right rekenyng of the time.

Many like things may be gathered of histories, in which it apperethe, that
the variety and vnlykenes of humayne obseruaunces do not hurt the unity of
the faith. How be it what needs any disputation? Our adversaries do nothing
at all understand, what the justice of faith is, what the kyngedome of
Christ is, if they judge, that a lykenes is necessary euerywhere of
obseruatio^s in meats, days, apparel, and semblable things, which have not
the commandments of god. How the adversaries them selves do break
universal obseruau^ces.
But I pray you, se the religious and holy men our adversaries. They require to
the unite of the church like human obseruau^ces in all places, and yet they
them selfs have changed the institution and ordenaunce of Christ in the use
of the souper of the lord, which with out doubt before was an universal
ordenaunce. That if universal ordinances be necessary, why do they change
the ordenau^ce of Christ's souper? which is none ordinance of man, but the
ordenau^ce of god. But of this hole controversy we must speak at certain
times herafter.

THe eight article they do approve hole, in which we confess, The.8. article
of the ministers of ye churche^
that hypocrites and evil men be mengled together in the church. And that the
sacraments be of strength and efficacitie, although evil men have the
handlynge of them, because the ministers do here represent the person of
Christ, and not their own person, according to that saying of Christ: Who
soever hereth you, hereth me. Wicked teachers be to be forsaken, for they do
not now use the place or stead of Christ, but they be Antichrists. And
Christ says: Beware of false prophets. And Paul writes, If any man shall
preach any other gospel than this, which I have preached to you, accursed be
he. Yet never the less Christ has monyshed and taught us in collations of
the church, that we being offended with the private vices either of the
priests, or of the people should not raise up schisms, like wise as the
Donatistes did full vngratiously. But those persons, The Anabaptists would
have al in comune.
which did therefore raise up schisms, because they said it was not lawful for
priests to hold possessions, or to have any thing in propre or several to
them selves we do judge utterly to be sedicious persons. For to hold a thing
as propre, is a civil ordination. And it is laufull for christen men to use
civil ordenau^ces, as well as to use this air, this light, meat, or drink.
For as this nature of things, and these certain motions of the sterres be the
ordenau^ce of god, and be maynteined by god: even so the laufull civil
ordenaunces be the very ordenaunce of god, and be preserved and defended by god
against the devil.

THe.ix. article they do allow, in which we confess, The.9. article, of the
baptizyng of infau^te^.
that baptism is necessary to salvation, and that children be to be baptized,
and that the baptism of children is not in vain, but necessary and
effectual to salvation. And because the gospel is purely and diligently
taught among us, by the benefit of god, this fruit also we do take of it, yt
in our churches there have been none Anabaptists, because the people have been
armed with the word of god, against the wicked and sedicious faction of those
robbers and thieves. And albeit we do condemn and disalowe very many other
errors of the Anabaptists: The Anabaptists.
yet this we condemn in especial, that they dispute the baptism of children
to be unprofitable. For it is undoubted, that the promise of health and
salvation apperteyneth also to little children. But it does not apperteyn to
them, which be out of the church of Christ, where is neither the word,
neither the sacraments. For the kingdom of Christ has the being only with
the word and the sacraments. Therefore it is necessary to baptize infau^tes,
that the promise of salvation may be applied to them, according to the
commandment of Christ. Baptize ye all people. Where like wise as to all me^
is offered salvation: so to all men is offered baptism, both to men, women,
children, and infantes. It follows therefore evidently, that infau^tes must be
baptized, because health is offered with baptism.

The ij. reason.
Secundarely it is manifest, that god does approve the baptism of infantes.
Therefore the opinion of the Anabaptists is wicked, which disalowe the
baptisyng of infantes. And that god does allow the baptisynge of infantes, it
is declared sufficiently by this, ye god does give the holy ghost to them,
that be so baptized. For if this baptism were void, than the holy ghost
should be given to none at all, than should none be saved, and finally there
should be no church at all. Even this reason alone is able to confirm and
establyshe sufficiently good and godly minds against the wicked and mad
opinions of the Anabaptists.

THe.x. article they do approve, in which we do confess and knowledge, The.10.
article of the sacrament of ye Altar.
that we do think, that in the souper of the lord, or sacrament of the
aultare, there is verily and substantially the body and also blood of Christ,
and that they be verelye exhibited and given with those things, which be
seen, that is to say, breadde and wine, to them which do receive the
sacrament. This sentence and opinion our preachers have steadfastly defended,
and we find, that not only the Romayne church does affirm the bodily
presence of Christ, but also the Greek church that now is, and also in old
time has been of the same opinion, as the canon of the mass witnesses which
the Greeks do use. And there be records also of certain writers testifienge
the same. For Cyrille upon John^ in the.xv. chapitre, Cyrillu^
says, that Christ is corporallye exhibited unto us in the souper of the
lord. For thus he says: Yet we do not deny, that by right faith and sincere
charity ^e be joined to Christ spiritually. But that we have no manner of
conjunction with him, as touching the flesh, that verily we do utterly deny.
And we do say, that it is clean contrary to the scriptures of god. For who
has doubted that Christ also has been the vine, and we the branches, which
do get life forth of it to our selves? Harken what Paul says. For all we
be one body in Christ. For all be it we be many: yet be we all on in him For all
we be partetakers of one bread. Does he think happyly that the virtue of the
mystical benediction is unknown to us? which sithe it is made in us, does
it not also by the partetakyng^ of the flesh of Christ make Christ to dwell
corporally in us? And not long after he says. wherefore it is to be
considered, that Christ is in us not only habituallye, which is perceived by
charity, but also by natural perticipation* etc. These things we have
recited, not to thentent to begin a disputation here of this matter (for
themperours majesty does not disalowe this article) but to thentent* that who
so ever shall read these things may perceive the more clerelye, that we do
defend the sentence received in the hole church, that in the souper of the
lord be truly and substa^cially present the body and blood of Christ, and be
verily exhibited and given with those things which be seen, breadde and wine.
And we do speak of the presence of the living Christ, For we know that death
shall no more have power over him.

The.xj. article of absolutio^
THe.xj. article of receiuynge absolution in the church, they do allow. But as
concerning confession, they add a correction, that is to wit, that the
constitution is to be observed of the chapitre, Omnis utrius^ sexus. etc. that
both confession should be made yearly, and though all the sins can not be
rekened up by nombre, yet that diligence is to be given to gather them all to
mind, and those which may be brought to remembrance* to be showed and
rehearsed. Of this hole article we shall speak hereafter more plentuouslye,
when we shall declare our hole sentence touching penance. This is evidently
known, that we have so set forth, declared, and garnyshed with praises the
benefit of absolutio^, and the power and auctorite of the keys, that many
afflicted and troubled consciences by the doctrine of our preachers have taken
comfort, after that they have herd say, that it was the commandment of god,
yea moreover the very voice of the gospel, that we should believe, and trust to
the absolution, and steadfastly decree with our selves, that remission of sins
is freely given to us for Christ's sake, and that we should think, that by
this faith we be verily reconciled to god. This sentence has lift up and
conforted many godly minds, and in the beginning brought unto Martine Luthere,
very great commendation among all good men, when he showed sure and strong
consolation to consciences: because before that time, the hole power and
strength of consolation was oppressed with the doctrines of warkes, when
Sophistres, and freers did teach nothing at all of faith and of remission of
sins. But as concerning the time, doubtless in our churches very many men do
often times in the year use these ^wo sacraments* absolution, and the souper
of the lord. And they that teach of the dignite and the fruits of the
sacraments, do speak in such sort, that they do exhort and provoke the
people to use the sacraments often times. For there be many things so written
by our men concerning this thing, that our adversaries (if any be good men
among them) do undoubtedly approve and commend them. There is also denounced
excommunication to wicked persons and despisers of the sacraments.
Excommunication.
These things thus be done, both according to the gospel and to the old
canones. ^ut no certain time is prescribed, be cause all men be not a like mere
at one time, yea if all men should come to gether at one time, men can not be
herd in order and instructed. And the old canones and fathers do not appoynte
any certain time. Only the canon says thus: The words of the Canon.
If any do enter in to the church of god and be perceived never to take their
housyl let them be admonyshed. And if they do not then take their housyl, let
them come to penance. If they do take their housyll, let them not always
absteyne. If they do not, let them absteyne. Christ says: That they do eat
condempnation to them selfs, who soever do eat unworthily. Therefore the
persons and curates do not compel those persons which be unmeet to use the
sacraments.

OF the nombryng of sins in confession, The rehersall of sins in confession.
men be in such wise taught, that consciences be not snarled and entangled,
although it is profitable to use and accustom unlearned persons to rehearse
certain sins, yt they may ye more easily be taught. But we dsspute now what
is necessary by gods law. Our adversaries therefore ought not to have
alleged the constitution to us. Omnis utriusque sexus. etc. Which
constitution we know well enough, but they should have proved by the law of
god, that nombrynge or reckoning up of sins is necessary to obtain
remission. The hole Church throughout all Europa knowethe, what manner grynnes
and snares that particle of the co^stitution has cast upon consciences, which
byddeth to confess all our sins. Neither is there so much hurt in the
text it self, as afterward the Summistes have feigned to it, which do
gather the circu^staunces of sins. What endeles mases be there? What a
torme^trie of good minds has been there? For as for them that were wild and
ungodly, such manner fearynges did nothing move at all. Afterward what manner
tragedies and troubles has the question, De proprio sac^rdote, The question.
De proprio sacerdote.
that is to say, of a propre or peculiar preeste raised among curates and
freers? which when they did war about the kingdom of Confessions, were
nothing less, than fr^tres which they were called.

We therefore do think yt the rehearsal or nombrynge up of sins, is not
necessary by the law of god. And this is the mind of Panormitanus,
Panormitanus.
and of the most part of the other learned in the law. Neither will we lay a
necessite upon the consciences of other men by that constitution Omnis
utriusque sexus. etc. Of which we do judge likewise, as we do of other human
traditions. Of which we have this opinion, that they be not honors or
services necessary to justification. And this constitution commands a thing
impossible, where as it byddeth us confess all our sins. For it is certain
that very many of them we do neither remember, nor perceive according to that
saying of the psalm, Delicta quis intelligit? who perceyueth sins or
trespasses? If they be good pastors, they shall know how far forth it is
profitable to examine unlearned people. But we will not confirm and establyshe
that tormentry of Summistes, which yet should have been least intolerable, if
they had added one word of faith, confortynge and lyftynge up consciences.
Now of this faith obteynynge remission of sins, there is not one syllable
in so great an heap of co^stitutions, of gloses, of sums, of
confessionalles. Christ is never read in none of them all. Only there is
read accomptynges and nombrynges of sins. And the most part is spente in
sins committed against the traditions of men, which is most vain. This
doctrine has driven many godly minds to desperation, which could not be
quiet and in rest, because they thought that the just rehersall of sins
was necessary by gods law, and yet they found by experience that it was
impossible. But there remain in the doctrine of our adversaries touching
penance, other as great defaltes, which we shall forthewith rehearse.

Of penance or repentance.
IN the.xij. article they approve the first part, in which we declare, that
they which have fallen into sin after baptime, may obtain remission of
sins, at what time soever and how often soever they be converted. The second
par^t they conde^pne, in which we say, that the parts of penance be
contrition and faith. They deny, that faith is the one part of penance. What
may we here do. Oh most victorious emperor? This is the propre voice of the
gospel, that by faith we obtain remission of sins. This voy^e of the
gospel those writers of the confutation do conde^pne. We can therefore in no
wise agree to the confutation. We can not co^dempne the most wholesome saying of
the gospel so full of comfort. What other thing is it to deny, that by
faith we do obtain remission of sins: then to do injury to the blood and
death of Christ? We beseech you therefore (O charles most victorious Emperor)
that ye will patiently, and diligently hear us, and know this most wayghty
matter, which conteyneth the principal place of the gospel, the true
knowledge of Christ, and the very honor of god. For all men shall find that
we in this matter specially have taught true things, godly things, wholesome
things, and necessary things to the hole church of Christ. They shall find
that by the writing of our men, much light has come to the gospel, and
that many perilous errors be amended, with ^he which the doctrine of
repentance was here tofore suppressed by ye opinions of schole doctors and
Canonistes. And before we come to the defense of our sentence and opinion, this
must we needs speak before. All good men of all orders, even also of the
theological order do confess and grant that before the wrytinges of Martine
Luther, the doctrine of repentance was very confuse. There be books of
sente^tiaries, wherein be infinite questions, which no divines could ever
sufficiently declare. The people could neither co^prise the su^me of the
matter, neither yet see what things were principally required in penance,
neither wherein peace of conscience was to be sought. Let one of our adversaries
come forth, which can tell us when remission of si^nes is done or wrought. The
errors of scholeme^
Good lord what great darkness is among the^? They doubt whether in
attrition orels in co^trition, remission of sins be had. And if it be had for
contrition, what needs absolution? What does the power of the keys, if sin
be already forgiven? And here also they do sweat and labor much more, and do
wickedly extenuate and minishe the power of the keys. Other some there be
which say that by the power of the keys sin is not forgeuen: but only
eternal pains be changed into temperall pains. So were the most holsom
power and auctorite, a ministration not of life and of spirit: but only of
wrath and punyshementes. Some of them again, which be sumwhat more wylye, do
feign and ymagyne, that by the power of the keys sins be forgeuen in the
sight of the church, but not in the sight of god. This also is a perilous and
mischeuous error. For if the power of the keys does not comfort us in the
sight of god: What thing then (I pray you) shall make a quiet conscience? Now
these things ye follow be also more perplex, doubteful and intricate. They
teach, that we do merit grace by contrition. Where if a man ask why Saul,
Judas and other like do not obtain grace and pardone with most bitter and
horrible remorse, The ^^ffere^ce betwixt the co^trition of Judas and the
co^trition of Peter.
which were co^trite. Here they ought to make their answer by faith and by
the gospel, because Judas did not believe, because he did not lift up, and
comfort him self with the gospel, and the promise of Christ. For faith
shows the diuer site between the contrititio^ of Judas, and the contrition of
Peter. But our adversaries make their answer by the law, that Judas loved not
god, but feared punyshementes. but when shall a troubled and frayed conscience,
(namely in these earnest, true, and great terrors, which be described i^ the
Psalms, and the prophets, and which those men do undoubtedly taste, which
be truly converted) when shall (I say) such a troubled conscience, be able to
judge whether he fears and dreadeth god truly and for him self, or whether
he does but flee everlasting pains? These great motions, and trobelouse may
be happily discerned or disseuered by letres and vocabules, but they can not be
depted so in su^dre i^ very deed as these sweet sophisters do dream. Here we
call upon the judgments of all good and wise men. They undoubtedly will
confess and grant that these disputations among our adversaries be very
dark, doubtful, perplexe and intricate. And yet here they be in hand with a
most wayghty matter and with the chief and principal place of all the
gospel, I mean, concerning forgyuenes of sins. All this hole doctrine
concerning these questions which I have rehearsed: among our adversaries is
full of errors and hypocrisy, and defaceth obscureth and endymmeth the
benefyte of Christ, the power of the keys, and the justice of faith. These
things be done in the first act or part of the play. But what when they be
come unto confession? What infinite and great business is there in that endless
rehersall, numbryng and reckenyng up of sins? Which nevertheless for a great
part is spent and consumed in man's traditions and laws. And because that the
good and devout minds might be the more vexed: they feign and ymagen that
this rehersall and just reckeni^g of the sins is commanded by gods law.
And though they do exact and require this rehersall of all the sins under
the pretense of the law of god: yet in the mean season of absolution which
is in deed of the law of god they speak full slenderly and full coldly. They
feign that the self sacrament, Ex opere operato, that is to say, even of the
very work that is wrought gives and conferreth grace without any good mocion
of the vser. But of faith who receives the absolution and comforts the
conscience: is made no mencio not all. This is even according to the proverb.
Ante mysteria discedere. that is to say, to depart before the mysteries are
begone. Now rests and remains the third act or part of the play which
is of satisfactio^s. And these act has very confuse disputacions. They feign
that everlasting pains be changed into the pains of purgatory and that
part of these, be relesed by the power of the keys and part they teach to
be redeemed with satisfactions. They add moreover that satisfactions must be
works of supererogation, and them they set and put in most folyshe
obseruaunces, which have not the commandment of god to bear them, as in
pylgrymages, rosaries, and like obseruatio^s, which be maynteyned by no
commandment of god. Furthermore likewise as^ they redeem Purgatory with
satisfactions: so has there ben a craft devised of redemynge satisfactions,
which has been a very gayngfull and profitable craft and has brought in
much lucre. For they sell pardones, which they do interpret to be
releaseme^tes of satisfactio^s. And this gaynes comes in not only by them
that be alive: but much more largely by them, which be dead. And not only
by pardons, but also by the sacrifice of the mass they redeem the
satisfactions of dead men. Finally the matier of satisfactions is endeles.
Among these sclaunders and offendicles of conscience (for we be not able to
rehearse all) and doctrines of deuyls: the doctrine of the justice of faith in
Christ* and of the benefit of Christ lies oppressed and overwhelmed.
Wherefore all good men do perceive that the doctrine of Sophistes and Canonistes
touching repentance or penance is by us profitably and godly rebuked. For
these articles and points following be openly false, and not only disagreyng
and mere repugnant to the holy scriptures, but also dissonau^t and variable
from the holy fathers of the church. These be their articles.

We therefore to the intent to deliver godly and well disposed consciences from
these comberous and endless mases of sophesters, do make two parts of penance,
that is to wit contrition and faith. If any man lusts to add the third,
I mean worthy fruits of penance (yt is to say) good works following
conversion: we will not say against him. And we know well enough, that this
word (penitentia in latin, that is to say, repentance) among Gra^marious
does betoke^ to mislyke and disalowe that thing which before we did like and
allow. This propertye is more agreinge to contricion, rather then to faith.
But we in this place to thentent to express and set forth the thing before
men's eyes, do understand by penance the hole conversion in which there be two
terms, mortification and vivification, which we call by the usual and
accustomed names, contrition and faith. As concerning contrition we do cut
away those idle, vnfrutful, and endless disputations as to dispute, when we be
sorry through love of god and when through fear of pain? But we say that
co^trition is the true fears and terrors of conscience which perceives and
feleth that god is angry with syn and soroweth that it has sinned and done
amysse. And this contrition is done when by the word of god sins be rebuked.
For this is the su^me and effect of preaching the gospel: to rebuke sins and
to offer remission of si^nes and justice for Christ's sake and also to offer
the holy ghost and eternal life, and that we being regenerate and bo^ne a new
should work well and do good deeds. Thus Christ comprehends the su^me of
the gospel when he says. Luke the taste.
To be preached in my name repentance and remission of sins among all
nations. And of these terrors and dreades speaks the scripture, as in the
psalm. Because my sins and wyckednes have gone over my heed, Psalm. 37
like a great heavy burden they have lain heavy upon me. etc. I have been
afflicted and humbled very soore. I did rose for sorrow and syghyng of my
heart. And in an other psalm he says. Lord have mercy on me, for I am weyke.
Psalm. 6.
Heal me (lord) for my bones be troubled, and my soul is troubled very sore.
And thou (o lord) how long? And Esaye says: Esa. 38.
In the half of my days I said I shall go to the gates of hell. I hoped
until morning. Even like a lion so has he broused and broken al my bones. In
these terrors the conscience felethe the wrath of god against sin, which
is unknown to careless and recheles persons, which walk after a fleshely
fashyon. This conscience seethe the fylthynes of sin, and is earnestlye sorry
that it has done amysse. It also fleethe in the mean season the horrible
wrath of god because man's nature is not able to sustain it, onles it be
stre^gthed and borne up with the word of god. So says Paul. By the law I am
dead to the law. For the law only accuses and makes afraid co^scie^ces.
In these terrors our adversaries do speak nothing at all of faith. Thus
only they propowne and sex forth the word, which rebukes sins. The which
word, when it is taught only, is the doctrine of the law, and not of the
gospel. with these sorrows and terrors they say that men do merit grace: if
it be so that they love god. But how shall men love god in the true fears and
terrors: when they feel the horrible wrath of god, which can not be
expressed with the words of man? What other thing do they but teach
desperation, which in these troublous terrors do only show the law?

We therefore do add that other part of penance, The.ij. part of penance or
repentance.
which is faith in Christ, to the end that in these terrors the gospel of
Christ might be set forth to consciences, in which is freelye promised
remission of sins for Christ's sake. They ought therefore to believe, that for
Christ's sake their sins be freelye for given them. This faith lyf^ethe
up, conforteth, strengtheth, and quickens contrite persons, according to
that text. Iustificati igitur ex fide pacem habemus erga deum. Roma. 5.
That is to say, we being justified by faith have peace. This faith
obteyneth remission of sins, it justifies in the syghte of god, as the same
place testifies, The virtue of faith.
when it says, we being justified by faith. etc. This faith shows the
diversity betwyxte the contrition of Judas* and the contrition of Peter,
betwyxt the contrition of Saul, and the contrition of David. The contrition of
Judas or Saul does not therefore avail, because faith is not added unto it,
which receives forgyuenes of sins, freely given for Christ's sake.
Contrarily the co^trition of David or of Peter does therefore avail, because
faith is added, which receives remission, freely given for Christ is sake.
Neither is their any love, before that we be made at one by faith. For the
law is not fulfilled without Christ, according to this. By Christ we have
passage to god. And this faith grows and increases by little and little, and
wrastleth throughout the hole life with sin, to the end it may overcome sin
and death. But love folowethe faith, as we have said before. And thus may
filial or sonly fear be plainly defined, to be such manner fear, Filial
fear*
which is joined with faith, that is to say, when faith comforts and
holds up the troubled and fearful heart. Servile or bondly fear is, when
faith does not bear up the fearful heart.

How the power of the keys does administer and show forth the Gospel by
absolution, Servile fear.
which is the true voice of the gospel. So we also do comprehend
absolution, when we do speak of faith. For faith comes by hearing, as Paul
says. For when the gospel is herd, when the absolution is herd, the
conscience is lyfted up, and gathers conforte. And because god does truly
quicken by the word: the keys do verily remitte sins in the syghte of god,
according to that text, who soever hears you, hears me. Wherefore credence
is to be given to the words of him that assoileth, none otherwise tha^ to a
voice sou^dynge from heaven. And absolution may proprely be called the sacrament
of penance, as the best learned also of the schole divines do speak. In the
mean season this faith in temptations is many manner ways nouryshed, by the
sentences of the gospel, and by the use of the sacraments. For these be
signs of the new testament (that is to say) signs and tokens of the
remission of sins. They do offer therefore remission of sins, as the words
of the souper of the lord do euidentely witness, which be these. This is my
body, which is given for you. Mat 26 1 Cor. 11.
This is the cup of the new testament. etc. So faith is conceived and
establyshed by absolution, by hearing of the gospel, by use of the sacraments:
to the^tent that it do not take a fall, whiles it wresteleth with the terrors
of sin and death. This instruction and doctrine of penance is plain and
clear, and augmenteth the dignity of the power of the keys, and of the
sacraments, and sets forth the benefit of Christ, and teaches us to use
Christ a mediator and a propitiator. But because the confutation does
co^depne us for that we have put these two parts of penance: it is to be
showed, that the scripture does put these principal parties in repentance,
or in the conversion of a sinner. For Christ says: Mat. xi.
Come unto me all ye which labor and be laden: and I shall refresshe you.
Here be two members. Labor, and burden (which is the first membre or part)
do signify contrition, and the dredes and terrors of sin. To come to
Christ (which is the second membre) is to believe, that for Christ's sake
sins be forgyuen, for when we believe, our hertes be quickened with the holy
ghooste by the word of Christ. Therefore here be two principal parts (that
is to say) contrition, and faith. And in the first chaptre of Mark Christ
says: Do ye repentance and believe the gospel. A general faith and a special
faith
where in the first part he rebukethe sins, and in the latter part he
does conforte us, and shows remission of sins. For to believe the gospel
is not that general faith, which deuyls also have: but it is proprely to
believe that remission of sins is frelye given for Christ's sake. For this is
disclosed and showed in the gospel. Ye see here also two pertes to be joined
together, I mean co^trition, when sins be re^uked. And faith when it is
said, Believe ye the gospel. If any any man will say, that Christ does
comprise here also the fruits of repentance, or the hole change of life, we
will not disagree to him. For this is sufficient to us, that these principal
parts be named, contrition and faith. Paul commonly every where, when he
describethe the conversion or renouation, makethe these two parts,
mortification, and vivification, as in the second chapitre to the
Collossianes. Col. 2.
In whom ye be circuncised with circuncision not done with hand that is to
wit, by layeng of or putting away the body of the sins of the flesh. And
afterward, In whom ye be also resuscitate by faith of the efficacy and
might of god. Here be two parts. The one is ca^^i^g of or puttyng away the
body of sins. The other is resuscitation by faith. And these words,
mortification, vivification, castyng of or putting away the body of sins,
and resuscitation ought not to be understand Platonically of a feigned
mutation: but mortification signifiethe true terrors, such as be of men which
be dyenge. which terrors nature could not sustain, if it were not holden up
and conforted by faith. So like wise castyngof the body of sins, he calls
that, which we commonly call co^trition. For in those sorrows natural
concupiscence is purged and rydde out. And vivification ought, to be
understood, not a Platonicall imagination, but the consolation which truly
mayntaineth life, fleing away in co^trition. There be therefore here two pertes
contrition and faith. For sithe it is so, that the conscience can not be set
at peace and rest but by faith: therefore faith only does quicken, according to
that saying. A ryghtuous man shall live by faith. Abac. 2.
And afterward to the Collossianes he says, Collos. 2
that Christ does blot out the chirograte or obligation, which by the law is
against us. Here also be two pertes the obligation and the cancellynge and
blottynge out the obligation. The obligation is the conscience rebukyng and
condempnyng us. The law is the word, which rebukes and condempneth sins.
This voice therefore which says: I have sinned to the lord (so as David
said) is an obligation. In the.2 ^oke of the kings
And this voice or saying, ungodly and careless men do never bring forth
ernestly. For they do not se, nor read the sentence of the law written in their
heart. In the true dolours and terrors this sentence is seen. The obligation
therefore is co^trition it self, condempnyng us. To cancel and blotte out the
obligation, is to take away the sentence of condempnation out of the mind:
and to grave in it the sure sentence, by which we do think that we be
delivered from that conde^pnation. But faith is that new sentence, which
abrogateth and dissanulleth the former sentence, and gives peace and life to
the heart. Authorities forth of scripture.
How be it what need we to cite many testimonies and auctorities, sith the
scripture rennethe so full of them. An the.11^. psalm David says: The lord
has soore chastysed me, and has not delivered me to death. And in the.118.
psalm he says. My soul has faynted for anguyshe. Stre^gthen me with thy
word. where in the first membre is contained contrition. And in the second,
the manner is plainly described how we be refreshed and conforted in contrition
(that is to wit) with the word of god, which offers grace. This word
holds up and quickens hertes. Also in the first book of the kings. Dominus
mortificat and uiuificat, 1. Reg. 2.
deducit ad i^feros and reducit That is to say, the lord mortifieth and
quickens, he brings down to hell, and bryngethe up again. By the one
of these is signified co^trition, and by the other is signified faith. Esa. 2^.
And Esaye also says. Dominus irascetur ut faei^t opus suum. Alienum est opus
eius ut operatur opus suum. The lord shall be angrye, to thentent he may do his
own work. The work of him is the work of an other man, that he may work
his own work. He calls it an other man's work or a strange work, and not
his, when he does make afraid. For the propre work of god is to quicken and
to conforte. But he does therefore make afraid, that there might be place for
consolation and vivification. For careless hertes, and which feel not the
wrath of god, regard not consolation. After this sort the scripture is wo^te
to join these two things together, I mean, fear and comfort, that it might
teach us, that these be the principal members in repentance, co^trition I
say, and faith, which conforteth and iustifiethe. Neither see we how the
nature of repentance can be more purelye taught. For these be the two
principal works of god in men: to make afraid, and to justify and quicken
the afraid consciences. In to these two works ye hole scripture is
distributed and divided. The one part is the law, which shows, reproves,
and co^dempneth sins. The other part is the gospel, that is to say, the
promise of grace freely given in Christ. And this promise is often times
repeted in the hole scripture, which was first given to Adam, afterward to
the patriarchs, and after set forth by the prophets, and last of all it was
preached and fulfilled by Christ among the Jews, and by the apostles spredde
and diuulgate in to the hole world. For by the faith of this promise all holy
men have been justified, not for their own attritions or contritions. And
examples do show likewise these two parts. Examples. Adam.
Adam is chydden after his sin, and made thoroughly afraid. This was
contrition. Afterward god promysethe grace, he says, Gene. 3.
that there shall seed come, by which should be destroyed the kingdom of the
devil, death, and sin. There he offerethe remission of sin. These be ye
chief points. For all be it afterward there is added punyshement: yet this
punyshement does not merit remission of sins. And of these kinds of
punyshementes we shall speak not long hereafter. 2. Reg.
So David is chydden of Nathan the prophet, and being thoroughly troubled and
made afraid, he says, I have sinned against the lord. This is the
co^trition. Afterward he hears absolution, wha^ the prophet says unto
him. The lord has taken away thy sin* thou shalt not dye. This voice
conforteth David, and bears him up by faith, it justifies and quickens
him. Here is also added a punyshement. But this punyshement does not deserve
remission of sins. Neither be there always added peculiar peines, but these
two co^trition and feythe must needs be always in repentance, as in the.7.
chapitre of Luke. A certain woman that was a sinner came unto Christ weeping. By
these tears is known contrition. Afterward she hears absolution. Thy
sins be forgyuen the thy faith has made the saufe. Go thy way in peace.

This is the other part of penance, faith, which lyfteth up and conforteth
her. Of all these things it apperethe plainly to godly reders, that we do put
those pertes of penance, which be proprely in the conversion, or regeneration
and remission of sin. worthy fruits, and punyshementes do follow regeneration
and remission of sin. And therefore we have put these two parts: to thentent
that faith might be the better seen, which we require in repentance. And it
may be the better perceived, what the faith is, which the Gospel preaches,
when it is set against contrition and mortification.

And to thentente that all the world may see how great is the ignorance of
true piety and godlynes in our controllers and judges, which wrote the
confutation, we will add, also the sentence of saint Barnarde, who even in
likewise knytteth together in repentance these two me^bres, co^trition and
faith as we do. These be his words in the third sermon of the Annu^ciatio^.
Audita^ fa^ mihi mane mi^ am tuam, S. Barnarde.
quid in te sperdui dn^e. Sola nimiru^ spes apud te miserationis locum obtinet,
nec olcum mi^ae, nisi in uase fidu^iae ponis. Sed ost infidelis fiducia, solius
utique maledictionis capax, cum uidelicet in spe peceamus. Quan^ nec fiducia
illa dicenda si^, sed insensibilitas quaedam and dissimula^io perniciosa. Quae
enim fiducia est ei qua^ periculu^ non attendit^ au^ quod ibi timoris remedium,
ubi nec timor sentitur, nec materia ipsa timori^ ^ fiducia solacium est, nec
eget ille solatio, qui laetatur cum male fecerit, and in pessimis rebus magis
exultat. Rogemus itaque (fratres) responderi nobis qua^tas habeamus iniquitates
and peccata, scelera nostra and delicta^ nobis desideremus ostendi. Scrutemur
uias nostras and studia nostra, periculaque uniuersa uigili inte^tione pen
semus. Dicat quisque in pauore suo, uadam ad portas in feri, ut iam no^ nisi in
sola dei mi^a respiremes. Haec uer^^ hominis fiducia est a se deficientes and
innite^tis domino suo. Haec inquam uer a fiducia est, cui misericordia non
denegatur, propheta testante. Beneplacitu^ est domino super timentes eum, and
in his qui sperant super misericordia eius. Nec parua utiq, suppetit nobis, in
nobis quidem causa timoris, in ipso autem causa fiduciae.1. Lord let me hear
thy mercy early in the morning, because I have trusted in the. Undoubtedly only
hope obteyneth place of mercy with the. Neither doste thou put the oil of
mercy but in the vessel of hope. But that is an unfaithful hope and a vessel
apt and mete to receive malediction: when we do sin in hope. Howebeit that
ought not to be called any hope or trust at all, but rather a certain
insensibilitie, and a perelous dissimulation. For what trust has he which
regards not the ieoperdye? Or what remedy of fear is there, where neither
fear is felt, neither the matter it self and cause of fear? Trust is a
comfort but he needs no comfort which is merry when he has done amiss, and
rejoices in his ungracious factes. Let us therefore (o brethren) pray that
answer may be made unto us, how great iniquities and sins we have. Let us
desire to have our sins and trespasses showed unto us. Let us search and
ransake our ways / and all our studies and all our ieoperdies let us consider
and ponder with diligent intention. Let every man say in his fear and dread,
I shall go to the gates of hell, to the end we may now rest and comfort
our selves in the only mercy of god. This is the true trust of man shrynkyng
away from him self and leanyng to his lord. This (I say) is the true trust,
to which mercy is not denied, wytnessyng the Prophet in the psalm. The
lord has been well plesed with the^ that fear him and in them which trust
upon his mercy. And there is verily in us no little cause of fear and in him
no little cause of trust. Thus far speaks Bernarde, whose sentence and
mind we were therefore the more wyllyng to report that the readers might see
and perceive how we in these place do take faith to be mea^t of the hope of
mercy which lyfteth up and comfort affrayed minds, which faith Bernarde
calls right well fiduciam that is to say trust. And this may be evidently
seen, when there is made an antithesis or contention of terrors and of
comfortes. Likewise as Barnarde here will that there be in men an acknowlegyng
of sins or contrition or terrors. And will also that there be added trust
which may lift up and comfort us in contrition. But because our adversaries
do here principally and expressly condemn us where we say that men by
faith obtain remission of sins: we will add a certain few probations by
which it may be understood that forgyuenes of sins do chance not by the
work wrought for co^trition, but by that especial faith, by which every
person believes that he is forgyuen and pardoned of his sins for Christ's
sake. For this is the principal article about which we do strive with our
adversaries, and the knowledge whereof we think to be most necessary to all
Christen men. But forasmoche as we seem to have spoken enough of the same
thing before in the title of justification: therefore here we will be the
shorter. For they be places very much like and as who would say, nere cosyns,
the doctrine of repentance, and the doctrine of iustificacion. Our adversaries
when they speak of faith and say that it goes before repentance, they mean
faith not this which iustifyeth* but that which in a generality believes
that god is, and that there be pains ordained for wicked men. etc^. But we
over and besides that faith do require, that every man should believe his sins
to be forgyuen him for Christ's sake. About this special faith we strive and
do set it against the opinion which byddeth to trust not in the promise of
Christ, but in the work wrought of contrition, of confession and of
satisfactions. etc^. This faith does so follow and ensue the terrors, that
it does over come them, and sets the conscience at quietness and rest. This
faith delyuereth us from terrors and does create and engendre peace, joy, and
a new life in the heart. This faith we do defend to be truly necessary to
the remission of sins. Therefore we put it among the parts of repentance or
of conversion. Neither does the church of Christ think any otherwise
although our adversaries do say the contrary. The.i. reason.
And first of all we do ask our adversaries whether to receive absolution be
a part of penance or repentance or else no? Now if they do separate it from
confession (as they be very subtle in distinctio^s) we can not se, what
confession avails without absolutio^. But if they do not separate the
receiving of absolution from confession: they must needs think, that faith
is a part of penance. For absolution is not received: but by faith. And that
absolution is not received but by faith, it may be proved by Paul, which
teaches that the promise can not be received but by faith. Romans 4.
How absolution is the promise of the remission of sins. Therefore it does
necessarily require faith. And we do not se, how he can be said to receive
absolution, which does not assente and agree to it. And what other thing is
it, not to agree to the absolution: then to accuse god of a lie? If the barte
does doubt, it thinks, yt those things be uncertain and vain which god
does promise. Therefore it is written in the epistle of Johan whosoever
believes not god makes him a liar because he does not believe in the
testimonye which god has witnessed of his son. 1. Io. 5.


The.^j. reason.
Secondaryly we suppose, that our adversaries do grant that remission of sins
is either part, or the end, or terminus ad que^ (as they use to speak) of
penance or repentance, ergo that thing, whereby remission of sins is
received, is of right added to the parts of penance. But most certain it is
and most undoubted although all the gates of hell would cry against it, that
remission of sins can not be received but only by faith, which believes that
sins be forgyuen for Christ's sake, according to that saying of Paul to the
Romans, whom god has set forth a propitiator, by faith in the blood of
him. Also in the fyfthe to the Romans. By whom we have way through faith
into grace. etc. For the troubled and arraryed co^icence can not plede nor lay
against the wrath of god their own works, or love, but so is only the
conscience made quiet, when it receives the mediator Christ, and believes
the promises given for his sake, for they do not perceive, what remission of
sins is, or how it comes to us: which dream, that hearts be set at peace
without faith in Christ. Peter alleges out of Esaye this saying. whosoever
shall believe in him shall not be confounded or ashamed* Wherefore hypocrites
must neues be confounded which trust that they receive remission of sins
for their own works and not for Christ's sake. And Peter says in the acts.
To him all the prophets bear witness that al which believe in him do receive
remission of sins through his name. Act. 10.
It could not be spoken more manifestly than y^ he says (through his name)
And he adds (all that believe in him). We do only therefore thus receive
remission of sins, through the name of Christ, that is to wete, for Christ's
sake* and not for any merits or works of our own And this is so done when we
believe that sins be forgyuen us for Christ's sake. A digression.
Our adversaries cry out that they be the church and that they do follow the
consent of the church. But Peter here in this our cause alleges also the
consent of the church. To him (says he) all the prophets bear wytnes that by
his name they receive remission. etc^. Undoubtedly the consent of the
prophets is to be judged the consent of the universal church. We do neither
grant to the bishop of Rome neither yet unto the church power or authority to
decre against this consent of the prophets. But the Bulle of Leo bishop of
Rome do openly condemn this article of remission of sins our adversaries do
also co^dempne it in their confutation. By which thing it appears what manner
church their church is to be judged, which not only with decrees disalowe
this sentence, that remission of sins is purchased by faith, not for our
works, but for Christ, but also command to destroy that sentence and opinion
with violence and with the sword. They command also with all kind of
cruelty to destroy the good men, which be of the same opinion and mind. But
they will say, that they have great and famous authors for them, as master
Duns, Gabriel* and other like, the sayenges also of fathers* which be recited
in the decrees, but maimed and imperfect, Certes if we should fall to
numbering of testimonies they have the better band. For there is a great
rablement of tryfelyng writers upon the master of the Sentencies, which do
even as it were conspire to gether in defendyng these figmentes and lies of the
merit of attricion and of works, and the things which we have here to fore
recyted. But let no man be moved with the multitude of them. For thauctoritie
is not great of the late writers, which were not the fathers of their own
wrytynges, but only embesylyng and robbyng the old fathers, did shyfre and
turmoyle opinions forth of one book in to an other. They used no manner
judgment, but only (after the fashyon of the Senators, which were called
Pedarij) without any words allowed the errors of them that had written before,
Pedarij be those which i^ a pliament assemble, or counsel do speak nothing
them selves but run from their own place to here other when they speak and
allow their words which they little understand.
whom they perceived not. We therefore will not be afraid to set this saying
of Peter, who allegeth the consent of the prophets against the legions of
sententiaries, be they never so many. And to this preaching of Peter is added
ye testimony of the holy ghost. For thus says the text. Adhuc loquente Petro
uerba haec, cecidit spiritus sanctus sup omnes, qui audiebant uerbum.1. And as
Peter was yet speaking these words, the holy ghost lyghted upon al them,
which did hear the word. Let all good and godly consciences therefore know
that this is the commandment of god, that they should believe their sins to
be freelye forgyuen them for Christ's sake, and not for our own works. And
with this commandment of god let them strengthen and sustain them selves
against desperation, and against the terrors of sin and of death. And let
them know that this sentence and opinion has always remained in the church
among holy and good men, sithe the beginning of the world. For Peter does
clearly allege the consent of the prophets. And the writings of thapostles
testify yt they were of the same mind. we have also testimonies of the
fathers. For Barnarde says the saw in plain and open words. Necesse est enim
primo omnium credere, quod remissionem peccatoru^ habere no^ possis nisi per
indulge^tiam dei, sed add adhuc ut credas and hoc, quod per ipsum peccata tibi
donantur. Hoc est testimonium quod perhibet spiritus sanctus in cord tuo
dicens, dimissa sunt tibi peccata tua. Sic enim arbitratur apostolus gratis
iustificari hominem per fidem.i. For it is necessary first of all to believe
that thou canste not have forgyuenes of sins, but by the indulgence of god:
but add yet hereunto, so that thou doste believe this also, that by him thy
sins be forgyuen the. This is the testimony, which the holy ghost hears in
thy heart, saying, Thy sins be released the. For thus judges thapostle that
man is freely justified by faith. These words of Barnarde do wonderfullye
illustrate and set forth our cause, for he not only requires in a
generality, that we should believe our sins to be pardoned through mercy,
but byddethe us also put to a special faith, by which we may believe, that
even unto our own selves sins be pardoned. And he teaches how we may be
assured of remission of sins, that is to say, when by faith hertes be
lifted up, and be made quiet and set at rest by the holy ghost. What do our
adversaries require more? Dare they yet deny, that we obtain remission of
sins through faith? Or that faith is a part of penance?

The.iij. reason.
Thyrdly. Our adversaries say, that sin is in this wise forgyuen, because he
that is attrite or contrite does bring forth an act of the love of god, and
that by this act he meriteth to receive remission of sins. This is nothing
else but to teach the law, and to destroy and abrogate the gospel, and to
disanull the promise concerning Christ. For they do only require the law and
our works, for the law requires love. Besides this, they do teach us to
trust that we obtain remission of sins, because of contrition and love.
What other thing is this, than to set our trust and confidence upon our
own works, and not upon the word and promise made by god of Christ? Now if
the law be sufficient to the obteynyng of remission of sins, to what purpose
need we the Gospel? what need have we of Christ, if for our works we obtain
forgyuenes of sins? But we contrarywyse do call again consciences from the
law unto the gospel, and from the trust in their own works, to trust and
to have sure confidence in the promise, and in Christ, because the gospel
sets forth Christ unto us, and promyseth remission of sins freely for
Christ's sake. By this promise the gospel byddeth us trust, that for Christ's
sake we be reconciled to the father, and brought in to his favor again: and
not for our own contrition, or for our own love. For there is none other
mediator or pacifier than Christ. Neither can we work the law, oneles we be
first reconciled by Christ. And though we could do any thing: yet we ought
to think that not for these works we obtain remission of sins, but for
Christ's sake, which is the mediator and mercy stock. Yea it is injury and
dishonor to Christ, and a defeatyng of the gospel, to think that we do
obtain remission of sins for the law, or by any other ways, than through
faith in Christ. And this reason we have handeled before in the title of
justification, when we told wherefore we do hold opinion that men be justified
by faith, and not by love. Therefore the doctrine of our adversaries, where as
they teach, that men for contrition and love obtain forgyuenes of sins, and
bydde them trust in this contrition and love, is only a doctrine of the law,
and that not understood. Likewise as the Jews did look upon the covered face
of Moses, For admit that we had love, let us imagyne that we had works: yet
can neither love, neither works be a price, ransom, or propitiation for
sin. Neither can they be set and pleded, as it were in bar, against the
wrath and judgment of god, according to that saying of David in the psalm:
Thou shalt not enter in to judgment with thy servant: for no creature living
shall be justified in thy syghte. Neither ought the honor of Christ to be
plucte from him, and given to our works. For these causes Paul does styffly
affirm, that we be not justified by the law, and he sets against the law,
the promise of remission of sins, which is given for Christ's sake, and
reaches us, that we freelye for Christis sake through faith receive remission
of sins. To this promise Paul does call us back from the law, Upon this
promise be byddeth us steadfastly to behold, which doutles shall be void and of
no strength, if we be justified before by the law, or ever we be justified by
the promise, or if we obtain remission of sins for our own justice. But the
case is clear, that therefore the promise was made unto us, and therefore Christ
was given to us, Note well wherefore Christ serves.
because we can not work and fulfill the law. wherefore it is necessary, that
we be first reconciled by the promise, or ever we do work the law. But the
promise is only received by faith, Ergo it is necessary, that contrite
persons do by faith receive the promise of remission of sins, which is
given for Christis sake, and that they do decree with them selfs, that they
have the father reconciled unto them selfs freely for Christis sake. This is
the sentence and mind of Paul in the epistle to the Romans* where he says:
Therefore by faith, that according to grace or favor, To. iiij.
the promise might be ferme and stable. And to the Galathianes he says: Gal.
iij.
The scripture has concluded al things under sin, that the promise by the
faith of Jesus Christ might be given to them that believe, that is to say, All
men be under sin, and can not otherwise be delivered, onles by faith they do
take and receive the promise of remission of sins. First therefore we must by
faith receive remission of sins before or we do work the law, al be it (as
it was above said) love follows faith, because they that be regenerate do
receive the holy ghost, and therefore they begin to work the law. We would
recite mo testimonies and authorities, if it were not so, that they be open and
at hand to every devout and godly reader in the scriptures. For we covet not
to be ouerlo^ge and tedious, to thentente that this cause or matter may the more
easelye be perceived. Neither is it any doubt, but that this is the sentence
of Paul, which we do defend, that by faith we receive remission of sins
for Christis sake, and that by faith we ought to set Christ the mediator
against the wrath of god, and not our works. And let not the minds of good
men be troubled, although our adversaries do calumniate and corrupt the
sentences of Paul. There is nothing spoken so purely and truly, but it may
be depraved by captious cauillations. We assuredly know, that this, which we
have recited, is the very right and true sentence and meaning of Paul. we
know this our sentence does bring ferme and stable comfort to godly
consciences, without which no man is able to stand in the judgment of god.
Wherefore let these pharisaical opinions of our adversaries be rejected and
thrust out of men's ^ertes, that we do not by faith receive remission of sins:
but that we must merit remission with our love, and with our works, and that
we ought to set our love, and our works against the wrath of god^ This is the
doctrine of the law, and not of the gospel, which does feign and imagine
that man is first justified by the law, before that he be reconciled by
Christ to god, notwithstanding that Christ him self says, Without me ^e can
do nothing. Also, I am the true vine, and ye be the branches. But our
adversaries do imagine, that we be the branches not of Christ, but of Moses.
For they will first be justified by the law, and offer their love and works
unto god, before that they be reconciled to god by Christ, before that they be
braunces of Christ. Paul contrarywyse says plainly, that the law can not be
wroughte nor fulfilled without Christ. Therefore the promise is first to be
received, that by faith we may be reconciled to god, for Christis sake, or
that we work the law. These things we do judge to be clear and evident
enough to godly consciences. And hereof they shall plainly perceive the cause
why we did heretofore hold opinion and profess, that men be justified by
faith, and not by love. For we must plede against the wrath of god not our
love or our works, nor trust in our love and works, but Christ the mediator
and we must first receive the promise of remission of sins, or ever we
work the law.

The.iiij. reas^n.
Finally. When shall the conscience be set at rest, if we do receive remission
of sins, because we love, or work the law? For the law will always accuse
us, because we never satisfy the law of god, according to the saying of
saint Paul, Lex iram operatur. The law works wrath. Chrysostom asks
the question concerning penance, whereby we be assured that our sins be
forgyuen us, our adversaries also in the sentences do ask the question
concerning the same thing. This can not be declared, neither consciences can
not be made quiet, onles they know that it is the commandment of god, and
the very gospel, that they should be assured, that for Christ's sake sins be
freely forgyuen, and that they should not doubt, but that they be freely
forgyuen unto them selfs. 1. Io. 4.
If any manne does doubt, he (as John^ says) accuses the divine promise of a
lie. This certeyntie and assurance of faith we teach is required in the
gospel. But our adversaries leave men's consciences uncertain, and in a
doubtfulnes. Now consciences do work nothing by faith when they do
continually doubt, whether they have remission. How can they in this
doubtfulnes call upon god? How can they persuade them selves, and be assured
that they be herd? Thus all their life is without god, and without the very
true honor and worshyppynge of god. This is it that Paul says, that what
soever is not done of faith is sin. To. 14.
And because they continue always in this doubtfulnes, they never have
experience what faith is. So it comes to pass at the last, that they fall
in to desperation. Such is the doctrine of our adversaries, even a very
doctrine of the law, a dissanullyng, and an a^rogation of the gospel, and a
doctrine of desperation. Now we do gladly permit unto all good men to give
judgment of this place concerning penance (for it is plain enough, without
any manner of obscurity) and to pronounce which of us have taught the more
godly and more wholesome doctrine for consciences, whether we, or our
adversaries. Certes these dissensio^s in the church do nothing delight us,
wherefore if we had not great and necessary causes to dissent from our
adversaries: we would with right good will hold our peace. Now since it is
so, that they condemn the manifest and open verity: it stands not with our
profession, neither is it laufull for us to leave this cause undefended, which
is not ours, but Christ's cause, and the cause of the church. We have showed
for what causes we have put these two parts of penance, contrition, and
faith. And we have done it so much the rather, because there be borne about
many sayenges concerning penance, which be alleged of the fathers, but
maimed and imperfect, which our adversaries have detorted and wrested to the
defacynge of faith. As for example, Penance is to sorrow and bewail the
offenses committed, and not to commit again, Saienges of fathers concerning
penance
which thou oughteste to bewail and sorrow. Also penance is a certain
punyshement or vengeance of the sorower, aue^gyng in him self the offense,
which he is sorye that he has committed. In these sayenges is no mention of
faith, no not so much as in the schools, when they do interpret and declare
them: is any thing at all added of faith. Wherefore we, to thentent that the
doctrine of faith might be the better espied, have nombred faith among the
parts of penance. For those sayenges, which do require co^trition or good
works, and which make no mention of faith that iustifiethe: the very thing
it self shewethe, that they be very perylous. And doubtless it may be thought
(and that not without cause) that those men lacked a point of prudence and
wisdom, which have heaped together these peced and patched rableme^tes of
sentences and decrees. For where as the fathers in diverse other places do
speak of the other part of Penance: it should have been profitable to have
pyked out the sentences of both parts* and to have joined them together, and
not only out of one part. Tertulliane.
For Tertulliane speakethe ercellently of faith, amplifienge the oath of the
lord, which is in the prophet* Viuo ego dicit dominus, I live is the oath
whereby god swereth.
nolo mortem peccatoris, sed ut conuertatur et uiuat.i. I live, says the
lord, I will not the death of a sinner, but that he be converted and live.
For in as much as the lord does swear, there he will not the death of a
sinner, he shewethe and declares, that credence and faith is required, by
which we should believe his oath, and surely reken with our selves that he does
forgive us. The promyses of god ought to be of great authority with us,
although they be made without any oath put unto them at all. But this promise
is also co^fermed and bound with an oath. Wherefore if any man does not surely
reken with him self that he is forgyue^: he denies that god has sworn a
true oath. which is so great a blasphemy, that there can none be imagined
more heinous. For thus says Tertulliane: The words of Tertulliane.
He calls us to salvation with a reward, swearyng also: in that he says, I
live, and couetethe that we give credece unto him. O blessed be they, for whose
cause god s^^eareth. O most wretched be we, if we believe not the lord when he
also swears. And here it is to be known, that this faith ought to think,
that god freely forgyueth us for Christis sake, because of his own promise,
and not because of our works, or contrition, confession, satisfaction or love.
For if faith should lean unto these works, and be grounded upon them: anon
it is made uncertain and doubtful. For the fearful conscience does se, that
these works be unworthy. Therefore says Ambrose very well in his work of
Penance, these words following. Ambrose
Therefore it is convenient, that we believe, both that penance is to be done:
and that forgyuenes shall be given, but yet so, that we do hope forgyuenes, as
through faith. For faith obteyneth as it were by an especialtie or
obligation. Also faith it is, which does cover our sins. So than there be
sentences in the works of the fathers, not only of contrition and works, but
also of faith. But our adversaries, because they neither perceive the nature
of penance, neither the sayenges of the fathers, do pyke out the sayenges
concerning the one part of penance, that is to wit, works. But those things
which be spoken in other places of faith, because they do not understand
them, they pass them over.

Of confession and satisfaction.
GOod men may easily judge, that it is very profitable and necessary, that the
true doctrine be kept concerning the parts a^ouenamed, that is to wete
concerning contrition and faith. Therefore in setting forth of these places
we have always most busied our selves, and as for confession and satisfaction,
we have not greatly co^tended nor striuen For we also do retain and keep still
confession, and specially because of absolution which is the word of god /
because the power of the keys by the authority of god does pronounce and
give sentence of every thing. Wherefore it should be a wicked deed to take away
private absolucion out of the church. Neither do they perceive and understand
what is remission of si^nes, or what is the power of the keys: who soever they
be that do despise and take away private absolution. But concerning the
rehersall and reckenyng up of sins particularly by name in confession: we
have said before, that we do not think it necessary by the law of god. An
objection.
For where as certain me^ do obiecte, that a Judge ought first to know the
matter before that he do give sentence: this objection is nothing to this
purpose. The solution.
For absolutio^ is but the execution of the benefit given by an other, and not
a judgment. For Christ gave charge and commandment to forgive sins. This
commandment the ministers do e^ecute. They have no commandment of knowi^g
the sins, that be secret. This thing may well be perceived hereof, because
they forgive innumerable sins, which they them selves do never remember, to
whom they be forgyuen. And if remission should hang upon the knowledge of
sins: then all the matter should be uncertain and doutful. But in those sins
which be openly known what manner jurisdiction the church has: that
belongs not to these present disputation. For these, because they be open and
known, they be accused by name / and afterward be forgyuen by name, if the
doer of them will be received again of the church. And it is a folyshnes to
apply unto this matter the saying of Solomon, which is this. Diligenter
cognosce vultum pecoris tui.i. Know diligently the face of thy catayle. Solomon
For Salomo^ speaks no whit of confession, but he gives a moral lesson and
instruction to an householder, that he should use that which is his own, and
forbear from that which is an other man's / and he bids him to look
diligently unto his own things, but yet in such wise, that his mind being
occupied and set all upon the desire of gatheryng goods, he do not cast away,
the fear of god, or faith, or the love of the word of god. But our
adversaries do merueilously transform and chau^g the words of scripture, into
what soever sentences or meanynges it lyketh them selves / here unto the^, this
word (know) betokens to here confessions. The face betokens not the
outewarde conversation, but the secrets and priuities of conscience. And
catayle signifies men. Forsothe a goodly and a propre interpretation, and
semely for such despysers of the studies of eloquence. But if any man list by
a similitude to translate this instruccion from the householde keeper, and to
apply it unto a pastor or curate of the church, then doubtless, he ought by the
face to understand the outward co^uersatio^. This shall be a more apt and a
more agreeable similitude. But let us pass over these things / some times
there is mention made of confession in the psalms / as Dixi co^fite^ or
aduersum me iniustitiam meam domino et tu remisisti iniquitatem peccati mei.i.
I said I will confess and knowledge against my self my wickedness unto the
lord, and thou haste forgiven the wickedness of my syn. Such manner confession
of syn which is made unto god is the very right contrition. For when
confession is made unto god, it must needs be done with the heart, and not
only with the mouth, so as is done of the players in enterludes. Such manner
confession therefore is contrition, in which we felyng and perceiuyng the
wrath of god, do confess that god is wroth not with out just cause, and
that he can not be pacified with our works. And yet nevertheless we seek mercy
of god, for his promise sake. Such manner confession is this confession of the
prophet. Tibi soli peccaui. etc. To the alone have I sinned, that thou may
be justified and may ouercom when thou shall judge, that is to say I
knoweledge my self to be a sinner, and to have deserved everlasting wrath,
neither can I set my ryghtuousnes nor my merits against thy wrath. Therefore I
pronounce the to be rightuous, when thou doste condemn and punyshe us / I
pronounce that thou haste the victory, when hypochrites do judge the that thou
art unrighteous, because thou doste punyshe or condemn the^ well deseruyng it
/ yea more over our merits can not be set against thy iu^gement, but in
such wise we shall be justified, if thou doste justify us, if thou do repute
us justified through thy mercy. Perauenture su^me man will allege Iamys who
says, Jacob. 5.
confess your sins one of you to another. But he speaks not here of
confession to be made to the priests: but in a generality of the reconciling
of brethren among them selves / for he bids confession to be made of each
to other. Furthermore our adversaries shall conde^pne many of the most
approved auctours, if they will contend that the rehersall of sins in
confession is necessary by gods law. For although we do approve confession
and do judge that a certain examination is profitable to the intent that men
may be the better instructed and taught: yet nevertheless the thing is in such
wise to be moderated and measured, that consciences be not tangled and snarled
/ which undoubtedly shall never be quiet, if they should think, that they
can not obtain remission of sins, onles they make that scripulous and just
rehearsal of sins. That saying doubtless is very false, which our adversaries
have put in the co^futation, that an hole and perfect confession is necessary
to salvation. For such confession is impossible. And I pray you what snares
cast they here upon the conscience, when they require a hole and perfect
confession? In the books of doctors of the church, mention is made of
confession, but they do not speak of this reckoning up of secret sins: The
old custom of the church.
but of the ceremonies and manner of open penance. For because that sinners,
and persons of evil fame were not received again in to the church without
certain satisfaction: therefore such manner persons made confession unto the
priests, to thentent that according to the quantity of their offenses,
satisfactions might be enjoined unto them. All this matter is no point like to
this reckoning up of sins, whereof we now speak. That confession than was
made, not because that without it, there could be no remission of sins before
god, but because satisfactions could not be enjoined onles the kind of the
sin were first known, For according to the diversity of sins, sundry
canons and constitutions were made. And of that usage and manner of open
penance, we have now only the name left of satisfaction. For the holy
fathers would not receive again sinners and evil famed persons, onles they
had first known and proved the repentance of them, so much as might be. And
of this thing there appears to have been many causes. For it was a good
ensample to cause other to beware, to chastise and correct them that had
offended (as the gloss teachethe in the decrees) and it was an unseemly thing
and not convenient to receive notorious sinners forthwith to the communion.
These manners and customs have been laid down many years ago. Neither is it
requisite to set them up again, for they be not necessary to remission of
sins before god, Neither was this the mind and opinion of the fathers, that
men should merit remission of sins by such vsages, or such works. How be
it those sightes and spectacles of open penite^tes be rum onte to begyle the
unlearned and vnskylled men, in that that they thrughe this occasion think that
by those works they merit remission of sins before god. But if any man has
so thought, he had a Judicial and an hethen thought. For hethen men also had
certain purgatio^s and satisfactions of sins, by which they imagyned them
selves to be reconciled to god. But now the custom and usage being said
down and put away, the name of satisfaction does remain, and a certain
step and token of the custom, which is, that in confession be enjoined
certain satisfactions, which they call and define to be works not of duty.
we call them canonical satisfactions. And of this our opinion is (likewise,
That canonical satisfactions be not necessary by gods law.
as it was of the rehersall of sins) that canonical satisfactio^s be not
necessary by the law of god to the remission of sins, no more tha^ these
old spectacles and shows of satisfactions in open penance were necessary by
the law of god to the remission of sins. For that sentence concerning faith
must be retained and kept, that by faith we obtain remission of sins for
Christis sake, and not for any works of ours, either going before or
following. And for this cause principally have we disputed of satisfactions,
lest they should be received to the defacynge and obscurynge of the justice of
faith, and lest men should think, that for those works they obtain remission
of sins. And this error is encresed by many sayenges which be comenly used
in schools, as (for example) when in the definition of satisfaction they put
this particle and clause, that it is done to pacifye the wrath and displeasure
of god. But yet our adversaries grant, The doctrine of scholeme^
that satisfactions do not avail or help to the remission of the sin or
offense / but they ymagine that satisfactions be auaylable to redeem the pains
either of Purgatory, or else other. For thus they teach, that in the remission
of syn god forgyueth the offense. And yet because it is convenient to the
justice of god, to punyshe syn, he chau^geth the pain eternal into pain
temporal and transitory. They add moreover, that part of that temporal
pain is released by the power of the keys, and the residue is redeemed by
satisfactio^s. And it can not be perceived, what pains they be of which part
is released by the power of the keys: onles they do say that part of the
pains of Purgatory be released / of which thing it should ensue that
satisfactions be only pains redemyng Purgatory, and these satisfactio^s (they
say) to be of strength also, though they be done of them which be fallen
again into deadly sin: as who should say that the wrath and displeasure of
god might be appeased by them which be in deadly syn. All this is but a feigned
matter lately imagined without auctorite of scripture, and of the old doctors
of the church / and not so much as Peter Lombard does speak after this manner
of satisfactio^s. The schole men saw that there were satisfactions in the
church: but they perceived not that these open shows and spectacles of
penitentes were instituted partly for cause of example, and partly to prove
and try them, which desired to be received of the church. Brefely, they did
not perceive that it was a discipline, and a matier utterly and mere
political. And therefore they superstitiously imagined those satisfactions not
to be auaylable to discipline in the syghte of the church, but to be of power
and strength to appease the divine wrath. And likewise as in other things
they have often times mengled together spiritual matiers, and politic or
civil matiers: even so the same has happened also in satisfactions. But the
gloose in the canon laws does other whiles witness, yt these obseruances and
ceremonies were i^stituted for cause of discipline and good order to be had in
the church. And see I pray you, after what manner in the co^futation, which
they have presumptuously offered unto the emperors majesty, they prove these
their feigned imagitio^s. They allege many sayenges of the scriptures to begyle
them, which be unlearned, as though this thing had his authority by the
scriptures: which in the time of Peter Lumbarde was as yet unknown. The
reasons of the adversaries.
They allege these sentences, Work ye the worthy fruits of penance. Also
Give your members to serve ryghtwysenes. Also Christ preaches penance,
saying: Do ye penance. Also Christ byddethe his apostles to preach
penance. And Peter preaches penance in the second chapitre of the acts.
After this they allege certain sayenges of fathers, and canones. And they
conclude with these words, Satisfactions in the church be not to be put away,
contrary to the express words of the gospel, and to the decrees of councels,
and of the fathers: but rather they that be assoyled of the priest ought to
perform and fulfill their penance enjoined, following that saying of Paul, He
gave him self for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and that he might
cleanse to him self an acceptable people, the ensuer and fol^w^r of good works.

How I ^^^eche god to destroy these wicked sophisters, which so mischeuously
do detorte and wrest ye word of god unto their most vain dreams. What good
man would not be grieved to se this their so shameful demeanor? Christ says,
do ye penance, and the apostles preach penance, ergo, Everlasting pains be
redeemed with our satisfactions? Ergo the keys have authority and a warrant to
release part of the pains of Purgatory? Ergo satisfactions do redeem the
pains of Purgatory? Who taught these asses this manner logyke? But this is
neither logyke nor sophistry, but it is plain falsehed, decepte, and a
sycophantical art. For to this purpose they allege this saying (do ye
penance) that when unlearned men do hear such a sentence alleged against us,
they should conceive an evil opinion in us, that we should take away
repen^au^ce all together. By these sleyghtes and crafts they go about to
turn the minds of men from us, and to kendle hatred against us, to this only
purpose, that the unlearned men should cry against us, that such myscheuous
heretics as we be should be ryd out of the world, which do improve and
disalowe penance. But we certainly hope, that among good men these false
accusatio^s shall little prevail, And god will not long suf^re so great a
^oldnes and malice. Neither does the ^yshoppe of Rome profitably provide for
his own dignity, in that he does use such manner defenders, and that he
does suffer these sophisters to give judgment of so great a matter. For where
as we in our confession have comprised ^elnere the sum of the hole christen
doctrine: there ought such men to have been made judges for to have given
sentence of these so great, so many, and so diverse matiers, whose doctrine and
faythfulnes had been known and approved of good men. And this thing it
became the, Ca^pege. Cardinal
o Cardynall Ca^pege, according to thy wisdom, to have provided, that these
sophisters should not write any thing in these so great and wayghty matiers,
which either no^e in this time, A digresision.
or else in time to come, might seem to be an occasion to mynyshe the auctorite
and reputation of the sea of Rome. If the sea of Rome does judge it right, that
all nations should know her for mastres and teacher of faith, she ought to
give diligence, that learned, virtuous, and discrete men should have the
determination and handli^g of matters touching the christen religion. For what
shall the world judge, if at any time the writing of our adversaries shall be
brought forth in to light? what shall they that shall come hereafter, judge
of these false and erroneous judgments? Thou see Campege that these be the
last days, in which Christ prophesied before, that much ieoperdie should
happen to his religion. Ye therefore, which ought to sit on high, and to
govern the christen religion, it was semynge for you now in these days to
use both singular wisdom, and also diligence. There be many signs, which,
(if ye look not well about you) do threten a change to the Roman estate.
And thou art far deceived, if thou thynkest ye co^gregations are to be holden
and kept still only by violence and force of arms. Men desire to be taught
and instructed of their religion. How many think thou be there, not only in
Germany, but also in England, in Spain, in Italye, in France, yea even in
the city of Rome also, which, because they perceive and se controversies to
be risen even of the very greateste matters, do begin to doubt in some
things, and in their minds be angrye, because ye refuse in due form to know
and to judge these so wayghtie matters, and because ye do not deliver and set
at large, combred and doubtefull consciences, and because ye only commau^de,
us to be oppressed and destroyed with violence and force of arms. And there be
many good men, whom it would grieve less to suffer death, and all kinds of
tourmentes, than as they do to suffer this ambiguitie and doubtfulnes. Neither
do thou sufficiently consydre and way, how great a thing the christian
religion is: if thou thynkeste that good men be but little payned, at what time
they begin to doubt of any opinion or article. And this doubtefulnes can not
but engendre merueylous bitter hatredde against them, which, where as they
ought to find help and remedy for consciences, do let that the matter can
not be opened and plainly declared. We speak not here how greatly ye ought
to fear the punyshement of god. For the bishops of Rome regard this thing
but lightly, which sith they them selfs bear the kayes, may (be ye sure) when
they list, open heaven unto them selves. We do speak of the judgments of
men, and of the close and secret hertes of all nations, which doubtless at
this time do require yt these matters might be in such wise known, ordered,
and determined that good minds might be healed, and delivered from
doubtefulnes. For what shall come of it, if it fortune ones that these hatredes
conceived in men's hertes against you do brast out, thou may by thy wisdom
easily judge. But with this benefit ye may bind all nations unto you (which
all wise men do judge to be an high and a very great benefit) if ye will
heal the doubtefull and waueryng consciences. We have not spoken these things
to this purpose, that we do doubt of our confession. For we know certainly,
that it is true, godly, and profitable to good consciences. But it is a thing
lykely, that there be every where many men, which doubt of no small matters,
and yet do not here any mete teachers, which may heal their consciences.

But let us return again to our purpose, The scriptures alleged of our
adversaries do speak nothing at all of canonical satisfactions, and of the
opinions of schole men: for asmoche as it is evidently known, that these
things have spronge up and begone but of late time. wherefore it is nothing
else but pure falsehed and lyenge, that they do wreste and apply scriptures
unto those their opinions. We say that after penance, that is to say, after
conversion or regeneration, there ought to follow good fruits and good works
in all our life. Neither can it be any true conversion or true contrition,
where mortifications of the flesh and good fruits do not follow. The true
fears and true dolours of the mind do not suffer the body to give it self
to pleasures / and true faith is not unkind to god, neither does it despise
the commandments of god. Finally there is none inward repentance, oneles
it does engendre and bring forth also outwardly chastisementes and
punyshementes of the flesh. And this we say to be the mind of John^
Baptiste, when he says: Mat. 3.
Eacite fructus dignos penitentiae. Do ye the worthy fruits of repentance.
And also of Paul when he says, Give your members to do service unto
ryghtuousnes. Like wise as he says in another place, Give your bodies, a
quick and an holy sacrifice. etc. And when Christ says, Argume^te^ proving
that the scriptures before alleged apperteyne not to the satisfactions of
scholeme^. The first ^eason.
Do ye penance: doubtless he speaks of hole penance, of hole newnes of life,
and of fruits, He speakethe not of those hypocritical satisfactions, which
schole men do imagine even than also to be auayllable to the redemynge of the
pains of Purgatory, or of other pains, when they be done of them, which be
in deadely sin.

And many arguments may be gathered, that these sayenges in scripture do in no
manerwise appertain to the scholasticall satisfactions. These scholemen do
feign that satisfactions be works not due. Now the scripture in these te^tes
does require works which be due. For this saying of Christ, Do ye penance,
is a saying of commandment. The.ij. reason.
Also our adversaries do write, that he which makes his confession, if he do
refuse to receive the satisfactions, comenly called penance, he does not syn,
but he shall suffer the pains in Purgatory. But these sentences or textes
without doubt be sentences apperteynyng unto this life, Do ye penance, Do ye
worthy fruits of penance, Give your members to do service unto ryghtuousnes:
Ergo, they can not be wrested and applied to satisfactions, which may laufully
be refused. For it is not laufull to refuse the precepts of god. The iij.
reason.
Thyrdly, Indulgences or pardones do release those satisfactions, as the
chapitre Cum er eo does teach. But indulge^ces do not loose us from these
precepts, Do ye penance: Do ye the worthy fruits of penance. Wherefore it is
manifest, that those sayenges of scripture be evil applied to canonical
satisfactions. Consydre moreover, what ensues, if the pains of Purgatory be
satisfactio^s or satispassions (as they call them) or if satisfactions be a
redemynge of the pains of Purgatory: do these sentences also command, that
souls should be punyshed in Purgatory? Sith this does necessarily follow of
the opinion of our adversaries: these sentences, Do ye worthy fruits of
penance / and Do ye penance, must be interpreted after a another manner, than
in this wise: Suffer ye the pains of Purgatory after this life. But I am weary
to confute these peuyshe imaginations of our adversaries, with any mo words.
For this is certain and undoubted, that the scripture does speak of works
that be due, of the hole newnes of life, and not of these obseruynges of works
not due, whereof our adversaries speak. And yet with these feigned imaginations
the orders of friars do defend the selling of masses, and infinite
obseruaunces, that is to wit, because they be works satisfieng, if not for
the offense or sin, yet at least for the pain or punysheme^t of sin. For
asmoche therefore as the scriptures alleged do not say, that eternal pains
ought to be redeemed with works not due: our adversaries do folyshelye and
temerariously affirm, that the said pains be satisfied and redeemed by
satisfactions canonical. Furthermore sithe it is most certain, that
remission of sins is a free thing, or is freely given for Christis sake: it
folowethe that satisfactions be not required. And the gospel has a
commandment of forgyuynge sins freely, but not of layenge on punyshementes
and new laws, or of layenge on part, and remittyng a another part. For where
do they read this in the scriptures? Christ speaks of the remission of
sin, when he says: Qui^quid solueris. etc. what soever thing thou shalt
loose upon earth. etc. which being ones forgyuen, eternal death is taken
away, and eternal life is restored.

Neither does Christ speak here of layeng on punyshementes, Qui^quid
ligaueris
when he says, what soever thou shalt bind upon earth. etc. but he speaks
of the reteinyng of their sins, which be not converted. But the saying of
Peter Lumbarde, concerning releasynge of part of the pains, was taken forth
of the canonical punysheme^tes. Part of those pains the pastors or curates
did remitte. Albeit therefore, that we do think that repentance ought to
bring forth good fruits, because of the glory and commandment of god, and
good fruits have the commandments of god for them, that is to wit, true
fastes, true prayers, true almose deeds. etc. yet nevertheless we never find in
the holy scriptures, that eternal pains be not remitted, but for the pain of
Purgatory, or for canonical satisfactions* that is to say, for cetteyne
warkes not due, or that the power and authority of the keys has a warrante
and commandment to change pains, or remitte perte of them. These things
our adversaries ought to have proved. Besides this the death of Christ is not
only satisfaction for the offense or sin, but also for eternal death,
according to that saying of the prophet, Ero mors tua, o mors. I will be thy
death, o death. What a monstrous thing than is it to say, that the
satisfaction of Christ does redeem the sin or offense, and our pains do
redeem eternal death? so that now that saying, I shall be thy death, ought
to be understand not of Christ, but of our works, and that not of works
commanded by god, but of certain cold ceremonies devised by men. Yea and it
is moreover said, that our pains put away everlasting death, even than also,
when they be done in deadely sin. It can not be thought, how great grefe
it is to me, to recite these folyshe and mad imaginations of our adversaries,
which who soever does well consydre, he can not chose but be angrye with
these doctrines offendes. which the devil has sown and spread abroad in the
Church, to oppress the knowledge of the law, and of the gospel, of
repentance, and of vinification, and of the benefits of Christ. For as
concerning the law, thus they say. God, co^descendyng to man's infirmity
has set and ordained to man a measure of these things, unto which he is
bounden of necessity, and that is the obseruyng of the commandments: so
that with the residue of works, which they call works of supererogation, he
may make satisfaction for his offenses and sins. Here they feign, that men
may so work and fulfill the law of god, that they may also do more than the
law does require. But the scripture euerywhere does cry, that we be far
of from that perfection, which the law requirethe. But these fellows do
imagine, that the law of god is contented with outewarde or civil justice,
they se not that it requires the true love of god with all our hertes. etc.
and that it condempneth al concupiscence in nature. Wherefore no man does so
much as the law requires. It is a folyshe thing therefore to feign, that we
may do more than the law requires. For though we may do these outward
warkes, not commanded in the law of god: yet that is a vain and wicked
assurance, to think that we have satisfied and fulfilled the law of god.
Moreover, true prayers, true almose deeds, and true fastes be required by the
commandment of god. And where they be requisite by the commandment of god,
they may not be left undone without sin. On the other part those warkes,
which be not commanded by the law of god, but have a certain form and
fasshyon, by the appoyntement of man, be works of men's traditions, of which
Christ says: They worship me in vain, with the commandments and
traditions of men. As for example. Certain (...) instituted and ordained,
Fastes.
not to the subduyng of the flesh, but to thentent that by ye work an
honor might be rendered to god (as master Duns says) and eternal death
redeemed. Also a certain nombre of prayers, a certain manner and quantity of
almose deeds, when they be done to that entente, that such manner or quantity
should be a service and obsequie to god, even by the reason of the very work
that is wroughte* gyuyng honor unto god, and redemynge everlasting death.
For they say, that these, even of them selves do make satisfaction. For they
teach that they be of strength and auayllable, even in those persons also,
which be in deadely sin. Now these things that follow be further a way
from the commandments of god, Pylgrymages.
I mean pylgrimages / and of them there is great variety / one man makes
his journey in co^plete harneys, another goes his pilgrimage bare foted. These
things Christ does call unprofitable honors or serucies, wherefore they help
not to pacify the wrath of god so as our adversaries do say. And yet these
works be adourne^s, Works of su^e^eroga^ion.
et forth and garnyshed with goodly and gaye tytles, they be called the works
of su^erogatio^, they be had in high honor and be recou^pted the price and
raunsum of everlasting death. Thus they be preferred before the works of the
commandments of god. By reason whereof ye law of god is t^o ways
dishonored, both because it re^eneth that the law of god is satisfied and
fulfilled by outward and civil works, and also because there be added
tradicions of men, the works of which traditions be preferred before the
works of gods law. Furthermore repentance and grace be thereby defaced. For
eternal death is not redeemed with that idle reco^pense of works and which as
yet feleth neither tastes the power of death. Another thing is to be set
against death when it assayleth us. For likewise as the wrath of god is
overcome by faith in Christ: even so is death overcome by faith in Christ,
as Paul says. Thanks be to god, which gives unto us victory by our lord
Jesus Christ. He says not which gives to us victory, if we do set
against death our satisfactions. Our adversaries do handle idle fantasies of
the remission of the gylte or sin, but they se not in what wise ne how in
the remission of the gylte the heart is delivered from the wrath of god, and
from eternal death, Note this argument.
through faith in Christ. Sithe than the death of Christ is satisfaction for
eternal death, and also sithe our adversaries them selves do grant that those
works of satisfactions be works not due, but works of men's traditions, of
which Christ says* that they be unprofitable honors or services: we may
boldly and safely affirm, that papisticall satisfactions be not necessary by
gods law to the remission of the gylte, or to the releasyng of the pain of
Purgatory.

An objection.
But our adversaries do obiecte that vengeance or punyshement is necessary to
repentance, because Augustine says / that repentance is a vengeance
punyshyng. etc^. Likewise as in other places, as ofte^tymes as works be
commanded, our adversaries do interpret those works to be satisfactions and
pacificatio^s: so here because there is mention made of punyshement, they
detorte and wreste it to satifaction. The solution.
But Augustine in this place did not mean, that sorrow in repentance is the
price for which remission of sins is due. For he knew well enough that the
death of Chiste is a sacrifice for all our sins / whatsoever therefore is
alleged of vengeance, or of punyshementes, it ought always so to be
understood, that it overthrow not free remission of sins, ne that it
deface not the merit of Christ / neither that it lead men away from faith
and trust in Christ, to the trust in works. But we do grant, that there is
vengeance or punyshement in penance or repentance, not as a price: but
vengeance is formaliter (as schole men speak) in repentance because the
regeneracion it self is made by perpetual mortification of our oldenes. There
be troubles or fears, there be also other affections which be angry with
sins: and yet is it not they which purchase us remission of our sins. Yea
if faith should not be put unto these sorrows: they should bring eternal
death. Let it be thought a propre saying of M. Duns, that penitencia is called
as a man would say penetene^tia.i. an holdyng of punishment, so that
punishment be not understood to be the price, for which remission is due.
And Augustine also does not speak of the pains or punyshementes which the
keys do remytte. wherefore this saying is not well applied to satisfactions. He
speaks of the true pains that is to wete of the fears and very sorrows of
the mind, which ^e in repentance. And yet for all this we do not exclude
outward vexa^ion and punyshynge of the flesh. For this does willyngly of the
own accord follow the true sorrows of the mind. And our adversaries be far
deceived, i^ they do judge the papisticall or canonical satisfactions to ^e
more truly a pain, then be the true trou^les / fears and sorrows in the
heart. It is a very great folyshnes to wre^te this word (pain) or
(punyshement) to these cold satisfactions and not to refer it to those
horri^le trou^les and fears of the conscience, of which David says.
Circu^dederu^t me dolores mortis. etc. Deadly sorrows have compa^ed me rou^^e
about. who is he yt had not rather go seek the temple of saint James, or the
church of S. Petre having a cote of mayle, orels complete harneys upon him:
tha^ to sustain that unspeakable violence of sorrow, which is even i^ mean
persons, if there be true penance or repe^tau^ce? An other objection
But they say, it is convenient and sittynge for the ryghtuousnes of god to
punyshe syn. First in that they dispute, that it is convenient to punyshe
sin: they declare sufficiently that they despise the benefit of Christ. The
solution.
God has ordained and set a price for our sins, which is not our own
pains, ne our own satisfactions, but the death of his own son. What madness
is it tha^ I pray you, to prefer our own satisfactio^s before the
satisfaction of Christ? Secundarily though god do punyshe sin never so
much, yet we ought to think, that remission of sins is not due for cause
of that punyshement, for fear least we do injury to the benefit of Christ,
and also because the conscience can not be made quiet, if remission should not
chance or come freely. Finally though god punyshe never so much: yet those
punyshementes do nothing at all apperteyne to the keys. These keys have no
commandment, neither of layenge on, ney of remittynge of those pains, which
be the works of god.

How god punishes sins.
But we do grant, that god does punyshe sins, first in co^trition, when in
those great troubles and fears he does show his wrath, as David does
signify, when he says, Lord do not rebuke me in thy furye and wrath. And
Jeremy also when he says, Lord rebuke or chastise me, but yet in judgment
and not in fury: lest thou destroy me, and bring me to nothing. Here truly
he speaks of most bitter and grievous pains. And our adversaries do
confess, that contrition may be so great, that satisfaction is not
requisite, Ergo co^trition is more truly a punysheme^t, than be the
papisticall satisfactions, which be commonly enjoined.

Secundarily, saints and holy men be subject to death, and other comen
afflictions, as Peter says, It is time to begin judgment at the house of
god. And if it begin at us, what manner end shall the end of them be, which
do not believe? And though these be for the most part punyshementes of
sins: yet ne theles in good men they have a another end, for they be laid
upon them to mortify sin present, because in holy men they do quench and
mortify concupiscence. For death to this entente is left in holy men, to
abolyshe and put away this unclean nature. Therefore Paul says, The body is
dead because of sin, that is to say, it is mortified for cause of the
present sin, which is yet left and remains in the flesh. The cross
therefore is not a pain or punysheme^t, but an exercise and a preparation unto
renouation. For when the present sin is mortified, and when in the mids of
temptations, we do learn to seek help of god, and we do prove and find the
presence and aid of god: we more and more acknowledge or recognize the
diffidence of our own hearts, and do lift up our selfs by faith. So
grows the newnes of spirit, as Paul says, Although our outward man be
destroyed, ye^ our inward man is renewed from day to day. Also Esaie says,
The anguyshe in which they do cry, is thy discipline to them. Besides this,
death is than a very punyshement, when the heart thoroughly troubled and made
afraid, does feel and perceive the wrath of god, according to that saying
of scripture. The prycke or stynge of death is sin. But after that in holy
men, the terrors of sin be overcome by faith: death without that feeling of
the wrath of god, is proprely no punyshement. But so it is that the keys do
neither lay on, neither remitte these pains. wherefore satisfactions do not
apperteyne nor belong to these pains. For the keys do not remitte neither
death, neither any part of the comen afflictions. More over if they do redeem
these pains with satisfactions: An other objection of thaduersaries
why do they bid us make satisfaction in Purgatory?

They obiecte against us, Adam, also David, which was punished for hes
adultery. Of these examples they do make an universal rule, that to every syn
is correspondent a propre temporal punyshement, in layeng on the power of the
keys. Before it was said, that holy men do sustain punyshementes which be
the works of god / they susteyn co^tritio^ or terrors / they sustain also
other comen afflictions. The answer.
So some sustain propre punyshmentes laid on them by god, because of example
to other. And these punyshementes do nothing belong to the keys. For the
keys can neither lay them on, neither remitte the^, but god without the
ministry or service of the keys, both does lay them on, and also remitte
them. Neither does this universal rule follow, as to gather in this wise. Upon
David was laid a propre punyshement for his offense: ergo besides the comen
afflictions, there is a certain other pain of Purgatory, in which to every
sin is correspondent a degree of punyshement. Where does the scripture
teach this, that we can not be delivered from eternal death, but by that
recompense of certain pains besides the comen afflictions? Contrarywyse the
scripture does often times teach, that remission of sins does come freelye
for Christis sake / and that Christ is the ouercomer of death and of sin.
Wherefore we ought not to patche unto him the merit of satisfaction. And though
there be afflictions left, yet not withsta^dyng the scripture does judge them
to be mortifications of the sin present, not recompensations of eternal
death, or prices of eternal death. Job is excused, that he was not punyshed
for his offenses committed in times passed: wherefore afflictions be not always
punyshementes, or tokens of wrath. But rather frearefull consciences be to be
taught, that there be other better ends of afflictions: lest else they might
think them selves to be rejected of god, if in afflictions they do se nothing
but punyshement, and the wrath of god. Other better ends I say are to be
considered, as this end, that god does a another man's works, that he may
do his own work. etc. as Esaie does teach in a long sermon. Esa. 28.
And when the disciples did ask Christ, concerning the blind man, who had
sinned: Christ answered, that sin was not the cause of his blyndnes, Johan. 9
but that the work of god might be showed and declared in him. And in Jeremy
it is said, To whom there was no judgment they drynkyng shall drink. etc. As
the prophets were slain, and John^ Baptiste, and other holy men. Wherefore
afflictions be not always punysheme^tes for certain sins done in times past,
but they be works of god appointed to our utility and profit, and that the
power of god should be the more showed, and the better seen and known in our
infirmity. So Paul says* The power of god is made perfect in mine infirmity
and weykenes. Therefore our bodies ought to be sacrifices or oblations, because
of gods will and pleasure, to declare our obedience, and not to make
recompense for eternal death, for which god has a another price, I mean the
death of his son. And after this sentence and meaning does Gregory
interpret also that punyshement of David, S. Gregorye.
when he says, If god for that sin had thretened that he should be so humbled
of his son: why after that the sin was forgyuen, did he fulfylle that,
which he had thretened? It is answered, that that forgyuenes of sin was
done, lest the man should be let to receive eternal life. And that example
of punyshement thretened did follow, that the holiness of the man also in that
humility or affliction might be exercised and proved. So also god did lay
upon man death of the body, because of sin, and after the forgyuenes of
sins, he has not taken away death, for cause of justice to be exercised,
that is to say, that the justice might be exercised and proved of them,
which be sanctified. Neither be the comen calamites and afflictions taken away
proprely by those works of canonical satisfactions, that is to wit, by
those works of men's traditions, which they do say to be of such strength,
by reason of the work that is wroughte, that albeit they be done in deadely
sin, yet they do redeem pains. And when that text of Paul is alleged, If
we would judge our selves, we should not be judged and condemned of the lord:
that word, judge, ought to be understood of the hole repentance, and of the
due fruits, and not of works, which be not due. Our adversaries be well
punyshed for their despysynge of grammar, when they be brought in to this foul
error* to understand that to judge, is as much to say, as to go in complete
harneys on pilgrimage to sayncte James, or to do such like works. To judge,
signifies hole repentance, it signifies to condemn sins. This
co^de^pnation is truly done in contrition, and in the chaungynge of life. The
hole penance, that is to say, contrition, faith, and good fruits, do obtain,
that punysheme^tes, and the comen and private calamities be mitigated, as Esaie
teaches, saying: Cease to do evil, Esaie.
and learn to do well etc. If ^^ti^ sins be as purple: they shall be made as
white as snow. If ye will, and shall hear me, ye shall eat the fruits of the
earth. Neither is that most wayghtye and most wholesome sentence to be
translated from hoolle repentance, and from works due, and by god commanded:
and to be applied unto satisfactions, and works of men's traditions. And it
is profitable to teach this, that the comen punysheme^tes be mitigated by our
repentance, and by the true fruits of repentance, by good works wrought of
faith, and not as these men do feign, wrought in deadly sin. And to this
purpose apperteyneth the ensample of the Ninevites, which with their penance
(we mean of hoolle penance) were reconciled unto god, and did obtain, that
the city should not be destroyed. And as touching to that that general
counsaylles have made Canones, and that the fathers make mention of
satisfaction: we have said here before, that it was an ecclesiastical
discipline, instituted and ordained because of example. Neither did they rhynke
that this discipline is necessary to the remission either of the sin, or else
of the punyshement. For if any among them have made mention of Purgatory,
What purgatory is by faders
they mean not that it is a compensation of eternal pain, nor that it is a
satisfaction: but a purging of imperfect souls* like as Augustine does say,
that venial sins be burnt, Austyne.
that is to say, distruste toward god, and other like affections be mortified.
Some times writers do translate the name of satisfaction from the very rytes or
spectacles, to signify true mortification. So says Augustine, Satisfaction
for mortificatio^
Ver a satisfactio est peccatorum caussas excidere. True satisfaction is to
cut away the causes of sins, that is to wit, to mortify the flesh.
Also to keep under, and tame the flesh, not to thentente that eternal pains
thereby might be recompensed: but least the flesh do draw us unto sin. So
Gregory speaks of restitutio^, that it is false penance, Gregory
if satisfaction be not made to the^, whose goods we hold unjustly. For that
man does not truly sorrow that he has stolen, or that he has done
extorsion: which does yet steal or commit extorsion. For so long is he a
these, or an extorsioner and robber, whiles he is an unjust possessour of a
another man's thing. That civil satisfaction is necessary* because it is
written: He that has stolen, let him not steal from henseforth. Chrysostom
also says, In the heart contrition, Chrysostom.
in the mouth confession, in the hole work humility. This makes nothing at
all against us* Good works ought to follow repentance. Penance or
repentance ought to be not a faynyng, but a change of the hole life in to
better. Also the fathers do write, that it is sufficient, if that open or
sole^pne penance (whereof the canones of satisfactions were made) be done ones
in the life. By which thing it may be well perceived, that they thought those
canones not to be necessary to the remission of sins. For besides that
solemn penance, they will at other times also penance to be done of^e,
where the canones of satisfactions were no^ required. The deuisers and chief
workemaysters of the confutation do write, that it is not to be suffered, that
satisfactions should be taken away, contrary to thexpresse gospel. We therefore
hitherto have showed how that those canonical satisfactions, that is to say*
works not due to be done for the recompensation of eternal pain, have not for
the maintenance of them any warraunt or commandment of the gospel. The
thing it self shewith, if the works of satisfactions be works not due:
wherefore they allege the express gospel. For if the gospel did command
pains to be recompensed by such manner works, than were they works of
duty. But they do so speak, to the^tent to begyle simple and unlearned
persons, and they allege authorities and testimonies, which speak of works
due, where as they in their satisfactions do prescribe works not due. Yea
moreover they them selves do grant in schools, that satisfactions may be
refused without any sin. Wherefore they do here untruly write, that by
thexpresse gospel we be compelled to receive those canonical satisfactions.
But we have often times already witnessed, that repe^tau^ce ought to bring
forth good fruits / and which be good fruits the commandments do teach,
Good fruits.
that is to wit, invocation, thanks gyuyng, co^fessyng of the gospel, to
teach the gospel, to obey our parents, and the rulers and governors, to do
accordyngly to our vocation or calling, to do no murdre, to keep no hatred in
our hertes, but to be mylde and gentle, and to give unto poor and nedye
persons as much as our ability will extend unto, to do no fornication, to
do none adulterye, but to subdue, bridle, and chastise the flesh, not for to
recompense therewith eternal pain, but least it should obey the devil, lest
it should offend the holy ghost. Also to speak truth. These fruits have for
them the commandment of god, and they ought to be done for the glory and
commandment of god, they have also rewards appointed unto them. But that
eternal pains be not remitted, but for the recompense of certain traditions
or of Purgatory, this does not the scripture teach.

Indulgences in old time were forgyuynges of those open obseruaunces, What
were perdons in old time^
that men should not be ouermoche grieved. And if satisfactio^s and pains may
be remitted by the authority of man: than is not that recompensation necessary
by the law of god. For the law of god can not be taken away by man's
authority. Furthermore considering that now that custom and usage is by it
self abolished and grown out of ure (the bishops also them selves dissemblyng
the matter, and wynkynge at the not executynge of them) there is no need at all
of those remissions or pardones. And yet nevertheless the name of pardons has
continued and remained stylle. And likewise as satisfactions were not
understood of the political or civil discipline, but of the recompensation
of pain: even so indulge^ces were wrongely understood, that they do deliver
souls from Purgatory. But the keye has no power but only upon earth, to
bind and louse, according to that saying. What soever thing thou shalt
bind upon earth, it shall be bound in heaven. And what soever thing thou
shalt louse upon earth, it shall be loused also in heaven. How be it, as we have
said before, the keye has not power to lay on punyshementes, o^ to institute
honourynge of god: but only it has commandment to forgive sins unto them,
which be converted, and to rebuke and excommunicate them, which will not be
converted, For as to louse, signifiethe to forgive sins: so to bind,
signifiethe not to forgive sins / for Christ speaks of a spiritual
kingdom. And the commandment of god is, that the ministers of the gospel
should assoyle them, which be converted, according to that text of Paul,
Power and authority is given us to edification. Wherefore the reservation of
cases is a political and ciuil^ thing. For it is a reservation of canonical
punyshement, and not a reservation of sin in the syghte of god, in them
which be truly converted. Wherefore our adversaries do judge well, when they
do grant, that in the article of death, that reservation of cases ought not
to let absolutio^. We have set forth and declared the sum of our doctrine,
as touching penance, which doctrine we know assuredly to be godly and
wholesome to good minds. And good men, if they shall compare our doctrine with
the most confuse and troublesome disputations of our adversaries: shall
perceive right well, that our adversaries have left out the doctrine of
faith, justifying and confortyng godly hertes. For they shall see yt our
adversaries do feign many things of the merit of attrition, of that endeles
rehearsal of sins, and of satisfactions, hanging nothing together, and as the
old proverb is, touching neither heaven ne earth, but strayeng and wanderyng
clean wide from the purpose, and such as even our adversaries them selves can
not sufficiently declare.

Of the number and use of the sacraments.
IN the.xiij. article, our adversaries do allow, that we do say the
sacraments not only to be signs or tokens of profession among men, as
certain men do feign: but rather to be signs and testimonies of the will of
god toward us, by which god moves and styrreth hertes to believe. But here
they bid us also to account seven sacraments. We think that men ought to
beware, that the things and ceremonies instituted in the scriptures be not
despised, how many soever they be. Neither do we think it to make any great
matter, although diverse men for cause of teaching, do nombre or reckon diverse
ways, so that they keep well the things taught in the scripture. For the old
writers have not all numbered them after one manner and facyon. If we call
sacraments rytes or ceremonies, which be commanded by god, and unto which
is added a promise of grace: it is an easy thing to judge, which be proprely
sacraments* For rytes or ceremonies i^stituted by men shall not after this
manner proprely be called sacraments. For it belongs not to the auctorite of
man to promise grace. wherefore signs instituted without the commandment of
god, be not sure and undoubted tokens of grace / albeit peradventure they
teach ignoraunte and simple persons, or else put them in remembrance of
somewhat.

The very sacraments therefore be Baptism, the Souper of the lord, The very
sacraments.
Absolution, which is the sacrament of penance. For these rytes or vsages
have for them the commandment of god / and have also added unto them a
promise of grace, which is proprely belongyng to the new testament. For
hertes ought surely and undoubtedly to believe, that when we be baptized / when
we do eat the body of our lord / when we be assoyled, that god does verily
forgive us for Christ's sake. And god does also by the word and the ceremony
move and stir the hertes to believe and to gather faith, as Paul says,
^ides ex auditu. Faith is by hearing. And likewise as the word runs in to
the ears that it may stryke unto the hertes: even so the ceremony of it self
runs in to the iyes, to move and stir the hertes. The effect of the word
and of the ceremony is all one, as it was full excellently said of sayncte
Augustine, who says, that a sacrament is a visible word, The saienge of
Austine
because the ceremony is received of the iyes, and is as it were a picture of
the word, signifienge the same thing, that the word does signify. wherefore
theffecte of them both is all one.

Confirmation and enneiling.
Confirmation and the last enneylyng be rytes or ceremonies received of the
fathers, which the church does not require as necessary to salvation, because
they have not the commandment of god. wherefore it is not unprofitable to
disseuer these ceremonies from the other above said, which have the express
commandment of god to maynteyne them, and a clear promise of grace.

Preesthode.
Preesthod our adversaries do understand not of the administration of the
word of god, and of the sacraments to be given forth unto other: but they do
understand it of sacrifice, as though in the new testamente there ought to
be a preesthod like unto the preesthode leuitical, commanded by Moses law,
which should make sacrifice for the people, and deserve remission of sins to
other men. We teach that the sacrifice of Christ, dyenge on the cross was
sufficient for the sins of the hole world, and does not need besides, the
help of any other sacrifices, as though it were not sufficient for our
sins. wherefore men be justified not for any other sacrifices, but for that
only sacrifice of Christ, if they believe them selves to have been redeemed with
that sacrifice. Therefore priests be elected and called properlye to teach the
gospel, and to ministre sacraments to the people. Wherefore if order be
understood of the ministratio^ of the word of god, we will not stycke to
call order a sacrament. For the ministration of the word has for it the
commandment of god. And it has many great promises, as in the first
chapitre to the Romans. The gospel is the power of god, to salvation unto every
one that believes. Also Esaie in the.55. chapitre. My word that shall go out
from my mouth shall not return unto me void: but it shall do what soever
things I have willed etc. If order after this manner be understood, we will
not be grieved to call also the imposition or layeng on of the hands a
sacrament. For the church has a commandment to constitute and ordeyne
ministers, which ought to be very acceptable unto us, because we know that
god does approve that ministration, and is present at that ministratio^. And
it is profitable also as much as may be, to garnishe the ministration of the
word with all manner praise against mad men, which dream that the holy ghost
is given not by the word, but for certain preparatio^s of their own, if they
sit idle holding their tongues in dark places, lokyng after illumination /
like as they did in old time which were called enthusiastes which feigned
them selves to be inflate and inspired by the divine influence and power, and
as these Anabaptists do at this day. Now as touching matrimony, Matrimony.
undoubtedly it was not first instituted in the new testament, but forthwith
in the begi^ning after that mankind was created. And it has in mayntenaunce
of it the commandment of god / it has also promyses / but not properly
belongyng to the new testament, but rather apperteynyng to a corporal life.
Where fore if any man list to call it a sacrament: yet he ought to discern and
distinct it from those other above rehearsed, which properly* be signs of the
new testament, and be testimonies of grace, and of remission of sins. That
if matrimony shall therefore have the name of a sacrament, because it has for
it the commandment of god, then other states or offices also which have the
commandment of god, may be called sacraments / as the state of a prince or
governor. Finally, if all things ought to be nombred among the sacraments,
which have no maintain them the commandment of god, and to which promises
be added: why do we not put to prayer, which may most truly be called a
sacrament. For it has not only the commandment of god, but also very many
promises. And set among the sacraments, as it were in a more open and bright
place, does provoke and allure men to pray. Almouse deeds also might be
rekened among them. Also afflictions, which be tokens to which god has
added promyses / but let us pass over these things. For no wise man will
greatly strive about the nombre or the name, so that those things be
reserved and kept, which have the commandment of god and the promyses of
god to maintain and fortifye them. This thing is more necessary, to
understand and know how we ought to use the sacraments. And here we dampne
and utterly dispraise the hole multitude of scolasticall doctors, which
teach, that the sacraments, to him that puts no stop or impedimente of
his own part, do give grace by the virtue of the work that is wrought,
without the good mocion of the heart. This is utterly a Judicial opinion to
think that we be justified by a ceremony without good motion of the heart,
that is to say, without faith. And yet nevertheless this wicked and pestilente
opinion is taught with great authority in all the kingdom of the pope. Paul
cries against it, and denies that Abraham was justified by circumcision, and
says that circumcision was but a token or sign put forth to exercise
faith. So we do teach that in the use of the sacraments faith ought to be
put unto which does believe those promises, and does receive the things
promised, which be offered in the sacrament. And the reason to prove it is
plain and very strong which is this. The promise is unprofitable onles it be
received by faith / but the sacraments be signs of the promyses. Ergo in the
use of the^ faith ought to be put unto. As for example, if any man shall use
the souper of the lord, let him so use it. Because that it is a sacrament of
the new testament, as Christ plainly declares. Therefore let him believe
steadfastly that the things promised in the new testament be given or offered
unto him, that is to wete free remission of sins. And this thing let him
receive by faith / let him comfort and lift up his fearful conscience /
and let him think these testimonies not to be deceitful, but to be so sure
and undoubted as if god with a new miracle did promise from heaven, that he
will forgive. But what should these miracles and promises avail, to him that
does not believe them? And we speak here of special faith which does believe
the present promise, and not only of that faith, which in general does
believe that god is, but which does believe that remission of sins is
offered. This use of sacrament does comfort godly and fearful minds. But
how great a multitude of abuses have been brought up in the church through
that mad opinion of the work wrought, without the good motion of the vser, no
man can with words express. Hereof comes that infinite defoylyng or
profanation of masses / but of this we shall speak here after. Neither can
there any text ne any lettre be brought forth of the ancient writers which
does make with the scholemen in this matter. Austyne.
But rather the contrary S. Austine does plainly affirm who says the
faith or belefe of the sacrament does justify, and not the sacrament. And the
saying of Paul is known. Cord creditur ad iustitiam. With heart we believe to
Justice.

THe.xiiij. article, The xiiii article of calling.
in which we say, that the administrations of the sacraments, and of the
word in the congregation, is to be granted unto no man onles he be in due
form and manner called: they do receive, upon the condition that we do use
canonical ordination or giui^g of orders. Concerning this matter we have in
this assemble oftentimes openly witnessed, that we do with all our hearts
desire to keep the ecclesiastical order and discipline, and the degrees in the
church, even those that be made also by man's auctorite. For we do know, that
for a good and a profitable intent and purpose the ecclesiastical discipline
was ordained by the fathers, after such manner and fashyon as the old ancient
canones do describe. But the byshopes either do compel our prestes to cast
away and to condemn this kind of doctrine, which we have confessed and
acknowledged, orels if they refuse so to do, they do with marvelous strange
cruelty such as has not ben herd, kyl the sely pore men and that gyltles.
These causes do let that our prestes can not know these men for bishops. So
the cruelty of bishops is the cause, wherefore the canonical order or
discipline is some where dissolved, and not observed, which we did greatly
desire to keep. Advise them, how they will make acco^ptes to god, for that
they do in these wise disseuer and dissipate the church. Our consciences in
this matter be clean out of danger and ieoperdy. For sithe we know our
confession to be true, godly, and catholyke: we ought not to approve the
cruelty of them, which do persecute this doctrine. And we know yt the church
is among those* which teach the word of god well and truly* and which
ministre the sacraments well and duly: and not among them, which not only
with their decrees go about to put away the word of god, but also sley the^
that teach well and truly. To whom yea doing any thing contrary to the
canones, yet the very canones them selves be a great deal more gentle and
favorable. And here again we do openly make protestation, that we shall gladly
observe and keep the order and discipline of the church, and of the canones,
upon condition that the bysshoppes cease to rage and use this cruelty against
our congregations. This our mind and will both before god, and among al
nations, shall excuseys to al them that shall come after us / so yt it can not be
laid to our charge ne any fault can be put in us, that the authority of
bysshoppes is minished and enfebled: when men shall read and hear that we,
albeit we desire the bysshoppes not to use this unjust cruelty toward us,
yet can we i^ no wise obtain any manner equity or right of them.

Of man's traditions in the church.
IN the.xv. article, they receive the first part, in which we say that those
rites and ceremonies in the church are to be observed, which may be observed
with out any syn, and which help to the keeping of tranquilite and good order
in the church. The second part they utterly condemn, in which we say, that
man's traditions instituted to appeace god, to merit grace / and to satisfy for
sins be contrary to the gospel. Albeit in our confession concerning the
choice of meares, we have spoken many things enough of traditions: yet this
natwithsta^ding certain things shall here brefly be repeted. For although we
thought, that our adversaries would for other causes defend the traditions of
men: yet we did not think, that ever they would have condemned this our
article / which is. That we deserve not forgiveness of si^nes, or grace through
the obseruyng of men's traditions. Sith therefore this article is condemned:
we have an easy and a plain cause. Now our adversaries do openly play the
Jews, and do openly oppress the gospel with deuillyshe doctrines. For than
does the scripture call tradicions the doctrines of deuyls: when it is taught,
that they be services profitable to deserve remission of sins, and grace. For
then they endymme the gospel, they minishe the benefit of Christ they annulle
the justice of faith. The gospel teaches us, that we through faith for
Christ's sake freely receive remission of sins, and be reconciled to god. Our
adversaries contrary wise make another mediator, that is to wete these
traditions. For the traditions sake, they will obtain remission of sins, by
these they will appease the wrath of god. But Christ says openly, They
honor me in vain with the commandments of men. We have herebefore largely
disputed, that men be justified through faith, when they believe that they
have god pacified, not for our works, but frelye for Christ. This is
undoubtedly the doctrine of the gospel, for Paul says plainly to the
Ephesians, Ephe. 2
Ye be freely saved through faith, and that not of your selves, it is the
gift of god, and co^methe not of men. Now our adversaries say, that men
deserve remission of sins by these humane obseruaunces. What other thing is
this, than besides Christ to set up a another iustifier, a another mediator?
Paul says to the Galathians, Ye be fallen from Christ, Gala. 5
ye which be justified by the law* that is to say, if ye think, that by the
observing of the law, ye deserve to be accounted ryghtuous in the sight of
god: Christ shall nothing avail you. For whereunto need they Christ, which
think them selves to be ryghtuous by their own observing of the law? God
has set forth Christ unto us, that for this mediators sake, and not for our
justices sake, he will be merciful to us. But these men think, that god is
pacified and made merciful for our traditions sake and not for Christ's sake.
They take therf^^e ^om Christ the honor and prerogative of a mediator. Neither
is there any difference betwyxte our traditions, and the ceremonies of Moses
law, as concerning this matter. Paul therefore condempneth the ceremonies of
the law of Moses, likewise as he condempneth traditions, because they were
judged to be works, which did merit justice in the sight of god, by reason
whereof the benefit of Christ, and the justice of faith were obscured.
wherefore he puts away the law, he puttethe away traditions, and proves
plainly, that not for these works sake, but for Christis sake remission of
sins is freelye promised, so that by faith we receive it. For asmoche
therefore as by faith ne receive remission of sins / and sith through faith
we have god merciful and favorable to us for Christis sake, it is plain
error and heresy to decree, that by these obseruau^ces we deserve remission of
sins. If any man do here say, that we deserve not by these traditions
remission of sins, but that we being already justified, do by these traditions
deserve grace: here again Paul cries against him, saying that Christ should
be the minister of sin, if after justification it were to be thought, that
afterward we be not reputed ryghtuous for Christis sake, but that first we
ought by other observations to deserve to be reputed ryghtuous. Also to a
testament made by man, nothing ought to be added: Ergo to the testament of
god, which promysethe that for Christis sake he will be merciful unto us, it
ought not to be added, that first by these observations we ought to merit to
be reputed acceptable and ryghtuous. Howbeit, whereto nedethe any long
disputation? No tradition has been instituted by the holy fathers, for this
intent, that it should merit forgyuenes of sins: but they have been
instituted for cause of good order to be had in the church, and for cause of
tra^quilitie. And though any man would institute certain works to deserve
remission of sins or ryghtuousnes: how shall he know that those warkes
please god, when he has no testimony or witness of the word of god? How
shall he make men assured of the will of god, without the commandment and
word of god? Does not god euerywhere in the prophets forbydde to institute
any peculiar manner of honor or service without his commandment? In Ezechiel
it is written thus. Eze. 20
In the precepts of your fathers do ye not walk, neither do ye keep their
judgments, ne be ye polluted with the ydoles of them, I am your lord god*
walk in my precepts, and keep my judgments, and work ye them. If it be
laufull for men to institute worshyppynges or service, and by the said
services they merit grace* than shall the honourynge and service of all
nations be to be allowed / than the honors instituted by Ierohoam, and other
without the law, shall be to be approved. For what difference is there? if it
has been laufull for us to institute services profitable to merit grace or
justice: why was not the same thing laufull to the gentyles, and to the
children of Israel? But therefore were the honors of the Gentyles and of the
Israelites disalowed, because they thought them selves by the said honors to
merit remission of sins and justice, and did not know the justice of faith.
Finally, whereby be we made sure, that honors or services instituted by men,
without the commandment of god do justify? For of the will and pleasure of
god, nothing can be affermed without the word of god. What if god does not
accept ne allow these services? How than do our adversaries afferme, that
they justify, sithe this thing can not be affermed without the word and
testimony of god? And Paul says, To. 14
that all that is not of faith is sin. But sith it is so that these
obseruaunces have no testimony of the word of god, the conscience must needs
doubt, whether they please god and be acceptable to him or no.

And what need many words in a thing that is manifest and open? If our
adversaries do defend these honourynges invented by men, The kyngedome of
Antichrist.
as things deseruyng justification, grace, and remission of sins, they do
plainly buyld up the kingdom of Antichriste. For the kingdom of Antichrist is
a new manner of honourynge devised by the authority of man, reiectynge
Christ, Likewise as the kyngedome of Mahomete has honourynges, has works,
by which it will be justified before god, and does not think that men be
justified in the sight of god freely through faith for Christ's sake. So also
the papacy shall be a part of Antichristis kingdom, if it does so defend
worshyppynges inverted by men, that they do justify. For the honor and
prerogatyue of Christ is abbrydged, when they teach, that we be not freelye
justified through faith for Christ's sake, but by such manner obseruau^ces.
And namely when they teach, that such manner obseruau^ces and ceremonies be
not only profitable, but also necessary to justification / as their opinion
was herebefore in the.viii. article, where they condemn us, because we said
that it is not necessary to the unity of the church, that there be in all
places like and one manner obseruaunces and ceremonies instituted by men. Daniel
the prophet signifies and gives knowledge, that new fashyons of worshyppes
invented by men, Of Antichrist.
shall be the very form and state of Antichristis kingdom. For thus he says,
He shall honor the god Maosis in his own place, Dan. 11
and the god, which his fathers never knew: shall he worship with gold and
silver, and precious stones. Here he describes new fashyons of honoring god,
for he says, that such manner god is worshypped as the fathers have not
known. For albeit that the holy fathers also have had ceremonies and
traditions: yet they did not think, that these things be profitable or
necessary ^o justification, they did not mynyshe the glory and the benefit
of Christ, but they taught that we be justified through faith for Christis
sake, and not for those humane traditions and ceremonies. But they did observe
the traditions of men for a corporal utility yt the people should know, what
time they ought to come together / and that all things should be done ordrely
and sadly in the churches, because of example. Finallye, that the common people
also should have a certain instruction and discipline. For the diversities of
times, and the variety of ceremonies avails to monyshe the common people.
These causes moved the fathers to observe and keep ceremonies, as Epiphanius
does openly witness in his disputation against the Encratites, Epiphanius.
which did lay upon them selves certain traditions, The Encratites.
they did absteyne from wine, even also in the very ^ouper of the lord. They
did eat no flesh, no neither yet fysshe, in which thing they did far pass
the freres of dominikes order. Marriage they did hate most of any thing,
albeit the company of women they did not hate. For this thing does
Epiphanius lay against them. For they had flocks of women, which followed
the same sort and kind of living that they did, even as at this day the
religious men commonly have monasteries of women nere unto them. And these
obseruau^ces they did imagine to be the true honor and service of god, and to
be justice, for which they were acceptable unto god, and by which they did
pacify the wrath of god. This opinion does Epiphanius disprove, and shows
that there be other ends of the traditions. For he says that traditions ^e to
be praised and allowed, which be made either for temperau^ce, or for civil
governance, that is to say, either to tame and subdue the flesh* for the
instruction of the unlearned persons, or else for a civil order to be had. And
we also judge, that for these causes traditions may be well kept, that is to
say, to thentent that the people should be present at divine service in sobre
wise, so as Iosaphat and the king of Nynyue did by proclamation command
fastes. Also that the order and ceremonies in the church should teach the
unlearned, what is done in every time. Hereof were ordained the Christemas holy
days, the holy days of Easter, and whytson tide, and such other like. This
is it that Epiphanius says, that traditions were instituted because of an
order to be had, and that such order should put men in remembrance of the
history, and of the benefits of Christ. For the tokens or marks of things,
being a^ it were painted and set forth in manners and ceremonies, do more
effectuallye put the common people in remembrance, than do books or wrytynges.
These ends of traditions and ceremonies were profitable to be shewedde to the
people, and to be plainly and openly declared. But to these ends our
adversaries do feign a another end to be joined, through a certain pharisaicall
persuasion, that is to wit, that such manner obseruau^ces do merit remission
of sins. Also that they be services necessary to justification / and that
for them men be accounted ryghtuous in the syghte of god. This plainly is to
honor god with gold, silver, and precious stones, and to think that god is
appeased and reconciled with diversity of garments, of ornaments, and with
other like things, of which there is an infinite number in the traditions of
men, or else to think that such manner tbynges be honourynges of god, I mean
diversities of times, of meats, of vessels, of apparayle. Paul to the
Collossianes writes, that traditions have the semblaunce and lykenes of
wisdom, And in very deed so have they. For that fair order is very semely in
the church, and for that cause is necessary. But man's reason, because it
does not understand the ryghtuousnes of faith: it does naturally imagine
that such manner work? justify men, and that they reconcile god unto us. etc.
Such was the opinion of the comen people among the Israelities, and by the
reason of (...) they did augme^t such man^r ceremonies, (...) they have now
increased with us in Mon^ste^ies. Such is the judgment of man's (...) also*
concerning the exercises of the body, and concerning fastings / whose end
in very deed is to tame and to punyshe the flesh, but yet man's reason does
feign a another end, that is to say, that they be divine honors, which
justify, As Thomas writes, that fasting is auayllable to the putting away,
Thom^s
and to the prohibition of sin. For these be the very words of Thomas. Thus
the semblaunce and apparaunce of wisdom and ryghtuousnes in such manner
works, deceyueth men. Besides this, there be examples of saints / which
whiles men study to follow, they often times follow the outward exercises,
but they follow not the faith of them.

After that this semblaunce of wisdom and justice has begyled men: than
afterward ensue infinite hurtes / the gospel is defaced, concerning the
justice of faith in Christ / and there succedeth in the stead thereof a vain
trust and confidence in such manner works. Afterward the commandments of
god be defaced / and these works do challenge to them selves the title of
perfect and spiritual life, and be far preferred before the works of the
commandment of god / as works of every man's calling / the administration
of the comen weal / the administration of household / the life of married
folks / the bryngyng up of children. These things in comparison of those
ceremonies be judged to be unholy and profane things / in so much that many
men do exercise these things with a certain doubtfulnes and grudge of
conscience. For it is undoubtedly known, that many men have forsaken the
administration and governance of the comen weal, and also have forsaken
wedlock* and have taken them selves to these obseruau^ces, as unto better and
more holy things. Neither is this yet enough, but also when this persuation
is ones fixed in men's minds, that such manner obseruaunces be necessary to
justification: the consciences be sore vexed and troubled, because they can not
perfectely fulfill all obseruau^ces. For what man is a^le to number them all?
There be books out of number, yea hole libraries, which do conteyn never one
syllable of Christ, or of the faith in Christ, nor of the good works
belonging to every man's vocation: but only do gather traditions, and the
interpretatio^s or gloses of them / by which interpretations sometime they be
made more grievous / and sometime they be released and made more easy. How sore
is that good man Gerson troubled, Sylye Gerson pitifulli vexed
whiles he seeks the degrees, and the bredthe of the commandments. And yet
nevertheless he can not set an Epikee or temperament in a degree certain. In
the mean season he does sore lament and bewail the ieoperdies of godly
consciences, which this bitter interpretation of traditions does engendre.

We therefore against this semblaunce of wisdom and righteousness in human
traditions and ceremonies, which begylethe men, let us arm our selves with
the word of god, and first let us know for a suertie, that they neither
deserve remission of sins, ne justification in the sight of god, neither he
necessary to justification / we have alleged certain authorities and
testimonies here before, and Paul is full of them. First to the Colossianes
he says. Let no man judge you in meat, drink, Coll. 2.
or a set holy day, or in the feast of the new moan / or in the sabbot day,
which be shadows of things to come but the body is Christ's. And here he
compriseth both the law of Moses, and also traditions of men, least our
adversaries might by their elusions seem to avoyde these authorities and
testimonies (as they be wont) saying that Paul only speaks of the law of
Moses. But he here clearly witnesses him self to speak of the traditions
of men. Howbeit our adversaries do not perceive what they do say. For if the
gospel denies that the ceremonies of Moses law do justify, which were
instituted by the commandment of god: how much less then do the traditions
of men justify?

Neither have the bishops power and authorite to institute ceremonies as
things justifying or necessary to justification. Yea the apostles say in
the.xv. of the acts, why do ye tempte god, layeng on a yoke. Act. 15.
etc. where Petre does accuse this counsel of ladyng the church, as an
heinous crime and a great syn. And Paul forbyddeth the Galathians to be
brought again under bondage. Gal. 5.
The Apostles therefore will that this liberty do abide in the church lest any
obseruaunces and ceremonies of the law, or of traditions might be judged to
be necessary / so as in the law the ceremonies were necessary for a certain
season, and this liberty they would should remain, lest the justice of
faith might be defaced, if men did judge, that those obseruaunces merit
justification, or else that they be necessary to justification. Many men do
seek Epikees, that is to say, Epikes
moderations and favorable interpretations in traditions, to thentente to
remedy and help consciences / and yet they find not the certain degrees /
wy which they may deliver consciences from these bonds and snares. A propre
similitude.
But likewise as Alexandre did by the knot, called Nodus gordius, which,
because he could not undo, he chopped it a sondre with a sword: so the
Apostles do at ones deliver consciences from traditions / namely if they be
given to deserve justification. Wherefore to be against this doctrine, the
Apostles compelle us, both by their teaching, and also by their examples.
They co^straine us to teach, that traditions do not justify, that they be not
necessary to justification* that no man ought to make or to receive traditions,
with such opinion, that they deserve justification. But if any man observe
them, let him than observe them without superstition, as civil manners or
customs likewise as without superstition men of war have one manner of
apparayle, and scholars a another. The Apostles do break traditions, and
Christ does make their excuse. For an example was to be showed unto the
phariseis* that those obseruaunces were unprofitable. Wherefore if our men do
leave the observing of any traditions, which be not profitable / they be
excused now well enough / for asmoche as the said traditions be required, as
though they did deserve justification. For such opinion in traditions is
wicked and ungodly. But the ancient traditions made in the church for cause
of utility, we do gladly observe and keep / and we interpret them to the
best part and most laudable, excludyng the opinion which thinks that they
iustifye. And our adversaries do wrongefully, and untruly accuse us, that we
do abolyshe and take away the good ordenaunces, and the discipline of the
church. For we may boldly, and truly say, that the publyke and open facyon
of congregations with us is more honest, than it is among our adversaries. And
if any man will truly consydre and way the mattier, he shall find that we do
keep the canones more truly, than do our adversaries. Among our adversaries,
the priests do sing or say masses against their wylles, hired with money, and
for the most part only for their hyre or wages sake. They sing psalms, not
to thentent to learn, or pray: but because to do honor and service to god, as
though that work were an honor to god, or at the least wise, they do it for
their wages sake. With us many do use the souper of the lord every Sunday, but
they be first instructed, examined, and assoyled. Children do sing psalms,
that they may learn, the people also syngen them, to thentent that either they
might learn, or else pray. Among our adversaries there is no instruction of
children at al / of which thing yet the canones do give commandment. With us
the pastors and ministers of the congregations be compelled openly to
enstructe, and to here chyldhod. And this ceremony bri^geth forth very good
fruits. Among our adversaries in many countries throughout the hole year be
made no sermones at all saving only in the lent and yet seldom than. But the
chief honor of god is to teach the gospel. And when our adversaries do
preach, they speak of humayne traditions / of the honoring of saints, and
of such like trifles, which the people be weary of, and not without good cause.
And therefore the people depart and go from them forthwith in the beginning
after that they have rehearsed the text of the gospel. What things be
preached among the Germaynes
A certain few better men do now begin to speak of good works, but of the
justice of faith in Christ / of the consolation and comfort of consciences,
they speak nothing at all. Yea moreover they do rail upon this most wholesome
part of the gospel. Contrariwise in our churches all the sermones be spente in
these comen places, of the fear of god, of faith in Christ, of the justice
of faith of the consolation of consciences through faith / of the exercises
of faith / of prayer, what manner one it ought to be / and that we ought surely
to believe, that it is effectual, and that it is herd, of the cross / of
dignity of princes, and their officers and of the civil ordinatio^s, of the
diversity of the kingdom of Christ or of the spiritual kingdom / and of
polityke or civil things / of wedlock, of the bryngyng up and information of
children / of chastity / of all the offices or works of charity. By this
estate of churches, it may be judged that we do diligently observe the
ecclesiastical discipline and godly ceremonies, and good customs of the
church. And concerning mortification of the flesh, and discipline of the
body, thus we teach (as our confession does show) that true and unfeigned
mortificatio^ is done by the cross, and by such afflictions wherewith god
does exercise and try us. In these we must obey the will and pleasure of god,
as Paul says. Give your bodies an holt or sacrifice. etc^. And these be the
spiritual exercises of fear and faith. But besides this mortificatio^ which
is done by the cross, there is also a certain volu^tary kind of exercise
necessary, whereof Christ does say. Beware that your hearts be not made heavy
through superf^uitie of meat and drink. And Paul says. I do chastise my
body, and do bring it into bondage* etc^. And these exercises be to be taken
upon us, not for that they be honors or services iustifie^g us, but to
thentent, that they may keep the flesh under / least fulness do oppress us,
and do make us recheles and without fear / of which thing it comes to pass
that men do follow and obey the affections and desires of the flesh. This
diligence ought to be continual, because it has a co^tynual commandment of
god. And that precyse form and manner of certain meats, and times prescribed
and commanded, helps nothing at all to the keeping under and subduing of the
flesh. For it is more delicate and more costly, then be other dyners and
suppers. And not so much as our adversaries them selves do observe the form
and manner which is taught in the Canones. Traditions be snares of the
conscience.


This place of traditions has many and that hard disputations / and we have
proved and found by very experience* that tradicions ar very snares of the
consciences. When they be required as necessary they do meruaylously tormente
and vex consciences that forget or leave any obseruaunce or ceremony undone.
Again the abrogation of the^ has certain inco^modities, and certain
questions belongyng unto it. But we have a plain, and an easy cause, because
our adversaries do condemn us, for that we do teach that traditions of me^ do
not merit remissyon of sins. Also they do require general or universal
traditions (as they call them) as necessary to iustifycation. Here we have a
bold and a steadfast defe^der / we mean Paul, which every where affermeth
that these obseruaunces do neither iustifye, nether be necessary above and
besides the iustifycation of faith. And yet nevertheless we do show, that the
use of liberty in thies things is in such wise to be moderated and measured,
that unlearned men be not offended, ne for the abuse of the liberty made less
favorable unto the true doctrine of the gospel, and that without reasonable
and probable cause nothing be changed in the accustomed and usual
ceremonies, but that the ancient custumes be observed and kept for the
norishment of concord namely such as may be kept with out sin or without any
great hurt or incommoditie. And even in this same present assemble or
perliame^t we have showed and protested that we will for charities sake, with
good will observe indifferent things with other men, although they had some
inco^moditie in them. For the publyk and common concord, as far forth as may
be done without offendyng of consciences we have judged to be preferred before
all other commodities or profetes. But of this hole matter we shall speak also
not long here after, when we shall dispute of vows, and of the
ecclesiastical power.

Of things politic.
THe.xvj. article our adversaries do receive without any exception, in which
we did confess, that it is laufull for a christen man to bear office / to
exercise judgments / according to the laws of emperors or kings or
according to other p^sent laws / to set and appoynte ponishementes by the
law, to keep war ryghtfully / to make bargaynes by the law / to keep
somewhat as propre or several / to take an oath, when it is required of the
rulers and governors, to co^tracte matrimonye, finally that laufull civil
ordinances be good creatures of god / and the ordinances of god, which a
christen man may saffely use. This hole place of the diversity of the kingdom
of Christ, and of the civil kingdom, has been profitably set forth to
light by the wrytinges of our learned men / that the kingdom of Christ is
spiritual, that is to wete, beginning to work in the heart knowledge of god
/ fear of god / faith / eternal justice / and eternal life. And in the
mean season it does suffer us outwardly to use the civil ordinances that be
lawefull, of whatsoever nations they be among whom we do live, likewise as it
sufferith us to use phisike, carpe^ters craft, meat, drink, the air. Nether
does the gospel make new laws of the civil state, but it commands that
we obey the present laws whether they have been made by hethen and not
christeined men, or else by other / and with this obedience it byddeth us to
exercise charity. For Carolostadius was mad which did lay upon us the
Judicial laws of Moses. Carolostadius
Of these things our men have therefore written the more ple^tuously, because
monks and freers have sparcled many pestilent opinions in to the church. They
called it the evangelical policy or governance to have all things in
common / they said, that these be counsayles, not to keep any thing propre /
not to revenge. These opinions do greatly deface the gospel and the spiritual
kingdom / and they be perilous to commonweals. For the gospel does not
destroy the good order of a city, or of an house: but much rather does
approve and allow it / and does bydde us not only for fear of punyshement,
but also for consciences sake, to obey them as being the ordenaunce of god.
Iuliane the apostata, Iulianus and Celsus
Celsus, and very many other have objected against christen men, that the
gospel does destroy commonweals / because it does forbid vengeance / and
does teach certain other things nothing mete ne agreinge to the civil
societe and fellowship. And these questions have merueilously troubled Origin,
Gregori Nazanzen, and other, when verily they easily may be dissolved, if we do
know, that the gospel gives no laws concerning the civil state, but that
it is forgyuenes of sins and a beginning or in choation of eternal life in
the hearts of al beleuers. But as for outward orders of commonweals it does
not only approve them, but also does make us subject unto them. Likewise as we
be necessarily subject to the laws of times to the change of winter and
somer, as unto the ordenaunces of god. The gospel does forbydde private
vengeance. Why Christ forbyddeth private ve^geau^ce.
And this thing for this purpose Christ does so often inculke and repete:
that the apostles should not think that they ought to take away thempire from
the^, which held it / so as the Jews did dream of the ki^gdome of Messiah,
but yt they should know that they ought to teach and preach of the spiritual
kingdom, and not to change the civil estate. So than private vengeance is
forbeden, not by counsel, but by precepte and commandment, in the.v.
chapitre of Matthue, and in the.xij. to the Romans. The comen vengeance or
punyshement, which is done by the office of the governor is not for bid ne
dissuaded: but is commanded, and is the work of god, according to the saying
of Paul in the.xiij. chapitre to the Romans. And certain kinds of public
vengeance be the judgments, ponyshementes, wars, and batayles. Of these
things, how evil many writers have judged, it is evident and plain / for
they have been in this error and wrong opinion, that the gospel is a certain
new outward and monastical policy or order of a comen weal / and they did
not see, that the gospel does bring eternal justice to the hertes, and
outwardely does approve the civil estate. This also is a very false lie, that
it is christen perfection, not to keep any thing propre. For the christen
pfection does not stand in the contempt and despisyng of civil ordenau^ces:
but in the motions of the heart, in the great fear of god, in great faith, as
Abraham, David, Daniel, even in those great riches and empires were no less
pfecte, than any heremites. But monks and freres have cast that outward
hypochrisy before the yies of men, lest else men might se in what things
stands true perfection. O lord god with what praises have they magnified the
communion of things, as a thing evangelical? But there is much ieoperdy in
these praises, namely, since they be far disagreing from the scriptures. For
the scripture does not command things to be comen. But the Decalogie, that
is to say, the law of the ten commandments, when it says (Thou shalt
do no theft) makes a division, pertition, or seueraunce of possessions and
dominions, and commands every man to keep that thing, which is his own.

wyclefe
Undoubtedly Wyclefe was mad, which said, that it was not laufull for
priests to have any thing propre. There be also infinite disputatio^s of
co^tractes and bargaynes, with which, good consciences can never be satisfied,
onles they know this rule, that it is laufull for a christen man to use the
civil ordenaunces and laws. This rule stays the consciences, when it
teaches that bargaynes be so farforthe laufull in the syghte of god, as long
as the gouerners or laws do approve them. All this hole place of polytyke or
civil things, has been so opened and set forth of our teachers, that very
many good men, which be busyed and occupied in the comen weal, and in
worldly busynesses, have openly said, that they have been greatly helped,
which before did doubt (being vexed with the opinions of monks and freres)
whether the gospel did permyt and suffer those civil offices and busynesses
yea or no. These things we have therefore rehearsed, that even strangers also
may understand, that by this kind of doctrine, which we do follow, the
authority of rulers, governors, and officers, and also the dignity of all
civil ordenaunces is not ^ynyshed ne enfebled, but rather strengthed and
fortified. The renown and authority of which things was before with folyshe
opinions of monks and freers meruaylously defaced / which did far prefer
the folyshe and most vain hypochrisye of poverty and humility, before the
order of a City, or of an house / where as in very deed the ordering and
administration of a realm, or of a city, and the ordering of an house, has
for it the commandments of god / but that platonical co^munitie of all
things has not for it the commandment of god.

THe.xvij. article our adversaries do receive without exception, The.17 article.
in which we confess, that Christ shall appear in the end of the world, and
shall raise up again all dead men / and shall render unto good men eternal
life, and eternal joys, and shall condemn wicked men to be tourmented
perpetually with the devil.

Of frewyll.
THe.xviij. article concerning frewyll our adversaries do receive, The.18
article.
howbeit they add auctorities and testimonies little mete or agreynge to that
matter, they add also a declamation, that we ought not to extolle ne magnify
frewyll ouermoche with the Pelagianes, neither yet to take away all manner
liberty from it with the Manichies. Gayly well said forsothe, but what
difference is there betwyxte the Pelagianes and our adversaries: sithe it is
so, that they both do think, that men may without the holy ghost, both love
god, and fulfill the commandments of god / as touching to the substance of
the acts or deeds, and merit grace and justification with works / which
reason by her self does work without the holy ghooste. How many folyshe and
inconvenient things do ensue of these Pelagianical opinions, which be taught
with great authority in schools? These opinions Augustine following saint
Paul, does vehemently confute, whose sentence and mind we have recited here
before in the article of justification. Neither do we take away liberty from
man's will. Man's will has liberty in chosyng of works or things, which
reason does comprehend and perceive by her self. Man's will may some manner
way work civil justice or the justice of works / it may speak of god / it
may give unto god certain honor or service with ye outward work, it may obey
governors and rulers / it may obey father and mother, in choosing of the out
ward work / it may hold her hands from murdre / from adultery / from
theft. Sithe there is left in the nature of man reason and judgment of
things sensible: there is left also a choice of these things, and a liberty
and power to work civil justice. For y^ does the scripture call the justice of
the flesh: which justice carnal nature, that is to say, reason does work
by her own self, without the holy ghooste / howbeit the strength of
concupiscence is so great, that men do more often obey and follow lewd
affections, than the right judgment. And the devil, who has great power
over wicked persons (as saint Paul says) does not cease to stir and
provoke this weyke nature unto diverse and sundry sins. These be the causes,
wherefore even civil justice also is so seldom a thing among men, that as ^e
do see, not the philosophers them selves have attained it, which seem to have
greatly desired it. But this is a false saying, to say, that man does not
sin which does the works of the commandments out of grace. And they
add also more, that remission of sins and justification is due of necessity
to such manner works. For the hertes of men without the holy ghost, be
without fear of god, without trust toward god / they do not believe, that
they be herd of god, that their sins be forgyuen, that they be helped and
saved of god. Therefore they be wicked. But so it is, that an evil tree can not
bring forth good fruits, And without faith it is impossible to please god.
Wherefore although we grant unto frewyll liberty and power to work the
outward works of the law: yet we grant not to frewyll power to work
spiritual works, that is to wit, to dread god truly, to believe and trust
in god truly, to decree with it self truly, and to think yt god does
look upon us, does hear us, does forgive us. etc. These be the very works
of the first table, which man's heart can not work without the holy
ghooste, as Paul says. The natural man, (that is to say, man using only
his natural powers) does not perceive those things, which be of god. And
this may be judged, if men consydre how the hertes do think of the will of
god / whether they do verelye decree with them selves, that they be favored
and herd of god. This faith, it is an herd thing even for holy men also to
keep and hold fast: ergo much less it is in wicked men, and it is received
(as we said before) when hertes thrughly made affrayde, do hear the gospel,
and do take consolation and conforte. This distribution therefore or division is
profitable, in which civil justice is assigned and given to frewyll, and
spiritual justice to the governance of the holy hhoste, in them that be
regenerate and borne again in Christ. For so is kept and retained good order
and discipline. For all men ought to know both that god does require that
civil justice, and that we be able after a certain manner to perform and
fulfill it. And yet nevertheless there is showed the diversity betwyxte civil
justice, and spiritual justice, betwyxte philosophical justice, and the
doctrine of the holy ghost / and it may be perceived where we have need of ye
holy ghost. Neither is this division first invented by us* but the scripture
does most evidently teach it. Augustine also treats of the same / and of
late days it was very well handeled of Wyllyam of Parrhise, Austine
but it is ungraciously and wyckedly trodden under foot, william of Parrhise.
and oppressed by them, which have dreamed, that men may obey the law of
god, without the holy ghost. And that the holy ghoost is given there where is
respect of merits.

Of the cause of sin.
THe.xix. article our adversaries receive in which we confess, The.19 Article
of the cause of sin.
that although one god alone has created and made all nature, and does
conserve and keep all things that be: yet that notwithstanding, the cause of
sin is in the devil and men, a will turnynge it self away from god,
according to the saying of Christ, of the devil. Cum loquitur mendacium ex
propri^s loquitur. When he speaks a lie: he speaks of his own.

Of works.
IN the.xx. article, The.21 article.
they put these words expressly, that they do reiecte and disalowe our
saying, that men do not merit forgyuenes of sins by good works. This
article they do say openly and plainly, that they do reiecte and disalowe.
What is to be said in a matter so manifest? Here the workmaysters of the
confutation do openly show and declare, with what spirit they be moved and
led. For what is more certain and undoubted in the church, tha^ that
forgyuenes of sins comes freely for Christ's sake / and that Christ is the
mercy stock for our sins, and not our works, as Peter says, Act. 10
To him all the prophets bear witness, that in his name, al they that believe
in him, do receive remission of sins. To this church of the prophets let us
assente and agree, rather than to these ungracious writers of the co^futation,
which so boldly without shame blaspheme Christ. For although there have been
certain writers, which have thought, that after the remission of sins, men
be ryghtuouse in the syghte of god, not by faith, but by the self works: yet
did they never think this, that the remission of sins does come for our
works sake, and not freelye for Christis sake. Therefore this blasphemye is not
to be suffered, that the honor of Christ be given and translated to our
works. These divines be ashamed of nothing, if they dare pronounce such manner
sentence in the Church. And we do not doubt, but that the Emperors majesty,
and the most part of the princis, would in no wise leave this place
remaining in the confutation, if they were admonyshed.

We could in this place recite infinite authorities and testimonies of the
scripture, and of the fathers: but we have said many things alredye of this
matter heretofore. And there is no need to rehearse many testimonies unto him,
which knowethe wherefore Christ was given unto us / and which knows yt
Christ is ye mercy stock for our sins. Esaie says, The lord has laid on
him the iniquities of us. Our adversaries do teach the contrary, that god
does lay our iniquities not on Christ, but on our own works. Neither it
lustethe me here to tell what manner works they teach. We do se an horrible
decree to be made against us, which should fear us a great dele more, if we
did strive about doubtful or tryflynge matters. But now for asmoche as our
consciences do understand and know, that our adversaries condemn the
manifest truth, the defense whereof is necessary to the hole church / and
does amplify and set forth the glory of Christ: we easyly despise al
terrors and punyshementes of the world, and with a bold mind we shall abide
and suffer, if any thing is to be suffered for the glory of Christ, and for the
utility of the church. For I pray you who would not be glad to die in the
confession of these articles, that we do freely obtain remission of sins by
faith for Christis sake, and that by our works we do not merit remission of
sins? The consciences of godly men shall have no sure and strong consolation
against the terrors of sin and death, and against the devil, temptyng and
provoking to desperation: if they do not know, that they ought to be
assured, and to decree with them selves, that they have remission of sins
freelye for Christis sake. This faith holds up, comforts, and quickens
hearts in that most sharp battle of desperation. This is therefore a cause
worthy, wherefore we should refuse no manner ieoperdy. Thou therefore, whosoever
thou be, that doste agree and assent to our confession: shrynke not for any
persecutions or punyshementes / step forth the more boldly, when the
adversaries go about with fears, with torments, with punyshmentes to take
from the this so great consolation, which is offered and propouned to all the
hole church in this our article. If thou sekest, thou canste not lack
testimonies and authorities of scripture, which shall establishe thy mind. For
Paul with full voice (as they say) in the third and fourth to the Romans, To
3.4
cries out that sins be freely forgiven for Christ's sake. Therefore (says
he) we be justified by faith and freely, that the promise should be ferme and
stable, that is for to say, if the promise did hang upon our works, it
should not be firm and stable / if remission of sins were given for our
works, when should we know, that we had gotten remission? when should the
troubled conscience find a work which he were assured to be sufficient to
appease the wrath of god? But we have spoken before of the hole matter, and
from thens let the reader take testimonies. For the unworthiness and shamefulnes
of the thing has enforced and compelled us to make this complaynt and be
waylyng rather then a disputation, because in this place they have spoken
expressly, that they do disalowe our article where we say, that we obtain
remission of sins not for our own works, but by faith and freely for
Christ's sake. Our adversaries also do add testimonies and authorities to
their conde^pnatio^. And it were good to rehearse one or two of them. 1. Pe. 1.
They allege of Peter. Studete firmam facere uocationem uestram.i. Study ye to
make your calling stable and sure. etc^. Thou see here reader, that or
adversaries have not lost their labors in learning of logyke / but that they
have craft to reason and conclude of the scriptures even what soever they
list. Make your calling ferme and sure by good works: ergo works deserve
remission of si^nes. Uerely this same shall be a very feate argument, if a man
should reason thus of one, which had deserved death and were perdoned of it.
The king commands, that from hensforthe thou doste hold thy hands from
other men's goods: go thou have deserved pardon of thy punisheme^t by these
that thou doste now steal none other men's goods. To reason after this
fashyo^* is to make the cause of that which is not the cause. For Peter
speaks of works following remission of sins, and he teaches wherefore they
ought to be done, that is to wete, that the calling might be sure and stable,
that is for to say, that they do not fall from their calling, if they do syn
again. Do good works, that ye may continue in your calling, least ye lose
the gifts of calling which ye had before not for the works following, but they
be now retained and kept by faith, and faith does not abide in them, which
lose the holy ghost, and which do cast away repentance, as we said before,
that faith stands in repentance. They add other authorities hanging not
much better together. And in conclusion they say, that this opinion was
condemned more then a thousand years paste in the time of Augustine. This
also is a false lie. For the church of Christ has always thought, that
remission of sins comes freely. But on the contrary side the Pelagians were
condemned, which did stiffly affirm, The Pelagianes.
that grace is given for our works. But we have showed sufficiently here
before, that we think, that good works ought of necessity to follow faith.
For we do not (says Paul) take away the law, but we do establyshe it, Romans
3.
because sith with faith we have received the holy ghost, there follows
necessarily the fulfyllynge of the law, which does continually encreace more
and more, as love, patience, chastity, and other fruits of the spirit.

Of the invocation of saints, or prayeng unto them.
The.21 article.
THe.xxj. article they do utterly condemn, that we do not require the
invocation of saints / and in no place do they play the Rhetoricians more
largely tha^ here. And yet they conclude no thing else, but that saints be to
be honored and worshypped. Also that saints which be alive, do pray for
other men as who should say that therefore it is necessary to pray unto the
saints, that be dead. They allege Cypriane, Cypan.
that he did desire Cornelius being a live, that when he should depart he
would pray for his brethren. By this example they prove the invocation of
dead sai^tes They allege also Hierome against Uigilantius. Hierom
In this matter (say they) Hierome overcame Uigilantius more then eleven
hundred years ago. Thus our adversaries do triumph as though they had won y^
field, and the warr^ were all at an end. Neither do these asses se, that in
Hieroms writing against Uigilantius there is not one syllable of invocation. He
speaks of the honors of saints, not of invocation. Neither did any of the
old writers before Gregory make mention of invocation. Doubtless this
invocation with these opinions which our adversaries do now teach of the
application of merits, Three manners of honorynge saints
has no testimonies ne authorities of old writers.

Our confession does allow the honors of saints. For these three manners of
honor are to be allowed and commended. The first is giving of thanks / for
we ought to give thanks to god, that he has showed examples of mercy, that he
has given us knowledge that he is wyllyng to save men, that he has given
doctors / or other gifts to the church. And these gifts (as they be are
very great) so they be to be amplified and extolled, and the saints them
selves be to be praised, which did use these gifts faithfully / even as
Christ does commend the faithful merchants and occupiers of the talentes
delivered to them. The secounde manner of worship is the confirmation of our
faith, as when we se, that to Peter is forgyuen the denieng of his master: we
also be comforted and lift up to believe the rather that grace is far above
sin. The third honor is, the Imitation and following, first of their
faith, and then of their other virtues, which every one ought to follow
according to his calling. These true honors our adversaries do not require /
but only about invocation and prayeng unto the^ they braule and chyde, which
although it had no ieoperdy in it, yet it is not necessary.

Moreover this we grant also, Angels pray for us.
that aungelles do pray for us / for there is an authority in the first of
Zachary, where the aungel does pray in this wise. Lord of arms how long
wi^t thou not have mercy of Jerusalem etc. As concerning saints, though we do
grant, that likewise as when they be alive they do pray for the hole church
in general, even so in heaven they do pray for the church in general. Yet
there is no authority ne testimony i^ the scriptures of dead men prayeng,
only that dream excepted, which is taken forth of the secou^de book of the
Machabies.

But though it were so that saints pray never so much for the church: yet
it follows not that they be to be called upon, and prayed unto. Howbeit our
confession does only aff^rme this, that the scripture does not teach the
invocation of saints, or to desire help of saints. But forasmuch as neither
commandment, neither promise, neither example of praieng to saints can be
brought or alleged out of the scriptures: it follows that the conscience can
have no certayntie ne any assurance concerning that invocation. And sithe it is
so, that prayer ought to be made with faith: how do we know, that god does
accept and allow that invocation? Whereby know we without the testimony of
scripture, that saints do understand and know the prayers and petitions of
every particular person? Some men do make of the saints utterly very gods,
giuinge unto them, that they do se the secret thoughts of the minds in us.
They dispute of the morrow tide knowledge, and the euentyde knowledge,
peradventure because they do doubt, whether they do hear in the morowtyde, or
else in the euentyde. These things they do imagine, not to thentent to put
the saints to worship: but to defend worshypfull gaynes, which come by the
worshyppynge of saints. Our adversaries can bring nothing against this
reason, that in asmoche as invocation of saints has no testimony of the
word of god: it can not be affermed, that saints do understand and know our
invocation and prayer / or though they do know it never so much, that god
does allow it. Wherefore our adversaries ought not to compel us to a thing
uncertain and doubtful. For prayer without faith is no prayer. For as for
thexample of the church, which they do allege: it is undoubtedly known
that this is a new manner and custom in the church. For the old prayers or
collectes, although they make mention of saints: yet do they not pray to the
saints. How be it this new invocation also in the church, is far unlike
the invocation, which every man uses privately.

Furthermore our adversaries not only require invocation in the honoring of
saints, but also they do apply the merits of saints for other men, and do
make of the saints not only intreaters or intercessours, but also
mercygrau^tours or propitiatours. This is in no wise to be suffered. For here
the honor proprely due unto Christ, is utterly taken from him, and given to
the saints. For they make the saints mediators and mercy graunters. And
albeit they make a distinction betwyxte mediators of intercession, A
distinction of mediators.
and mediators of redemption: yet for all that they make plainly of the saints
mediators or means of redemption. And again they have no testimonye of
scripture for them, that saints be mediators of intercession. which word
though it be spoken most shamefastly and measurably: yet nevertheless it does
obscure and deface the benefit of Christ / and it translateth the trust of
mercy due to Christ, unto the saints. For men do feign and imagine, that
Christ is more hard to entreat, and that saints be more gentle and easy to
please, and they trust more on the mercy of saints than on the mercy of
Christ / and fleinge from Christ, they seek to the saints. So they make of
them in very deed mediators of redemption. Therefore we shall show, that they
make verily of saints not only deprecatours, but propitiatours, that is to
say, mediators of redemption* We do not yet recite here the abuses of the
comen people / we do yet speak of the opinions of learned men. The rest even
the unlearned may judge. In a propitiatour these two things must co^curre and
run together. First there must be the word of god, by which we may know
assuredly, that god is willing to have mercy, and to hear those that call on
him, for this propitiatours sake. Such manner promise is there made of Christ,
What soever ye shall ask my father i^ my name he shall give it you. Of the
saints there is no such manner promise. wherefore consciences can not certainly
decree with the^ selves, that we be herd by the invocation of saints.
wherefore that invocation is not made through faith. Furthermore we have a
commandment, that we should call upon Christ, according to that text, Come
unto me all ye that labor: etc. which doubtless was said also to us. And the
prophet Esaie says, Esa. 9.
In that day shall the root of Iesse stand as a mark and sign to the
people / him shall the gentyles pray and beseech. And in the.4.3. psalm. Thy
face shall all the rich men of the people make prayer unto. And in the.71.
psalm. And all the kings of the earth shall worship him. And a little after.
They shall pray in his sight continually. And Christ him self says, Ioh. 5.
That all men may honor the son, likewise as they do honor the father. And
Paul to the Thessalonianes, 1. Thessaloni. 2.
in his prayer says in this wise. And our lord Jesus Crist him self, and god
our father exhort your hertes and establyshe you. etc. But of the invocation
of saints, what commandment, or what example can our adversaries bring of
the scriptures? The second thing that belongs to a propitiator or mercy
gyuer is that his merits be set forth, as which be given to other men by
gods imputation, so that for them they be reputed ryghtuous, as it were for
their own merities. As for example, if one friend does pay another debtes*
the detter is delivered by another man's merit, as though it were by his own.
So the merits of Christ be given to us, that we might be reputed rightuous by
the trust of the merits of Christ, when we believe in him, as though we had
merits of our own. And of both these two, that is to wit, of the promise, and
of the gyuyng of merits, there rysethe trust of mercy. Such manner trust of
gods promise, and also of the merits of Christ, ought to be brought with us
when we entende to pray. For we ought to decree verily with our selves, both
that our prayers be herd for Christis sake, and that by his merits we have
the father appeased and reconciled.

Here our adversaries hyd us first to call upon saints, where as they have
neither promise of god, neither commandment, neither example of the
scripture. And yet they cause men to gather more trust of the mercy of saints,
than of the mercy of Christ, when Christ byddeth us come to him, and not to the
saints. Secu^darily they apply the merits of saints to other men, likewise
as the merits of Christ. They hyd us trust in the merits of saints, as
though we were reputed rightuous for the merits of saints, as we be reputed
ryghtuous for the merits of Christ. We make nothing here of our own heed.
In indulgences and pardons they say that they apply the merits of saints. And
Gabriel the expositour of the canon of the mass says boldly, Gabriel an
expositour.
that we by the order instituted of god ought to flee to the help of saints,
that we may be saved by their merits and prayers.

These be the words of Gabriel: and yet every where in the books and in the
sermones of our adversaries be red much more folyshe things. What is to make
saints graunters of mercy, if this be not? They be utterly made egall to
Christ, if we ought to trust, that by their merits we be saved. And where was
that order instituted by god, which he speaks of, that we ought to flee the
to helps of saints? Let him bring forth an example or a commandment of the
scriptures.

Peradventure they take this order by thensample of kings courts, He
confou^deth the^ with their own example.
where we must make friends to entreat for us. But if the king had appointed
one certain intercessor, solicitour, or maker of means: he would not that
matiers should be brought to him by any other than by him. So sithe Christ is
appointed and set to be intercessor and bishop, why do we seek other? The
common form of absolution.
This form of absolution is used commonly euerywhere, The passion of our lord
Jesus Christ, the merits of the blessed virgin Marie, and of al saints, be
to the for the remission of thy sins. Here is the absolution pronounced, that
not only by the merits of Christ, but by the merits of other saints we be
reconciled and reputed ryghtuous. Certain of us saw a doctor of divinity
dyinge, whom to comfort there was another divine, which was a religious man
sent for, and brought. This co^forter did sing none other song to him that
lay in extremes, but this prayer. Mother of grace defend us from the enemy,
receive us in the hour of death. Let us grant, that our blessed lady does
pray for the church: does she also receive souls at their death? Does she
overcome death? Does she quicken and give life? What does Christ, if our
blessed lady does these things? which although she be most worthy of most
great honors: yet she will not that her self be made egall to Christ, but
she wylleth rather, that we should behold and follow her examples. But
experience teaches that by the common persuation, the blessed virgin is
utterly come in to Christis stead / her men have called upon, and prayed unto /
upon her grace and mercy they have trusted / by her they would pacify Christ,
as though he were not a mercy gyuer, but only a terrible judge, and an
aduenger. But surely we think, that we be justified only by trust of the
merits of Christ, and not by trust of the merits of the blessed virgin, or
of other saints. Of other saints it was said, Every one shall receive their
reward, according to their labor, that is to say, they can not among them
selves give their merits one to another / so as freers and other religious men
do selle the merits of their orders. And Hilarie says of the folyshe virgins
in this wise. Hilarious
And because the folyshe virgins can not go forth to mete the spouse, sithe
their lamps were out: they desired them that were wise, that they would lend
them some of their oil: to whom the wise virgins answered, that they could
lend them none, because peradventure there should not be enough to serve them
al, that is to wit, no man shall be helped with other me^nes works and merits /
for it is necessary to bye propre oil for every lamp.

For asmoche tha^ as or adversaries do teach to put trust in the invocation
of saints, when they have neither the word of god, neither example of the
scripture / sith also they apply the merits of saints for other men, none
otherwise than the merits of Christ, and do shyft the honor due to Christ
unto the saints: we can neither receive the opinions of them, concerning the
worshyppyng of saints, neither their custom of invocation. For we know, that
we must put our trust in the solicitation or intercession of Christ. For to
this only is given the promise of god. We know that only Christis merits is
a mercystocke for us, and for Christ's merits we be compted ryghtuous, wha^ we
believe in him, as the text says, All that trust in him, shall not be
ashamed. Neither be we justified by trust of the merits of the blessed virgin,
or of other saints.

Erroneous persuatio^s
Here also stycketh an error among learned men, that to every saint is
committed his propre busynes or office, as that saint Anne should give riches
/ saint Sebastiane should keep away the pestilence / saint Ualentine should
remedy the falli^g sickness / saint George should defend knights and horsemen.
These persuations undoubtedly have risen out of the examples of pagans and
hethen people. For so among the Romans, The (...) Rom^^^
Juno was thought to make rich / the goddess Febris to drive away the ague /
Castor and Pollux to defend horsemen. And let us put the case, that invocation
of saints were taught as measurably as might be, yet sithe thexample is very
perylous, what need they defend it, when there is neither commandment or
testimony of the word for it? No neither yet any testimony of the old
writers. First because (as I said before) when other mediators be sought
^esydes Christ, trust is put in other, the hole knowledge of Christ is
overthrown* and that the thing it self shows. Mention of saints such as
be in the old collectes and prayers at the beginning as it seems were
received for a tolerable purpose. Afterward followed invocation, After
invocation followed prodigious and more than hethen abuses, from invocation they
came to images, the images also were worshipped, and there was thought a
certain power to be in them, likewise as enchauntours do imagine certain
virtue and strength to be in the images of the.xij. signs, if they be graven
at certain times.

We saw in a certain monastery an image of the blessed virgin Marie, which
was moved proprely, as though it had moved by the own self, in such wise,
that it seemed with signs, either to deny petions, The lege^de of saints.
or else to grant petitio^s. And yet the fabulous histories of saints which
were read openly with great authority, do pass far the monstrous images
and pictures. Babara
Barbara in the mids of her torments as kethe a ^oone or a reward, that no
man, which prayed unto her, should dye with out housell. Another of them said
over the hole psalter daily, standing on the one foot. Some wise man painted a
Christofore, Christofore.
that is to say, a bearer of Christ, which would signify by an allegory,
that there had need to be great strength of mind in the^, which should bear
Christ, that is to say, which should teach the gospel, or confess and
acknowledge Christ, because that such one must needs abide great ieopardies.
Afterward folyshe freers taught among the people, to call and pray to
Christofore, as though there had been ones such a Polypheme (that is for to
say) such a great gyau^t in very deed. And where as saints in deed have
done very great things, either profitable to the common weal, or else
containing private examples, the rehersall whereof should be very profitable
both to establyshe the faith, and also to provoke other to follow their
acts: no man sought out these things out of the true histories. Undoubtedly
it is profitable to hear, how holy men did administre commonweals / what
chau^ces, what ieoperdies they put them selves in / how holy men did help
kings in great ieopardies / how they taught the gospel / what disputations
and batayles they had with heretics. The examples also of mercy be profitable,
Peter denied his master.
as when we see, that Peter was perdoned the denieng of his master / that
Cyprian was forgyuen / that he was a negromancer / when we se Augustine in his
syckenes prouinge the strength of faith, to afferme stedfastlye, that god
does in deed hear the prayers of them that do believe. Such manner examples,
which do conteyne either faith, or fear, or administration and governance of
the comen weal, it were profitable to be recited. But certain hypocrites or
stage players, not endued with any knowledge, either of faith or of gouernynge
of commonweals, have imagined tales, (countrefaytynge the works of poets) in
which be nothing else but only superstitious examples of certain prayers, of
certain fastes / and there be added also certain things making for lucre, As
for example, the feigned miracles of the Rosaries, and like ceremonies. Neither
is it need to rehearse hear any examples. For there be legendes (as they call
them) glasses of examples and Rosaries, in which there be many things not
unlike to the true narrations of Luciane, Lucian made a story in derisio^ of
other in which is not one true word.
in which is never a true word. These wonderful and wicked tales, bishops,
divines, religious men, do favor and allow, because they make for the belie.
But us they may not abide, which to thentent that the honor and benefit of
Christ might the more be seen. do not require invocation of saints, and do
rebuke the abuses in the honoring of saints. And notwithstanding that all
good men euerywhere do desire either the authority of the bishops, or the
diligence of the preachers, in the redressyng of these abuses: yet our
adversaries in the confutation do utterly dissemble, and will not be a known
even of those vices, which be manifest and open, as though, if the confutation
were received, they would compelle us to allow even the most known and
evident abuses. So disceytfully is the confutation made, not only in this
place, but almost euerywhere. There is no place, in which they do discern the
manifest abuses from their decrees and opinions. And yet among them selves, if
any be wyser than other, they do grant, that many false persuations do stycke
in the doctrine of schole men and canonistes, and besides this that many abuses
have cropen in to the church, through the great ignorance and negligence of
pastors and curates. For Luther was not the first, which complained of open
abuses. Many right conning and excellent men have long before these days
sorowed and bewailed the abuses of the mass / the trust in the obseruaunces
of monks and freers / the gaynfull worshyppynge of saints / the confuse
darkness of the doctrine of penance / which ought to be even most plain and
open of all other in the church. We our selves have herd excellent divines
say, that there wa^teth measure in the doctrine of scole men / wherein is
contained much more philosophical braullyng, than godlynes. And yet among
these, the old men be more nere to the scripture, than the writers of late
time. So the divinity of them has thus gone out of kind more and more.
Neither was there any other cause to many good men, which began to love
Luther at the beginning: then that they saw him to rydde and deliver the
minds of men from those endeles mases of most confuse and enuegeled
disputations / which be among the schole divines and canonistes, and to
teach things profitable to true virtuous living. Wherefore our adversaries
did very maliciouslye, that when they would have us agree to the confutation:
they did dissemble and speak no word of the abuses. And if they would the
welthe and profit of the Church: they ought specially in this place, in this
occasion, to exhort the Emperors majesty, that he would take counsel
concerning the redress of these abuses, whom we perceived very evidently to be
most desirous of well ordering and healynge of the church. But our
adversaries go not about to help and further the most honest and holy
entente and purpose of themperoure: but that they may oppress us by all manner
means. Many euidente tokens show, that for the church they take little
thought. They give no diligence, that the people may have among them some
certain form of decrees and opinions in the church. Manifest abuses they
defend with a new and strange cruelty. They suffer no worthy teachers in
the church. What they entende by these things good men may easelye judge.
But by this way they neither provide well for their own kingdom, neither yet
for the church. For wha^ the good teachers be burned and slain, and the true
doctrine is oppressed: afterward there shall rise mad and frantike persons,
whom our adversaries shall not be able to repress, which shall trouble the
church with wicked opinions, and shall overthrow the hole order of the
Church, which we desire very greatly to conserve and keep. Wherefore we
beseech and pray you, most noble emperor Charles, for the glory of Christ,
which we do not doubt but your majesty desires to garnyshe, set forth, and
increase: that ye will not assente to the violente counsayles of our
adversaries, but that ye will seek other honest ways of making concord and
peace, in such wise, that godly consciences be not ouercharged, ne any
cruelty be exercised upon innocent men, so as we have seen used yet hitherto,
nor the wholesome and true doctrine in the church be oppressed. This service ye
most specially owe unto god, to conserve, I mean, the right and wholesome
doctrine, and to provide, that it may come to them, which shall follow after
your time, and to defend them that teach the right and true doctrine. For
this thing god requires, when he garnyshethe kings with his own name, and
callethe them gods, saying, I said ye be gods, that is to say, kings be
ordained to provide, that godly things, that is to wit, the gospel of
Christ be maynteyned, and spredde abroad, and that as being gods deputies,
they should defend the life and health of innocent persons.

Of both kinds to be given in the souper of the lord.
IT can not be doubted, but that it is an holy thing, and agreing to the
institution of Christ, and to the words of Paul, to use both parts or
kinds in the souper of the lord. For Christ did institute both parts / and
he did institute the^ not for part of the church, but for the hole church.
For not only prestes, but the hole church uses the sacrament, and that by
the authority of Christ, and not by the authority of man. And these we think
that our adversaries do grant. Now if Christ did institute this sacrament for
the hole church: why is the one kind taken away from part of the church?
why is the use of the one kind forbidden? why is the ordenaunce of Christ
changed? namely sithe he himself does call it his testamente. That if it be
not lauful to break the testament and last will of a man: much less it
shall be laufull to break the testamente of Christ. And Paul says that he
received of the lord, 1. Co. 11
that which he taught. But he taught the use of both kinds as the text
evidently shows. Do this (says he) first speaking of the body / afterward
he repeteth the same words of the cup. And after he says, let a man try and
examyne himself, and so let him eat of the bread, and drink of the cup.
1. Co. 11
These be the words of one disposing and ordering. And he speaks before,
that they which should use the souper of the lord, should use it together in
one company. Wherefore it is evident, that the sacrament was instituted for the
hole church. And the use there of remains yet in some churches of the Greeks.
And the same custom was sometime also in the latin churches, as Cypriane and
Hierome do witness. The words of saint Hierom
For thus says Hierome upon the prophet Sophonie. Sacerdotes qui
^ucharistiae seruiunt and sanguinem domini populis diuidunt. etc. The prestes,
which do serve the sacrament^ of the alter, which do divide the blood of the
lord to the people. etc. The council of Toletane witnesses the same. Neither
shall it be any great mastry to gather a great heap of testimonies. Here we
will not exaggerate ne amplify this thing we only leave it to the wise reader
to be considered, what is to be thought of the ordenau^ce of god. Our
adversaries in the co^futatio^ do not go about to excuse the church, from whom
the one part of the sacrament was taken away* It became good and religious men
to do these. They ought to have sought a sure and strong reason, to excuse the
church / and to teach the consciences, which can not be suffered to have but
one part of y^ sacrament. Now they defend, that it is well done to keep
away the one part, and they forbid to grant the use of both parts.
First they feign that in the church the manner was in some places, to give but
the one part alone. And yet can they bring forth none ancient example hereof
/ but they allege the places, in which mention is made of bread / as in
Luke. Where it is written, that the disciples knew Christ by breaking of the
bread. They allege also other places of breakyng of the bread. And albeit we
do not greatly say against them, but that some of those places may be
understood of the sacrament: yet for all that this does not follow, that
there was given but the one part alone, for by namyng of part the residue is
betokened, by a comen manner and custom of speaking. They add also of the
laicall communion / which was not the use of y^ one kind alone, but of both.
And if at any time prestes be bydde^ to use the laicall communion, it is mente,
that they were removed from the ministry of consecration. And this thing our
adversaries do know well enough, but they do abuse the ignorance of unlearned
men / which, when they here speak of laicall communion: by and by do dream
of the manner and usage of our time, in which to lay men is given but only one
part of the sacrament. And se how shameless they be, Gabriel among other
causes recites, Gabriel
why both parts be not given: because there was a difference to be made
between lay men and prestes. And it is lykely enough, that this is the chief
cause, why the prohibitio^ of the one part is so greatly defended, that the
dignity of the order by this religious fashyon might be the better esteemed and
the more set by. These is an human reason and purpose (I will not speak over
sharply) which for what end it serves, it may easly be judged. And in the
confutation they allege of the sons of Helie, that when the office of the
high priest was lost they should desire but one part sacerdotall / as it is
written in the first book of kings. 1. Re. 2.
Here they say is signified the use of one only kind. And they add this
conclusion. So therefore our lay men also ought to be content with one part
sacerdotal, that is to wete, with one kind. Uerely our adversaries do dallye
and tryfle, when they apply the hystory of the children of Helie to the
sacraments. There is described the punyshme^t of Helie, will they say this
also, that the lay men be kept from the one part because of punyshemente?
The sacrament was instituted to comfort and lift up troubled and feared
minds, when they believe, that the flesh of Christ, which was given for the
life of the world, is meat / and when they believe, that they joined to
Christ be quickened. But our adversaries do reason, that lay men be kept
from the one part because of punysheme^t. The lay men (say they) ought to be
co^tente. This is very imperiously spoken. And why ought they? There ought
not to be asked why, nor any cause is to be enquired: but what soever divines
say, it must be a law. This is the foul vometyng and dronkyn sayi^g of
Eccius. Eccius
For we espy these thrasonicall and proud bragging words of these fellows,
which if we were disposed to touch, so as we might do we should not lack
matter nor oration. For ye se how they be past shame. He commands (as it
were a tyraunte in tragedies) that whether they will, or not will, they ought
to be contented. Shall these reasons, which he alleges at domes day excuse
these men which do forbydde part of the sacrament, and which do thus rage
against good men that use the hole sacrament? If they do forbydde it for this
skille, that there should be a difference of the order: this self same reason
ought to move us, that we do not agree to our adversaries, even though we were
else minded to have observed the custom and manner with them. There be other
diversities betwixt the order of prestes, and the state of the people / but it
is easy to se, what is their entente / and why they do defend this diversity
or difference so greatly. But we, least we might seem to minishe the true
dignity of the order, will speak no more at this time of this their craftye
and subtyle purpose.

They allege also the peril and ieoperdie of spyllyng, and certain like
things / which have not so great strength, as to change the ordenaunce of
Christ. And let us put the case, that it were free either to use the one part
or both: How can yet the prohibition be defended? Howbeit the church does
not take this liberty unto her, that she may make of Christ's ordenau^ces
things indifferent. We verily do excuse the church, which has sustained this
injury and wrong, because they might not be suffered to have both parts: but
the auctours and causers, which do defend, that it is well done to prohibit
the use of the hole sacrament / and which not only do prohibit the use, but
also do excommunicate and persecute with violence them, that do use the hole
sacrament: these persons (I say) we can not excuse. Let the^ look to their
own charge, how they will make answer to god / and what cause they will
show of these their purposes and ententes. Neither is it to be judged
forthwith, that the church does ordeyne or approve what soever things the
bysshopes of Rome do ordeyne / namely sithe the scripture does prophecy of
bysshopes and curates that they should so do / as Ezechiel says. Peribit lex
a sacerdote. The law shall begin to peryshe at the priest.

Of the wedlock of priests.
Notwithstanding the great infamy which goes abroad of the filthy single
life of prestes: yet nevertheless or adversaries dare ^at only defend the
bishop of Romes law, under the wicked cloak and false pretense of the name of
god, but also they dare exhort the emperor and the princes, that in nowyse
they should suffer the wedlockes of prestes, to the great shame and infamy of
the Romayne empire, for so they speak. What more unshamefastness has ever ben
read in any hystorye, then is this of our adversaries? For the arguments,
which they use, we shall rehearse afterward. Now let the wise reader
considre what shame these vile wretches have, which say, that wedlock does
engendre shame and infamy to the empire / as who should say, that the church
is greatly garnyshed and renoumed by the open infamy of those ungracious and
prodigious kinds of lechery, which do brenne among these holy fathers,
which outwardly do cou^terfet and pretend the sadness and virtue of Curious,
but in corners live most viciously and voluptuously. Yea and a great part of
those things may not be so much as named with honesty, which these men
cease not to do with great boldness. And these their prodigious voluptuousnes
and lusts they desire to have defended with your most chaste right hand
(most noble Emperor) whom even certain old prophecies do call the king
with the chaste face. For it apperith very well that this was spoken of you,
pudicus facie regn^ bit ubique. The chaste in face shall raygne every where.
They desire, that contrary to the law of god, contrary to the law of all
nations, contrary to the canones of the councils, ye should pull in sundre and
break matrimonies, that ye should ordeyne grievous and sore punyshmentes
against innocente men for cause of wedlock, that ye should kill prestes, who^
even the Barbarianes do reverently and religiously spare / that ye should drive
women and fatherles children into exile as persons outlawed and banished. Such
sort of laws they offer unto you (most good and most chaste Caesar) which no
barbarous nation, beit never so cruel and beastly could find in their heart
to hear. But for asmoche, as in these your gracious manners, there can be no
filthynes or cruelty: we hope that ye will in this cause deal gentely with
us, namely after that ye shall know that we have most wayghtye causes for
the mayntenau^ce of our sentence and opinion taken out of the word of god /
against which our adversaries do set most tryfelynge and most vain
persuations. And yet they do not defend single life earnestely. For they
know, how few of them do keep chastity, but they cloak their kingdom with
a color and semblaunce of religion / to the which kingdom of theyrs, they do
reken single life to be very profitable. / so that now we may perceive that
Peter gave warning very well, that in time to come false prophets should
deceive men with feigned words. For our adversaries nothing say, nothing
write, nothing do in all this hole cause, truly, simply, plainly, and
charitablye, but in very deed they strive about their lordeshyp and
kyngedome, which they do falsely suppose to be in ieopardie, and this they go
about to fortify and maynteyne under the wicked pretense and color of virtue
and holiness. But we in no wise can approve this law of living single and
without wives, which our adversaries do so greatly defend, because it is
repugnaunte to the law of god, to the law of nature, and disagreinge from the
very canones of the councaylles. And undoubted it is also, that it is
superstitious and perylous. For it engenders infinite sclaunders, sins, and
corruptynge of the publyke manners. Other of our controversies do require some
disputation of learned men. In this matter the thing is so manifest on both
sides, that it needs no disputation at all: only it requires a judge, that
is a good man, and which fears god. And notwithstanding that we defend the
manifest verity: yet our adversaries have devised certain cauillations to
mock out our arguments.

The.1. reason.
First of all, the book of Genesis teaches, that men were created, that they
should be fruitful, and that the man should desire the company of the woman,
and contrarywyse, by right reason. For we speak not of concupiscence, which
is sin: but of that appetite, which should have been in nature uncorrupted,
which they call natural appetite. And this appetite is verily gods
ordenaunce of the one kind or sex to the other. Now sithe this ordenau^ce of
god can not be taken away without the si^guler and special work of god: it
folowethe, that the law of contractynge of matrimony can not be taken away
with statutes or vows. A cauillation.
Our adversaries do make here a cauillation and say, that at the beginning of
the world it was commanded, that the earth should be filled / but now the
earth being full, they say that wedlock is not commanded. Se how wisely
they judge The nature of man is formed and created thrughe that word of god,
that it should be fruitful, not only in the beginning of creation, but so
long as this nature of the bodies shall be, even likewise as the earth is made
fruteful by virtue of these word Germinet terra herbam uirentem. Gene. 1
Let the earth bring forth grene grass. By these ordenaunce of god, the earth
began not only at the beginning to bring forth grass, but yerelye the feldes
be covered and vestured with grass* and shall be whiles the world and this
nature of things shall continue and endure. Therefore likewise as by the laws
of man the nature of the earth can not be changed: even so neither by vows,
neither by any laws, may the nature of man be changed, without the special
work of god.

The.2. reason.
Secu^darily, because this creation or ordinance of god in man, is the law of
nature: therefore the men of law have said very well and wyselye, that the
coupelynge of man and woman together is of the law of nature. Now sithe the
law of nature is immutable and can not be changed: it follows necessarilye,
that the power and liberty to contracte matrimony does always remain and
abide. For when nature is not changed, that ordenaunce also must needs
remain, which god gave unto nature, neither can it be taken away by any
man's laws. That therefore is but a folyshe saying, which our adversaries
after their tryfelynge manner do say, that wedlock was commanded at the
beginning, but it is not commanded now. This is even like wise as if they
should say, In old time men, wha^ they were borne, brought with them in to the
world the natural appetite and their sex or kind, but now they do not so.
In old time wha^ they were borne, they brought with them the law of nature,
now they do not so. No workman could ever desire or imagyne any thing more
craftelye, and like a crafts man, than these folyshe tryfles have been imagyned
to elude and avoid the law of nature. Let this thing therefore abide stable
and steadfast in this cause, which both the scripture teaches, and the man
of law has wisely spoken, tha^ the ioyni^ge together of man and woman is the
law of nature. But the law of nature is in deed the law of god. For it is an
ordenaunce imprinted by god in nature. And because this law can not be
changed without the special work of god: it is necessary and can not be
avoided, but that power and liberty to contracte matrimony must needs abide.
For that natural appetite is the ordenaunce of god in nature of one kind or
sex to an other, and therefore it is right and law, for else why should both
kinds be created? And we speak (as it was said before) not of concupiscence,
which is sin: but of that appetite, which they call natural love or
affection, which love concupiscence has not taken out of nature, but rather
does kendle it / so that now it has more need of remedy / and wedlock is
now necessary, not only because of procreation, but also because of remedy.
These things be clear and evident, and so sure and strong, that they can be
by no means avoided.

The.3. reason.
Thyrdely Paul says, For cause of fornication let every man have a wife of
his own. This is an express commandment belongyng to all men, which be not
mete to the single life. Our adversaries do bid, that we should show a
commandment unto them, which commands priests to wedde wives, as though
priests were no men. Certes we judge that those things, which we dispute in
general of the nature of man, do also apperteine to priests. Does not Paul
command here that those men should marie wives, which have not the gift of
co^tinence and chastity? For Paul declares his own self not long after,
when he says, It is better to marye, 1. cor. 7
than to burn. And Christ said plainly, Non omnes capiu^t uerbum hoc sed
quibus datum est.1. Mat 19
Al men do not take this saying, but they only to whom it is given. For now
after sin these two things go together, natural appetite, and
concupiscence, which inflameth natural appetite / so y^ now there is more
need of wedlock, than was when nature was perfect and incorrupted. Therefore
Paul speaks of wedlock, as of a remedy. And for to avoid those brennynges
and inflammations of the lust, he commands to mary. Neither can any
authority or any law of man* or any vows, take away this saying of Paul,
It is better to mary than to brennne. For these said things take not away
nature or concupiscence. Therefore who soever burn, have power and liberty to
mary. And they be bound by this commandment of Paul, that for to avoid
fornication every one should have a wife of his own, as many as do not truly
conteyne and live chaste / the judgment whereof apperteyneth to every man's
own conscience. For where our adversaries do bydde us here desire continence
of god, and do bid us also, to tame and mortify our body with labors and
abstinence / why do they not sing these high precepts to their own selves?
But as we said before our adversaries do naught else but tryfle / they do
nothing earnestlye. If continence or chastity were possible to all men: than
it should not require a special gift. But Christ shows that there is need
of a special gift: wherefore all men do not attain it. The residue, which
have not this gift, god wyllethe to use the common law of nature, which he
has ordained. For god is not content, that his ordenaunces, or his creatures
be despised. In such wise he wylleth them to be chaste, that yet they may use
the remedy, which god has ordained. Like wise as he will that we so maintain
our life, if we do use meat and drink. And Gerson witnessethe, y^ there have been many good men, which have endeavored them selves to tame their body, and
yet it has little auayled them. Therefore Ambrose says very well, Ambrose
Only virginity is the thing, which may be counsaylled, but can not be
commanded, it is a thing more of wysshe or desire tha^ of commandment. If
any man will obiecte here, An objection.
that Christ does praise them, which do gelde them selves for the kingdom of
heaven* let him also consider this, that he prayseth such manner men, which
have the gift of co^tinence. And therefore he added, Qui potest capere capiat.
He that may take, let him take. Mat 19
For unclean and fylthy continence does not please Christ. we also do praise
true continence. But we do now dispute of the law, and of them, which have
not the gift of continency. The thing ought to be left free, there ought no
bonds or snares to be cast upon the weyke persons by this law.

The.4. reason.
Fourthly the law of the bishop of Rome disagreeth also from the canones of the
councels. For the old canones do not prohibit wedlock, neither do they
break or depart wedlock alredye contracted, Albeit they do remove them from
ministration, which have made contracte in the time that they were in
ministry. And this remouyng of them from administration was at those times in
stead of a benefit. But the new canones, which were not made in the
counsels, but by the private will of popes: both do prohibit to co^tracte
matrimony, and also do dissolve and break those, which were alredye
contracted. And this appears evidently to be contrary to the commandment of
Christ, which says: Whom god has joined let no man depart in sondre. Our
adversaries cry out in the confutation, Mat 19
that to live single without wives is commanded by the councelles. We do not
accuse the the decrees of the councelles. For these decrees under a certain
condition do permit wedlock / but we do accuse the laws, which the
bishops of Rome have made syns the old general councils, contrary to the
authority of the said councelles. Thus do th^e bishops of Rome despise the
auctorities of the councils, which they will that other men should think to
be most holy and inviolable. This law therefore of perpetual absteynyng from
marriage is only the law of this new domination of the pope. And that not
without a cause. For Daniel gyuethe this mark and token to the kyngedome of
Antichriste, that they shall contemn women.

The.5. reason.
Fyftelye, although our adversaries do not defend the law because of
superstition, forasmoche as they se that it is not wont to be observed: yet
nevertheless they sow superstitious opinions, whiles they pretend religion and
holiness. They say that they require the single life, and absteynyng from
marriage, because it is purity and clennes, as who should say, that marriage
were uncleanness and sin. or as though single life did merit remission of
sins, and reconciliation / and wedlock did not so. And to this purpose they
allege the ceremonies of Moses law / that sith in the law, during the time
of their ministration, the priests were separated from their wives: much more
in the new testament the preeste forasmoche as he ought always to pray,
ought always to contain and live chaste. This folyshe and unmeet similitude is
alleged as it were a demonstration and a most strong and evident proffe, that
priests ought never to mary. And yet in the similitude it self, wedlock is
permitted and granted: only the use of the wife is forbidden, during the
time of their ministry. And they be two sundry things, to pray and to
ministre. The holy men did pray even than also, when they did not exercise any
public or open ministry or office. Neither did the companyenge with their
wives let them that they might not pray. But we will answer in order to
these feigned tryfles and figmentes. First our adversaries must needs grant
this, that wedlock is pure and clean in them, that do believe / because it is
sanctified with the word of god, that is to say, it is a thing laufull and
approved by the word of god, as the scripture copiously does record. For
Christ calls wedlock gods ioynyng or couplyng together. when he says,
Mat 19
whom god has joined together. And Paul says of wedlock, of meats and like
things, They be sanctified by word and prayer, that is, by the word, wherewith
the conscience is made sure and out of doubt, that god does approve and allow
it, and by prayer, that is for to say, by faith, which uses it with gyuyng
of thanks, as the gift of god. Also in the first epistle to the Corinthianes
he says: 1. cor. 7
The unchristian husband is sanctified by the christen wife, etc. that is to
say, the use and companyeng of them together is laufull and holy, because of
the faith in Christ, as it is laufull to use meat and drink. etc. Also to
Timothe he writes, 1. Ti. 2.
The woman is saved by generation, and by bryngyng forth of children. etc. If
our adversaries could bring forth such a place of scripture for single
life: tha^ would they make merueylous triumphs. Paul says that the woman is
saved by generation and bringing forth of children. What could be said more
honorable against the hypocrisy of single life, than that a woman is saved by
works of matrimony by use and company coniugale of the one with the other,
by bringing forth children, and by other works apperteinyng to the orderyng
of an house? And what is Paul's mind? Let the reder observe and mark faith
to be added, and not the offices or works of ordering an house to be praised
without faith, if they abide (says Paul) in the faith. For he speaks
generallye of the holle kind of mothers. Therefore he does principallye
require faith, by which the woman receives remission of sins and
justification. Afterward he adds a certain work of calling, Likewise as in
every man there ought to follow after faith the good work of a certain
vocation. This work pleases god because of faith. So the works of the woman
please god because of faith / and the christen woman is saved, which in such
sort of works of her calling does godly seruise. These auctorities and
testimonies do teach, that wedlock is a lauful thing. If tha^ this word
(cle^nes) betoken that thing, which is laufull and approved before god: than
be wedlockes clean because they be approved by the word of god. And Paul
says of laufull things, Omnia munda mundis. i. All things be clean to them
that he clean, that is to say, to them, which believe Christ, and be
ryghtuous by faith. Therefore as virginity in wicked men is unclean: so
wedlock in godly men is clean, because of the word of god and faith. But
if this word cle^nes be taken as a thing contrary to concupiscence: so
wedlock betokens clennes of heart, that is for to say, a mortified
concupiscence, because the law does not forbid wedlock, but concupiscence,
adultery, fornication, wherefore single life is not clennes. For there may be
more clennes of the heart in a married man, as in Abraham, or Jacob, than in
very many of those, yea which be truly continente. Finally, if in such sort
they understand single life to be cle^nes. because it does merit
justification, more then ^edlocke: we than plainly with open voice say against
them. For we be justified neither for cause of virginity, neither for cause of
wedlock, but freelye for Christis sake, when ^e believe that for his sake we
have god good and gracious to us.

Here peradventure our adversaries shall cry out, that after ye manner of
Iouiniane wedlock is of us made egall to virginity. But we will not for these
rebukes and reuiling words cast away the truth of the ryghtousnes of faith,
which we have before declared. And yet we do not make virginity egall to
matrimonye. For likewise as one gift is better then another, as prophecy is
better then eloquence / eloquence is better then carpenters craft: so
virginity is a more excellent gift then wedlock. And yet as an Orator is
not more rightuous before god for cause of hes eloquence then a carpenter
because of his carpentrie: so likewise a virgin meriteth no more justification
with her virginity, then a wife does with the works apperteinyng to a wife /
but every one in their gift ought to serve faythefully* and to think that by
fathe for Christ's sake they obtain remission of si^nes, and by faith be
reputed ryghtuous before god. And neither Christ nor Paul do praise
virginity therefore, because it does justify: but because it is less combred
and has fewer cares belonging to it / and is less let with domestical
occupations and busynesses, in prayeng, in teaching, in doing service to god.
Therefore says Paul. 1. cor. 7
The virgin carith for those things, which be the lords. Uirginitie then is
praised for the exercise and study. So Christ does not absolutely and
generally praise all them, which do gelde them selves: but he addethe, for the
kingdom of heaven, that is for to say, that they may have leisure to learn or
to teach the gospel. For he does not say that virginity does merit
remission of sins or salvation. To the examples of the leuitical prestes we
have answered, that they prove not, that prestes ought to be bound to
abstain from marriage all their life time / again the leuitical vncle^nesses
ought not to be applied to us. A custom against the law, was then uncleanness.
Now such custom is not uncleanness / for Paul says, All things be clean
to them that be clean. For the gospel delivers us and makes us free from
these leuitical impurities. And if any man does defend the law of abstaynyng
from marriage, to the end to charge and lade consciences with those leuiticall
obseruaunces: Act. 15.
that man ought to be resisted in likewise as the apostles did resyste them
which required circumcision / and which went about to lay the burdon of
Moses law upon christian me^nes necks. In the mean season yet good men know
how to moderate the carnal use and company of their wives, namely when they
be busyed with publycke ministeries and offices apperteynynge to the comen
weal / with which good men be often times so busied and troubled, that they
do cast the thoughts and cares concerning their house out of their minds.
Good men know this also that Paul does bydde us to possess our vessels in
sa^ctification. They know also, that sometime they ought to go a sondre / to
the entente yt they may the better give their mind to prayer / but Paul will
not, 1. cor. 7
that they should keep in sondre continually. Now such manner continency is
easy to them, that be good men and occupied. But that great multitude of idle
prestes, which be in Collegies, can not fulfill so much as this leuiticall
continency (they live in so great welthe and pleasures) as experience shows
daily. And these verses of the Poet be known well enough. Desidiam puer ille
sequi solet, odit agentes (that is to say) That lust and desire of bodyly
pleasure is wont to follow slouthfulnes but it hates those that he busy and
doing. Many heretics through the mysunderstandynge of the foresaid law of
Moses, have had contumelious and shameful opinions of wedlock. And such
were the Encratites, of whom we have spoken before. And it is undoubted and
evidently known, that monks and freers have been wont to sow and sprede
abroad euerywhere many superstitious sentences concerning single life / which
sentences have troubled many godly consciences, even because of the laufull use
of matrimony. And it should be no hard thing for us to rehearse and tell
examples. For albeit they did not utterly condemn matrimony, because of
procreation: yet they did dysprayse it, as a kind of lyui^g, which scarcely
at any time does please god or at the least wise should not please god but
only because of procreation. But single life they did extolle and magnify as
an angelical kind of living. This they preached to be the most pleasant
sacrifice unto god, to merit remission of sins / to merit garlondes or
crowns / to bring forth the hundredth fold fruit and other things out of
nombre. These religions of aungelles Paul does greatly improve writing to
the Collossians. For they do oppress the knoweledge of Christ, when men do
think, that they be reputed ryghtuous for such manner obseruaunces, and not
for Christ's sake / they oppress also the knowledge of the co^mauddementes of
god, when besides the precepts of god new ceremonies and services be devised,
and preferred before the commandments of god. Wherefore these superstitious
opinions, concerning single life, be diligently to be resisted, to thentent
that both godly consciences may know what manner honors and service god
does approve. But in deed our adversaries do not require single life through
any superstition. For they know that chastity is not wont to be kept. But
they cloak their busynes with superstitious opinions, to the intent that they
may begyle the simple and unlearned persons. They be therefore more worthy of
hatered than the Encratites, which seem to have fallen in to error thrughe a
certain apparaunce of holiness. But these voluptuous fellows do purposely abuse
the pretense of religion.

The.6. reason.
Sixtely, though we have so many causes of disprouynge the law of perpetual
abstinence from marriage: yet besides these causes there be many ieopardies of
souls and open s^launders and occasions of hurt, which, although the law
were not unrighteous, yet it ought to fear away good men from the approuynge
of such manner of burden, which has destroyed innumerable souls. All good
men have complained long of this burden, as well for their own cause, as for
other men's cause, whom they did se to be in ieoperdie. But these complaints
no bishops do hear. And it is not unknown, how greatelye this law does
hurt the comen and publyke manners, what vices, what ungracious kinds of
lecherye it has engendered and brought up. There be yet remayni^g the Romayn
satyrs. In these satyrs, Rome even these days also does know and epsy her
manners touched. Thus god auengeth and ponysheth the contempt and despisinge of
his gift, and of his ordenaunce in those persons, which forbid wedlock. And
sithe in other laws the custom has been to change them, if euidente utility
have so required: why do they not the same in this law, in which there be so
many weyghtye causes rennynge together (namely these last days) why it ought
to be changed? Nature waxes old and is made daily weyker and weyker, and
vices do increase / wherefore the remedies taught and given by god were the
more to be used. We see what vice god does accuse before the floode / what
vice he does accuse before the brennyng of the five Cities / Like vices have
gone before the destructions of many other cities, as of Sybaris / of Rome. And
in these is set forth an image or similitude of the times, which shall be
next to the worlds end. Therefore principally at this time they ought to
strengthen and to fortify wedlock with most sharp laws and ensamples, and
to provoke men to we^lock. This apperteyneth to the head officers and rulers,
which ought to maynteyne good order in a comen ^eale. In the mean season,
the preachers and teachers of the gospel, let them do both two things, I
mean, let them exhort those that be vnco^tine^t to wedlock / and again let
them exhort other, that they do not despise the gift of continence. The
bishops of Rome do daily dispense, do daily change other laws, yea although
alredye they be very good: but in this one law of absteinyng from marriage,
they he as hard herted as iron, and will not be entreated, albeit every man
knowethe, that it is only man's law. And this self same law they do now
aggrauate and make more streyte many ways. The can on law byddeth to suspende
priests, the bishops being cruel interpreters of the law, do suspende them
not from their office, but they hang them up by the necks upon trees. They
kylle many good men cruellye, only because of marriage. And these self
murders do show and declare, that this law is a doctrine of deuylles. For the
devil, for asmoche as he is a manqueller, defends his laws with such
murders. We know that there be some offended by the occasion that we seem ^o
be divided from them, which be esteemed to be the ordinary bishops / but our
consciences is safe and out of ieoperdie. For as much as we know, that
although we desire with all labor and diligence to make concord, yet we can
in no wise pacify our adversaries, onles we would cast away the manifest truth
/ and also oneles we would conspire with them to defend this unrighteous law /
to dissolve and break matrimonies / to slay priests, if any refuse to obey /
to drive selye poor women and fatherles children in to exile, as persons
banyshed. But for asmoche as it is undoubted, that these conditions and laws
of peace do displease god: let us be sorry never a deal though we have not
fellowship, nor be parteners with or adversaries of so many murders. We have
declared the causes, why we can not with good conscience agree unto our
adversaries, which defend the popes law made concerning perpetual
absteynynge from marriage, that is to wit, because it is repugnante and
contrary to gods law, to the law of nature, and disagreeth also from the
canones, and besides this is superstitious and full of ieoperdie. Finally,
because all the hole matter is but feigned, and hypocritical. For this law is
not commanded because of any virtue or holiness, but because of lordshyp and
domination. And this they wyckedlye cloak and shadow under the pretense of
gods honor. Neither can there be any thing brought of any wise man against
these strong reasons. The gospel gives to them which have need, license and
liberty for to marye. And yet it does not compelle those to marye, which be
willing and disposed to conteyne, so that they conteyne and live chaste in
very deed. This liberty we think ought to be granted unto priests also /
neither will we compel any m^n by violence to keep him self unmarried /
neither yet dissolve ne break the maryages, which be alredye made. We have
also incidently, The arguments of the adversaries.
whiles we rehearsed our own arguments, showed and declared, how our
adversaries do dally awey and elude one or two of the arguments with
cauyllations, which cauillations we have wyped away and avoided. Now we shall
briefly rehearse with how strong reasons they defend this law. The.1.
argument.
First they say, that it came from god by revelation. Ye se thextreame boldenes
of these lewd fellows. They be not affrayde to afferme that the law of
perpetual absteinyng from marriage was showed from god by revelation, wha^ it
is contrary to the manifest testimonies of the scripture / 1. cor. 7
which do bid that every man should have his own wife, for than oydynge of
fornication / Mat 19
which also do forbid to dissolve or break matrimonies y^ be contracted. 1.
Timothe. 4.
Paul shewethe what auctour and maker this law should have, wha^ he calls it
the doctrine of deuylles. And the fruits also declare who is the auctor / so
many monstrous kinds of bodily lust / so many murders / which now be
received under the couerte and clooke of y^ law.

The.2. argument.
The second argument of our adversaries is, that priests ought to be clean,
according to that text of scripture, Mundamini qui fertis uasa domini, Esaie.
that is to say, Be ye made clean, which do bear the vessels of the lord.
And they allege many other things according to the same purpose. This reason,
of which they brag, as most apparaunte and glorious of al other, we have
avoided here before. For we have said, that virginity without faith is no
cle^nes in the sight of god. And on the other side, that wedlock by reason of
faith is clean, according to that text, Tit. 1.
Omnia mund^ mundis. All things be clean to them that be clean. We have
said this also, that the outward clennesses and ceremonies of the law be not
to be translated and applied to this ausines. For the gospel requires cle^nes
of the heart, it does not require the ceremonies of the law. And it may be
so, that the heart of a married man, as of Abraham, or of Jacob, which had many
wives, is more clean, and does less brenne with wanton lusts, than the
hertes of many virgins, yea which do live chaste in very deed. And as
touching to that which Esaie says, Se that ye be made clean, Esaie.
which do bear the vessels of the lord. This saying ought to be understood
of clennes of heart, and of hole repentance. But holy men as touchi^g the
outward use shall know well enough how farforth it shall be expedient to
measure the use of wedlock / and (as Paul says) to possess their vessels in
sanctification. Finally, sithe it is so that wedlock is clean, it were well
said to them, which in single life live not chaste, to bydde them marye
wives, that they may be clean. So the self same law, Se that ye be made
clean, which bear the vessels of the lord, does commau^de, that unclean
single men should be made clean and pure married men.

The.3. argument.
The third argument is horrible and fearful, that is to say, that it is the
heresy of Iouinian, that priests should have wives. God forbid, this is a
new accusation, that wedlock is heresy. In the time of Iouinian the world
knew not yet this law of perpetual absteynyng from matrimony: it is
therefore a shameful lie to say, that the wedlock of priests is the heresy
of Iouinian: or that than the wedlock of priests was condemned by the
church. In such manner places as this, a man may see, what purpose and entente
our adversaries had in writing the confutation. They judged that the simple and
unlearned men be so very sone moved and styrred, if they hear of the foul
reproach of heresy / if they do imagine that our cause has been confuted and
condemned in times passed, by many judgments of the church. Therefore they
do often times falsely allege the judgment of the church. And because they
know this well enough, they would not exhibete unto us a copy of the
confutation, lest this vanity, lest these false lies might be reproved. And
as touchi^g the cause of Iouinian, of the comparison of virginity and
wedlock, we have said our mind heretofore, what we think. For we do not
make wedlock and virginity egall and peers, albeit neither virginity,
neither wedlock does merit justification. With such manner arguments and so
vain they defend this law of perpetual absteynynge from matrimony, which
law is both wicked and also hurtful to good manners. With such manner reasons
they arm the minds of princes against the judgment of god / in which god
shall ask accomptes of them, why they have dissolved and undone so many
matrimonies / why they have tormented / why they have slain so many priests.
For doubt ye not, but as the blood of Abell, after that he was dead, did
cry unto god: so does also now the blood of many good men, upon whom cruelty
has been unjustly exercised. cry vengeance. And undoubtedly god shall
punyshe and revenge this cruelty. Than ye shall ^ynde how vain these reasons
of our adversaries be, and ye shall perceive that in the iu^gem^^t of god no
false cauillations be a^le to stand against the word of god, as Esaie says.
All flesh is hay, and all the glory of it is as it were the flower of the
grass. Our princes, what soever shall happen, may conforte them selves with
the clear conscience of their right purposes and ententes. For albeit the
priests had done any evil in contractyng ma^rimonie: yet that diuorcinge and
departing in sondre of matrimonies, those exiles and outlaries* that cruelty
to manifestly against the will and word of god. Neither do our pr^^ces delight
in newnes or dessension: but the word of god was rather to be regarded ((...)
in so plain and vndoubteful a cause) then all other things.

Of the Mass.
THis protestation we must make here again in y^ beginning that we do not
abrogate nor take away the mass, but we do religiously and reverently reteyne,
and defend it. For there be masses done among us every sunday, and other holy
days. At which Masses the sacrament is ministered to them that desy^e to
receive it, after that they have been examined and have received absolution. And
the publyke usual ceremonies be observed still with us, as the order of the
lessons, of the prayers, the apparayle, and other like things. Our
adversaries make a long declamation concerning the use of the latin tongue in
the mass / in which declamation full pleasauntly they do play the fools,
disputynge how it does profit the unlearned hearer in the faith of the
church, to hear the mass, which he understands not. For they feign, that
the very work of hearing is an honor and service to god, and also is
auayllable without any understanding. These matters we will not odiouslye
debate ne discuss, but we leave them to the judgment of the reders. And we do
therefore here recite them, to give men knowledge by the way, that the latin
lessons and oriso^s be retained and used still among us. But for asmoche as
ceremonies ought to be observed partly to thentent that men should learn the
scripture, and partelye that men being put in remembrance by the word should
conceive and gather faith, and fear, and so should pray also (for these be
thendes of ceremonies) we keep still the latin tongue for them, which do learn
and understand latin. And we mengle and join thereunto some songs in the
douche tongue, to thentent that the people also might have somewhat to learn,
and wherewith to sty^re up faith and fear. This has been the manner and custom
always in the churches and co^gregations. For albeit some congregatio^s have
added songs in the douche tongue more often, and other some more seldom: yet
well nere in every place the people song somewhat in their own natyue langage.
But this was never written ne painted in any place, that the work of hearing
the lessons, which they understand not, is auayllable to men / and that
ceremonies be profitable, not because they teach or put us in remembrance,
but by the virtue of the work that is wrought, because they be so or so done /
and because they be looked upon. Let all such pharisaical opinions go to the
myschiefe. And though there is done with us, only one comen mass: yet do we
nothing against the catholyke church. The usage of the greek churches.
For in the parysshes throughout Grecelande, there be not any private masses
done, not even in these days, but there is one comen mass done, and that only
on the sondayes and holy days. In monasteries there is a mass done daily /
but it is only a comen mass. These be the steps and leauynges of the old
customs. For none of all the old writers before Gregory makes mention of
private masses. In what manner they came up at the beginning, we now let
pass. But this is undoubtedly known, Freers.
that syns the beggynge freers began to rain, through most false persuations,
and for love of lucre, they have been so increased, that all good men have a
long season thought that the thing far excedethe measure. How be it saint
Frauncis intended full well to provide for this thing, The ordinance of saint
Frau^ces
which did constitute and ordeyne, that every monastery should be content with
one comen mass daily. This afterward was changed either through
superstition, or else because of lucre. Thus wha^ they se their time, them
selfs do change the ordenaunces of their forefathers, and afterward do
allege unto us the authority of the forefathers. Epiphanius. In Asia y^ mass
was done but th^yse a week.
Epiphanius writes, that in Asia thryse every weke they did consecrate, and
that there were no daily masses. And he says, that the apostles taught this
manner and custom* whose words written in the greek tongue be thus much to
say in english. Consecratio^s were ordained of the apostles, to be done the
wenesday, frydaye, and sunday. Now albeit our adversaries in this place do
heap many things together, to prove that the mass is a sacrifice: yet
nevertheless that great cry of words shall cease and be put to silence, if
only this one answer be made / that all that grea^e and long heap of
auctorities, of reasons, of testimonies, does not prove that the mass does
give grace by virtue of the work wroughte, or that the mass being applied for
others, does merit to them remission of venial and deadely sins, of the
crime, and of the pain. This one answer overthrows all things what soever
our adversaries do obiecte not only in this confutation, but also in all the
works, which they have made concerning the mass. And this is the state, the
standing, and principal point of this matter or cause, whereof the reders are
so to be admonyshed of us, Eschines.
as Eschines monyshed the judges, that like as wrestelers or champions do
strive about their stondynge among them selves: so they should strive with
their adversary of y^ state of the controversy, and suffer him not to straye
out of the matter or cause. After the same manner our adversaries must be
compelled to speak of the matier purposed / and when the very point, and
state of the co^trouersy is known: it shall be no mastry to judge betwixt the
arguments of both sides. For we in our confession have showed that our
opinion is, that the souper of the lord does not co^ferre ne give grace by the
virtue of the work that is wrought / neither when it is applied for other men
either quick or dead does deserve forgyuenes of sins / neither a culpa (as
they say) neither yet a pena. And the clear and strong probation of this
state is this, because it is impossible to obtain remission of si^nes for our
own work by the virtue of the work wrought / but by faith must the terrors
of sin and of death be ouercomen, when we comfort our hearts with the
knowledge of Christ, and think* that we be forgyuen for Christ's sake, and
that the merits and justice of Christ be given unto us as Paul to the
Romans says. To. 5.
Iustificati ex fide pacem habemus. that is to say. Being justified by says
we have peace* These things be so undoubted, and so strong and sure, that
they be able to stand against all the gates of hell. If we ought to have said
as much as need is: tha^ is our cause already at an end. For no man onles he be
mad can allow that pharisaicall and hethen parsuasion of the work wrought.
And yet this persuasion contynueth and stycketh fast among the people / and
this persuasion has increased masses, to infinite nombre. For masses be hired
to appease the wrath of god, and by this work they will obtain remission a
culpa et pena / they will obtain whatsoever they need in all this life. They
will also deliver dead men. This pharisaicall opinion have freers and
sophisters taught in the church.

Albeit we have sufficiently declared our cause already, yet that natwista^dyng
because our adversaries do wreste many scriptures folyshely to the defense of
their errors, we shall add a few things to this place. They have spoken many
things of sacrifice in the confutation, where as we in our confession
purposely did eschew that name because of ambiguitie / and doubtful taking of
the word. We have declared the thing what these men do mean now by
sacrifice, whose abuses we do repreue and speak against. But now to the
intent we may declare the scriptures wrongfully wrested, it is necessary first
at the beginning to expoune what sacrifice is. All these hole ten years our
adversaries have made almost infinite volumes of sacrifice. And yet has none
of them all hitherto put the diffinition of sacrifice. All only they take the
name of sacrifice either out of the scriptures, ^rels out of the works of the
fathers. That done they put dreams of their own ymagination as though
sacrifice did betoke^, whatsoever pleases them.

What is sacrifice, and which be the kinds of sacrifice.
Socrates.
SOcrates in the work of Plato entitled Phaedrus, says, that himself was
most desirous of distinctio^s or diuisio^s / because without them nothing can
be declared by speaking, ne yet by understanding. And if he found any man
connyng of dividing, him (he says) he waited upon, and followed his steps,
as though he were a god. And he byddeth him, that deuideth, to cut the
members and parts in the very joints, least he brouse and break any membre
after the fashyon of an evil coke. But these p^ceptes our adversaries do hyghly
despise, and in very deed (as Plato says) they be naughty cokes / corruptyng
the members of sacrifice / as it shall be perceived when we shall rehearse and
reckon up the kinds of sacrifice. The divines be wont, and that very well to
put a difference betwixt a sacrament and a sacrifice. Let therefore ceremony or
holy work be Genus (as the logiciane speaks y^ is to say the general term)
unto them both. A sacrament is a ceremony or an holy work, A sacrament what
it is.
in which god gives unto us that thing, which the promise annexed to the
ceremony does offer / as baptism is a work, not which we offer unto god, but
in which god does baptize us, that is to wete, the minister in the stead of
god / and here god offers and gives remission of si^nes. etc. according to
his promise Qui crediderit and baptizatus fuerit saluus erit, who soever shall
believe, and be baptized, shall be saved. mar. 16
On the other side a sacrifice is a ceremony or a work, which we give unto
god, A sacrifice what it is.
to honor and worship him with all. And there be two nerest kinds of
sacrifice* and there be no mo. The one kind is called sacrificium
propitiatorium / which ye may call in english a sacrifice of raunsom, that is
to say, Sacrificium propi^iatorium.
a work making satisfaction both for the offense, and the punyshement / that
is to say / reconciling god, or pacifieng the wrath of god, or which meriteth
to other men remission of sins. The other kind is sacrificium eucharisticon,
Sacrificium e^charisticon.
which in the english tongue a man may call a sacrifice of thanks gyuinge,
which deserves not forgyuenes of sins or reconciliation, but is done of
them, that be reconciled, to the intent to give thanks or to render thanks
for remission of sins and other benefits, which they have received of god.
These two kinds of sacrifice we must both in this controversy, and also in
many other disputations have always in sight and before our eyes / and we wust
with singular diligence take heed, that they be not confounded and mengled to
gether That if the quantity of this book would suffer it* we would add also
the reasons of this our division. For it has sufficient authorities and
testimonies in the epistle of Paul to the Hebrews, and in other places. And all the leuitical sacrificies may be reduced and brought to these members, as to
their own propre houses. For they were called in the law certain
propitiatory sacrifices / because of their signification or similitude* and
not because they did merit remission of sins before god / but because they
did merit remission of sins as touchi^g to the justice of the law, so that
they for whom such sacrifice were made, should not be excluded from this
polecie or comen weal And therefore Holocaustum pro p^ccato and Holocaustum pro
delicto, that is to say an hole brent sacrifice for sin and an hole brent
sacrifice for a fault or offense, these (I say) were called propiciatorie
sacrificies. But oblation, libation, retributio^s, first fruits, tenthes, al
these were called sacrifices Eucharistical, that is to say, sacrifices of
thanks gyuyng. But in very deed there was but only one sacrifice
propitiatory in the world, The death of Christ.
and that was the death of Christ / as the epistle to the Hebrews teaches
which says. Impossible est sanguine tau^orum et hircorum auferri peccata,
that is to say. It is impossible that sins should be taken away by the blood
of bulls and gotes. Heb. 10
And a little after he says of the will of Christ. Heb. 10
In which will we be santified, by the oblation of the body of Jesus Christ
ones for ever. And Esaie interpretith the law, to the intent that we should
know the death of Christ to be very satisfaction for our sins or
purgatio^, not the ceremonies of the law / and therefore he says. After that
he shall have given his life an host or sacrifice for sins: he shall se sede
or posterity of long contynuaunce. etc. For the hebrew word which Esaie
does use in this place, betokenith sacrifice for syn / which sacrifice i^ the
law did betoken that there was a certain host or sacrifice to come, which
should make satisfaction for our sins / and should reco^cile god / to the
end that men should know, that not for our own ryghtuousnes, but for the
merits of another, that is to wete of Jesus Christ, god is wyllyng to be
reconciled to us. Paul expounds the same hebrew word to signify or betoken
sin in the viii. chapitre to the Romans, saying, By sin he condemned
sin, that is to say, ^e punyshed sin by the host or sacrifice offered for
sin. Romans 8
The signification and strength of the word may be more easily perceived by
the manners of the gentiles, which we se to have been taken of the words of
the fathers not ryghtly understood. Latin men did call piaculu^, piaculu^
that host or sacrifice which was offered in great calamities, to pacify the
wrath of god, when god seemed to be excedingly angry / and sometime they made
sacrifice with man's blood, because peradventure they had her^e that the
sacrifienge of a man should in time cu^myng appease god to all mankind. The
Greeks have called them in some place Catharmata / and in some place
Peripsemata. Esaie therefore and Paul do understand, that Christ was made an
oblatio^ or sacrifice, such as latin men do call Piaculum / that by his
merits, and not by ours, god should be reconciled. Let this therefore remain
and abide in the cause, that only the death of Christ is the very true
propitiatory sacrifice. For those leuiticall propitiatory sacrifices were
called so only to signify the very propitiatory sacrifice that was to come.
And therefore by a certain similitude and lykenes they were satisfactions
redemynge the justice of the law, lest they which had offended should be
excluded from that comen weal. But these said sacrifices ought to cease after
that the gospel was ones reveled and brought to light. And because they ought
to cease at the time of the revelation of the gospel, they were not very
propitiations, sithe the gospel was therefore promised to give and show
propitiation. Now remain only Eucharistical sacrifices which be called
sacrifices of praise / preaching of the gospel / faith / invocation / thanks
gyuing / confession / the afflictions of holy me^ yea al good works of
saints. These sacrifices be not satisfactions for the doers of them or
satisfactions that may be applied for other folk, which may meritie unto them
remission of sins, or reconciliation by the virtue of the work wrought. For
they be done of them that be already reconciled. And such manner sacrifices be
the sacrifices of the new testamente / as Peter teaches in his first epistle
saying. To an holy presthod, 1. Pe. 2.
that ye should offer spiritual hoostes and sacrifices. How spiritual
sacrifices be set against, as contrary not only to the sacrificing of beasts,
but also to the works of men, which be offered because of the work wroughte.
For this word spiritual, betokenethe motions of the holy ghost in us. Paul
teaches the same, when he says: To. 12.
Offer your bodies as a quick sacrifice, holy, and a reasonable service. But
by reasonable service or honor is betokened that service, in which god is
understood, and perceived in the mind, as is done in the motions of fear
and of trust toward god. Therefore it is not only set against the leuiticall
honor or service, in which beasts were slain: but also that honor or
service, in which is feigned a work to be offered, by the virtue of the work
wrought. The same thing does the epistle to the Hebrews teach, which
says: Heb. 13.
By him let us offer sacrifice of praise always unto god / and he addethe the
interp^tation, that is to wit, the fruit of lyppes, co^fessyng his name. He
byddeth us offer praises, that is to say, invocation thanks gyuyng, confession
or knowlegyng of his name, and other semblable things. These things be of
strength, not by the virtue of the work wroughte, but by the means of
faith. And this teaches this perticle (by him let us offer) that is to say,
by faith in Christ. Breuely, the service and worshyppyng commanded by the
new testament is spiritual, that is to say, is justice of faith in the heart,
and the fruits of faith. Therefore it does abrogate the leuiticall sacrifices.
And Christ says: The true worshyppers shall worship the father in spirit
and truth. Io. 4.
For such worshyppers would the father have to worship him God is a spirit
and they that ^orshyp him, must worship him in spirit and truth. This text
clearly condempneth the opinions of all such sacrifices, which they feign to
be of strength by the reason of the work wrought. And it teaches also, that
we must worship in spirit, y^ is to say, with motions of the heart and
faith. Therefore the prophets also in the old testament co^dempne the opinion
of the people, which they had of the work wrought, and do teach ryghtuousnes
and sacrifices of the spirit. For thus says the prophet Hieremie. Hier. 7
I have not spoken with your fathers nor I have not given them commandment in
that day when I brought them out of Aegipte, of any sacrifices: But this
word I commanded them, saying, Hear and obey my words, and I will be your
god. etc. After what fashyon should we think, that the Jews did harken and
receive this sermon, which seems to be clean repugnant and contrary to the
law of Moses? For this was undoubtedly known, that god had given
commandment to the fathers of diverse manner sacrifices. But Hieremie
condempneth the opinion, which they had of sacrifices. This opinion god did
never teathe them, y^ is to wit, that those sacrifices should pacify him by
the work wrought. He adds also faith, that god had commanded it, when he
says, Harken me, that is to say, believe me, that I am your god, that I will so
be known, when I do show mercy, and wha^ I do help, and y^ I have no need of
your sacrifices, trust surely, that I will be god a iustifier, a savior, not
for your works sake: but for my word, and my promise sake, desire and look
for help of me truly and from your hearts.

The psalm also does condemn the opinion of the work wroughte, psalm 49
which refusing the sacrifice of beasts, requires invocation* and the
sacrifice of praise. For thus it says. Shall I eat the flesh of bulls and
of gotes? etc. Call upon me in the time of tribulation, and I will deliver the,
and thou shalt worship and honor me. etc. Here he witnesses that this is
the very latria, the very true honor, if we do hertely call upon him.

Also in the.xxxix. psalm it is written, Sacrifice and oblation thou would
none of, psalm. 391
but thou haste made perfect and opened mine ears, that is to say, thou have
set forth and propowned a word unto me, which I should hear, and thou
requirest that I should believe thy word* and thy promyses, which be, that thou
will in very deed have mercy, will succoure. etc. Also in the.l. psalm.
psalm. 50
Thou shalt not delight in the hole burnt sacrifices. The sacrifice acceptable
to god, is a troubled spirit, A contrite and humbled heart (o god) thou wylt
not despise. Also in the.iiij. psalm, psalm. 4.
Sacrifice ye the sacrifice of justice, and hoope ye in the lord. He byddeth
here to hope, and says, that it is a rightuouse sacrifice, meaning that other
sacrifices be not true nor ryghtuouse sacrifices. And in the.Cxv. psalm, psalm
115
I shall sacrifice the sacrifice of praise, and I shall call upon the name of
the lord. He callethe here invocation the sacrifice of praise. But what
proceed we in cytynge these places, the scripture is full of such testimonies,
which teach that sacrifices reco^cile not god by the virtue of them selves.
And therefore it teaches that in the new testament (the leuitical sacrifices
being abrogated) new, clean, and pure sacrifices shall be made, that is to
wit, faith, invocation, thanks gyuynge, confession, and preaching of the
gospel, afflictions for the gospelles sake, and other like things. And of
these sacrifices speaks Malachias the prophet, Mala. 1
saying: Ab ortu solis usque ad occasum magnu^ est nomen meum in gentibus and
in omni loco sacrificatur and offertur nomini meo oblatio munda. That is to
say, From the east to the west, my name is great among people and nations,
and in every place is offered encense to my name, and pure and clean oblation.
This place our adversaries do wreste and apply to the mass, and they allege
the authority of the fathers. But the answer is easy, for though he spoke
never so much of the mass: yet it follows not that y^ mass justifies of it
own selue / or that the mass applied to others deserves unto them remission
of sins.

The true interpretation of the prophate,
None of all these says the prophet, which yet monks, freers, and
sophisters do imagyne and feign full shamefully that he should speak. But the
very self words of the prophet declare sufficiently his meaning. For first
they purpose that the name of the lord shall be great, this is done by the
preaching of the gospel. For by it is notified and spredde the name of
Christ, and the mercy of the father promised in Christ is thus known.
Preaching of the gospel engenders faith in them, which receive the gospel,
these call on god, these give thanks to god, these suffer afflictions in their
confessyng or preaching, these work well for the glory of Christ. Thus the
name of the lord is made great among the gentyles. Wherefore sacrifice and a
clean oblation signify not a ceremony nakedly done, but all those sacrifices,
by which the name of the lord is magnified, I mean, faith, invocation,
preaching of the gospel, confession. etc. And we easily suffer him that
lusts, to comprise a ceremony, so that he understands not only the
ceremony, neither teaches that the ceremony is auaylla^le of the own p^oore
virtue and strength. For like as among the sacrifices of praise, that is to
wit, among the praises of god, we comprise the preachi^ge of the word: so a
praise or thanks gyuyng may be the very taking or receyuyng of the sou^er of
the lord, but not of the own propre virtue, iustifienge us, or appliable to
other, to thentente to purchase unto them forgyuenes of sins. But we shall
not long hereafter declare, how a ceremony also is a sacrifice. But because
Malachie speaks of all the sacrifices of the new testamente: and not only
of the souper of the lord: Also because he furdereth nothing at al nor defend
the pharisaical opinion of the work wrought: therefore he makes nothing
against us, but rather makes with us. For he requires the honorynges and
sacrifice of the heart, by which the name of the lord is magnified and made
great in very deed. Mala. 3
There is cited also this place out of Malachie. Et purgabit filios Leui and
colabit eos quasi aurum and quasi argentum, and erunt domino offerentes
sacrificia in iusticia. That is to say. And he shall purge the sons of Leui,
and shall strain and cleanse them, as it were gold and silver, and they shall
offer to the lord sacrifices in justice. This place expressly requires the
sacrifices of ryghtuous men: wherefore it defendethe not the opinion of the
work wroughte. Now the sacrifices of the sons of Leui, that is to say, of
them that be teachers in the new testament be these, the preaching of the
gospel, To. 15.
and the good fruits of preaching. Likewise as Paul says to the Romans, I
do sacrifie the gospel of god, that the oblation of the gentyles might be made
acceptable, being sanctified by the holy ghost, that is to say, that the
gentyles might be made sacrifices acceptable to god by faith. etc. For that
kyllyng of beasts in the law, did signify both the death of Christ, and
the preaching of the gospel, by which this oldenes of the flesh must be
mortified, and the new and eternal life must be bego^ne in us. But our
adversaries, do every where wreste the name of sacrifice to the only ceremony:
but of preaching the gospel, of faith, invocation, and other like things
they speak nothing, and yet the ceremony was instituted for those things.
And the new testament ought to have sacrifices of the heart, and not
ceremonials to be done for sins, after the manner of the preesthode
leuiticall. They allege also a continual sacrifice, that likewise as in the
law the sacrifice was contynuall: so the mass ought to be the continual
sacrifice of the new testament. Allegores prove nothing.
^ur adversaries be happy and in good case, if we do suffer our selves to be
ouercomen with allegories. But it is known well enough, that allegories make
no strong probations / how be it we for our part can be well contented,
that the mass be understood to be a continual sacrifice: so that they
understand the hole mass, I mean the ceremony with preaching of the
gospel, and with faith, invocation, and thanks gyuynge. For these things
joined together be the continual sacrifice of the new testament. For the
ceremony was instituted because of these things, 1. cor. 11
and ought not to be disseuered from them. Therefore Paul says. So often as ye
shall eat this bread, and shall dri^ke of the cup of the lord, show the
death of the lord. But this thing does in no wise follow this figure
leuitical, that the ceremony is a work iustifienge by the own propre virtue,
or that it is a work to be applied for others, that it may merit unto them
remission of sins. etc. And the type or figure does aptely express, not
only the ceremony, but also the preachi^g of the gospel. Na. 2^.
In the book of Numeri there be put three parts of that daily sacrifice, that
is to say, the brennyng of the lamb* libation, and oblation of flower. The
law had pictures or shadows of things to come. Therefore in this spectacle
and figure Christ and the hole honor and service of the new testament is
painted. The brennynge of the lamb, signifies the death of Christ. Libation
betokens, that euerywhere throughout the world* those that believe be
sprencled with the blood of the lamb, that is to say, by the preaching of the
gospel, be sanctified (as Peter speakethe) into the sanctification of spirit*
in to obedience, and sprinclynge of the blood of Jesus Christ. The oblation of
flower, signifies faith, invocation, and thanks gyuynge in the hertes.
Therefore as in the old testament we se the shadow: so in the new testament
the thing signified is to be sought out, and not another figure is sufficient
to sacrifice. Wherefore although the ceremony is the memorial of Christis
death: yet nevertheless it alone is not the continual sacrifice, but the very
remembrance is the continual and daily sacrifice (that is to wit) the
preaching of the gospel, and faith, which does truly believe, that god is to
us reconciled by the death of Christ. There is required libation (that is to
say) theffecte of the preaching, that we by the gospel, being aspersed with
the blood of Christ, might be sancrified, being mortified and quickened.
There be also required oblations (that is to say) gyuyng of thanks,
confessions, and afflictions. So than (this pharisaical opinion of the work
wroughte set aparte) let us understand, that there is signified a spiritual
worship, and a continual sacrifice of the heart, because in the new testament
not the shadow, but the body of good things, I mean, the holy ghost,
mortification, and vivification ought to be required. By these things it
appears that the continual and daily sacrifice makethe nothing against us,
but rather for us. We require all the parts signified by continual sacrifice.
Our adversaries falsely dream, that thonlye ceremony is betokened, and not
also preaching of the gospel, mortification, and vivification of the heart,
with such other.

Now therefore good men may easelye judge, that this is a very false accusation
to say, that we take away the continual and daily sacrifice. The thing it self
shows, who be those Antiochi, which reign in the church, which under
pretense of religion, draw unto them selves the kingdom of the world, and
castyng away all care of godly living and teaching the gospel, play the
lords, make war like princis and kings of the world, which have
instituted new ceremonies in the church. For our adversaries in the mass
only retain the ceremony, and abuse it openly to cursed lucre and sacrilege.
And yet they feign that these work, if it be applied for other, does merit
unto the^ grace and al goodness. In their sermones they teach not y^ gospel,
they comfort not consciences, they show not that sines be freely forgyuen for
Christ's sake: but they set forth before us, and teach us honoring of
saints, humayne satisfactions, humayne traditions. By these things they say,
that men be justified before god. And where as certain of these before
rehearsed be manifestlye wicked: yet be they defended with force and violence.
That if any preachers of them covet to be taken for more connyng, and better
learned than the rest, they teach questions of philosophy, which neither the
people, neither yet them selves understand. Finally, they which be of most
tolerable sort among them teach the law, but of the justice of faith they
speak no word. Our adversaries in the co^futation make wonderful tragedies,
and sorrowful exclamatio^s about the desolation of churches. saying, that the
altares stand vnadourned, without candelles, without images. These tryfelynge
things they judge to be the adournamentes of the churches. Dani. 9
But Daniel signifiethe a far other manner desolation to come to the church
(that is to wit) the ignorance of the gospel. For the people oppressed with
the great nombre and variety of traditions and opinions, could in no wise
receive theffecte and sum of the christian doctrine. For what one of the
come^ people understood the doctrine of repentance, which our adversaries
have taught? And yet this is the principal point of the christen doctrine.
Consciences were vexed with the reckoning up of perricular sins, and
satisfactions: But as concerning faith, by which we freelye obtain
remission of sins, no mention was made by our adversaries, I say of
thexercises and labors of faith, who wresteleth against desperatio^, of the
free remission of sins for Christis sake, all the books, all the sermones of
our adversaries were stark dumme.

To these things before rehearsed has been added an horrible profanation and
abusyng of masses, and many other wicked ceremonies and services in churches.
This is the desolation, which Daniel describes.

Dani. 9 The doctrine of the preachers i^ Germanye.
On the other side, our priests (thanks be given to god for his goodness)
teach the gospel of the benefits of Christ, and show that remission of
sins comes freely for Christis sake. This doctrine bryngethe strong and
sure consolation to consciences. There is also added the doctrine of good
works, which god commands. The use also and dignity of the sacraments is
taught among us.

That if the use of the sacrament were a continual and daily sacrifice: yet
should we retain and keep the said sacrifice more than our adversaries. For
among them priests use the sacrament, because they be hired for wages and
rewards. With us the use of the sacrament is more often and also more devout
and holy. For the people use the sacrament, but they be first taught and
examined. For they be taught and instructed of the true and right use of the
sacrament, which is that it was ordained for this entente, that it should be a
seal and testimony of free remission of sins. And therefore it ought to
teach fearful consciences, and to put them in remembrance, to be assured and
certain within them selves, and to believe that their sins be freely forgyuen
them. For asmoche then, as we retain stylle both the preaching of the
gospel, and the laufull use of the sacraments: there remains stylle with us
the continual sacrifice. And if we should speak of the outward sight and
show to the iye: there is greatter resort of people in our churches, than in
the churches of our adversaries. For the people be kept together with
profitable and plain sermones. But as for the doctrine of our adversaries,
neither y^ people, neither the doctors them selves ever understand it. And
the very true apparaylyng and deckyng of temples is godly doctrine, profitable
and plain to the hearers, the godly use of the sacraments* fervent prayer,
and such other. Candelles, vessels of gold, and like ornaments be in deed
semely: but they be not the propre and very deckyng of the church. That if
our adversaries set the honor of god in such manner things, and not in
preaching of the gospel, in faith, in thexercises and batayles of faith:
they may be accounted in the nu^bre of them, whom Daniel describes to worship
their god with gold and silver. Dani. 11


An objection taken out of the epistle to the Hebrews, the.v. chaptre
They allege also forth of the epistle to the Hebrews this text. Omnis
pontifex ex hominibus assumptus pro hominibus co^stituitur in his quae sunt ad
deu^, ut offerat dona and sacrificia pro peccatis. That is to say. Every bishop
taken from among men is ordained for men's cause in those things, which
apperteyne to god to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins. Hereof they
reason, that forasmuch as there be bysshopes and prestes in the new
testament: it follows that there is also some sacrifice for sins. This place
most of al other does move them which be unlearned / namely when the pomp of
the presthod and sacrifices of the old testament is cast before their eyes.
This similitude does deceive unlearned men, and causes them to judge that
there ought after the same manner some ceremonial sacrifices be among us,
which should be applied for the sins of other men, as it was in the old
testamente. Neither is that sacrifice of Masses and the other policy and
ordenaunce of the pope any other thing, then a counterfaytyng of the leuiticall
ordenaunce or policy natryghtly nor well understood. And albeit that our
sentence has chief testimonies in the epistle to the Hebrews. Yet our
adversaries wrest places forth of the same epistle (but yet mangled and
mayhemed) against us / as in this same place where it is said, that the
bishop is ordained to offer sacrifices for sins: the scripture immediately
adds mention of Christ the bishop. The words going before speak of the
leuiticall presthode / and they mean that the leuitical byshopryk or presthode
was the image of the bysshopryche or presthode of Christ. For the leuiticall
sacrifices made for sins did not merit remission of sins before god, only
they were an image or figure of the sacrifice of Christ, which only should be
the propitiatory sacrifice as we said before. Therefore a great part of the
epistle is spe^te about this place, that the old bysshopryche or presthode and
the old sacrifices were not instituted for this entente, that they should
merit remission of sins before god, or reconciliation: but only to signify
the sacrifice that was to come of Christ only. For the saints in the old
testament must needs be justified by the believe of the promise that remission
of sins should be given for Christ's sake: likewise as good men in the new
testament be justified by faith. All saints and holy men that have been syns
the beginning of the world, must needs think that Christ which was
promised, should be the sacrifice and satisfaction for sin. Esaie. 53.
As Esaie teaches in the.liii. chapitre saying. When he shall put his life to
be an host or sacrifice for sins. etc. For as much therefore as in the old
testament the sacrifices merit not reco^ciliation but by a certain similitude
(for they did merit political reconciliation) but did signifye a sacrifice to
come: it follows that the only sacrifice of Christ was applied for other
men's sins. There is therefore no sacrifice left in the new testament to be
applied for the sins of other besides the only sacrifice of Christ upon the
cross. They be quyte and clean out of the way which ymagine, that leuiticall
sacrifices did merit remission of si^nes before god / and so according to the
ensample thereof, require, and seek other sacrifices to be applied for other in
the new testament besides the death of Christ. This ymagination utterly
quenches the merit of Christ's passion, and the justice of faith, and
corrupts the doctrine of the old and new testament / and in the stead of
Christ makes unto us other mediators and reconcilers / that is to wete
bishops and prestes, which daily selle their labor in churches. Wherefore if
any man will make this reason, that there ought in the new testamente a bishop
to be, which may offer for si^nes: this is to be granted only of Christ. And
this solution does the hole epistle to the Hebrews co^fyrme. And it should be
utterly to make other mediators besides Christ: if we should require any other
satisfaction to be applied for the sins of other and to reconcile god,
besides the death of Christ. Moreover because the presthode of the new
testament is a ministration of the spirit (as Paul teaches i^ the second
epistle to the Corinthes) therefore it has the only sacrifice of Christ
satisfactorie, 2. cor. 3.
and applied for the sins of other. But it has no sacrifices like to the
leuiticall sacrifices, which may by the own propre virtue be applied for
other / but it offerith and ministereth to other the gospel and sacraments /
to the en^e that by these they may conceive faith, and the holy ghost, and may
be mortified and quickened. For the ministry of the spirit is contrary and
clean repugnau^te to the applyeng of the work wrought. For that is the
ministry of the spirit by which the holy ghost works strongly in the
hearts. Wherefore it has such manner ministration which does so profet other
men: when it works and is strong in them and when it renueth and quyckeneth
them. This is not by applieng of another man's work for others, eue^ by the
virtue of the very work that is wrought, as they call it. We have showed the
cause why the mass does not justify by virtue of it self, nor being applied
for others does merit remission of sins to them. For both these things be
contrary to the justice of faith. For it is impossible that remission of
sins should be gotten / or that the terrors of sin and death should be
overcome by any works or by any thing, but by faith in Christ / according
to that saying of Paul, To. 5.
Iustificati ex fide pacem habemus. We justified by faith have peace. Besides
this we have showed, that the scriptures alleged against us defend not the
wicked opinion of our adversaries concerning the work wrought, and that may
all good men judge of every nation and country. Wherefore the error of Thomas
is to be rejected, who wrote, The error of thomas rejected
that the body of the lord ones offered upon the cross for original sin* is
daily offered upon the alter for daily sins / so that the church in this,
might have a gift to pacify and reconcyle god. The other comen errors also ar
to be forsaken, as that the mass gives grace to the doer by the virtue of the
work wrought. Also that the mass applied for other, yea sinners also and
unjust persons, so that they put no impedient of their part, does merit
unto them selves remission of sins, both (as they say) a culpa et pena. All
these things be false and wicked, and have been newly imagined by unlearned
freers / and they drown the glory of Christ's passion, and the justice of
faith. Of these errors other errors innumerable have sprongen, as of how
great strength the masses be, when they be applied for many together, and
how much they avail when they be applied for every man particularly.
Sophisters have the degrees of merits set forth, even as goldsmythes have the
degrees of wayghtes in gold or silver. Besides this, they selle the mass, as
a price to obtain what soever any man desyrethe, to merchant men, that they
may have prosperous byenge and sellyng, to hunters, that they may have
prosperous hunting, and so of other things infinite. Finally they apply it
also to dead men, they deliver souls by the applyenge of the sacrament, from
the pains of Purgatory, where as without faith the mass profits no not them
that be alive. Neither can our adversaries bring forth so much as one
syllable of the scriptures to the mayntenau^ce of these tryfles and lies,
which they teach with great authority in the church. Neither have they any
testimonies of the ancient Church, or of the fathers.

The opinions of the fathers concerning sacrifice.
BUT because we have declared the places of scripture, which be alleged
against us, we must now make answer also concerning the old fathers.

We know well enough, that the Mass is called of the old fathers a
sacrifice, but their mind is not that the mass by the virtue of the work
wrought does give grace, and that it applied for other, does merit unto them
remission of sins, both of the crime, and also of the punyshement. Where be
any such mo^struous words read in the warkes of the old fathers? but they
openly witness, that they speak of thanks gyuynge / and therefore they call
it by the greek word Eucharistia, thanks gyuynge. The sacrifice of the Mass
called of the fathers Eucharistia. ^. a gyui^g of thanks
Now we have said before, that a sacrifice Eucharistical does not merit
reco^ciliation, but it is done and made by them that be alredye reconciled.
Likewise as afflictions merit not reconciliation, but than they be
Eucharistical sacrifices, when they that be reconciled suffer them. And this
answer in general to the sayenges of the fathers, does sufficiently defend
us against our adversaries. For certain it is, that those figmentes and
imaginations of the merit of the work wroughte be read no where in the
writings of the fathers. But to the^te^t that the hole cause may be the more
clerelye perceived: we also shall speak touchi^g the use of the sacrament,
those things, which be without question agreinge to the sayenges of the
fathers, and to scripture.

Of the use of the sacrament, and of sacrifice.
Certain pleasant fellows feign and imagine, A vain opinion
that the souper of the lord was instituted for two causes. The one is, y^ it
should be a mark and testimony of profession, likewise as the certain facyon
of a monks or a freers habit is a toke^ of a certain profession or order.
Secundarily they think, that such manner sign and token, that is to wit, a
souper, or maundy did chyefely please Christ, to the end it should signify a
conjunction and frendshyp of christian men among them selves each to other. For
drynkyng and eating together is a token of love and frendshyppe. But this is
but a civil opinion / and does not show the chyefe and princihall use of
things taught by god. Only it speaks of charity to be exercised, which
lay and civil men do after a fashyon understand, but it speakethe not of
faith, which few men understand what it is.

What is a sacrament.
Sacraments be signs and tokens of the will of god toward us / and not only
tokens of men among them selves. And they very well define sacraments in the
new testament, to be signs and tokens of grace. And because in a sacrament
there be two things, the sign, and the word. The word in the new testament
is the promise of grace, which is added to the sign. The promise of the new
testament, is the promise of remission of sins* as the text says here. 1.
cor. 11 mat. 26 mar. 14. Luc. 22
This is my body, which is given for you, This is the cup of the new
testament with my blood, which shall be shed forth to the remission of
sins, The word therefore offerythe forgyuenes of sins. And the ceremony is
as it were a pycture or a seal of the word (as Paul calls it) showing the
promise. Therefore likewise as the promise is unprofitable, onles it be received
by faith: so is the ceremony also unprofitable, onles faith be put unto it,
who decrees and believes verelye, that here is offered remission of sins.
This faith comforts and lyfteth up co^trite and troubled minds. And
likewise as the word was given to stir up this faith: So the sacrament was
ordained for this entente, that the visible sign set forth unto the iye
should move the hertes to believe. For by these things, I mean by the word,
and by the sacrament, the holy ghooste does work. And such manner use of the
sacrament, when faith quickens troubled and fearful hertes, is a sacrifice
of the new testamente. For the new testamente has spiritual motions, that
is to say, mortification, and vivification. And to this use did Christ
institute it, when he byddethe us do it for a memorial and remembrance of
him. For to remember Christ is no vain or idle celebration of the sight or
show, or instituted only for example, as we se in tragedies, the memory of
Hercules or Ulisses to be honorably made: But it is to remember the benefits
of Christ, and to receive them by faith, so yt we may be quickened by them.
Therefore the psalm says. A memory has the most merciful lord made of his
merueiles / he has given meat to the^, that fear him. For he signifies and
means, that the will and mercy of god should be acknowleged in that
ceremony. But faith, which knowlegeth and confesses mercy, does
undoubtedly make a live. And this is the principal use of the sacrament,
whereby it appears who be mete and convenient persons to this sacrament (that
is to wit, troubled consciences and throughlye made affrayde) and also how
they ought to use the same. There is put to also a sacrifice, for there be many
ends of one thing. After that the conscience lyfted up and conforted with
faith, has felt and perceived out of what manner fears it is delivered:
than verily it truly gives thanks for the benefit and passion of Christ /
and does use the ceremony to the laud and praise of god, to the end that by
this obedience it may show due kyndnes / and may knowledge it self to esteem
greatly the gifts of god. So the ceremony is made a sacrifice of praise. And
the fathers speak of two effects (that is to wit) of the consolation and
confortyng of consciences / and of gyuyng of thanks or praise. The first of
these two effects apperteyneth to the nature of a sacrament. The second
apperteyneth to a sacrifice* Of consolation, Ambro.
thus speaks S. Ambrose. Recedite ad cum and absolu^imini, qui^^ est remissio
peccatorum. Qui sit iste quaeritis. Audite ipsum dicentem. Ego sum panis uitae,
qui uenit ad me non esuriet, and qui credit in me non sitiet unquam. That is to
say. Draw nere to him, and be assoyled / for he is remission of sins.
Peradventure ye demand of me, who this is? Harken what he says his own
self. I am the breadde of life, who so ever comes to me, shall not be hungry
/ and who soever believes in me, shall never be thrustye. Here he witnesses,
that in the sacrament is offered remission of sins. He witnessethe also,
that it ought to be received by faith. A thousand like testimonies, having
the same sentence that this has, be read among the fathers works, which
every of them our adversaries do yet wreste and wrynge to the work wroughte,
and to be applied for other men: where as the fathers do openly require faith,
and speak of the peculiar consolation of every man particularly, and speak
not of application for other. Besides this there be read also sentences of
thanks gyuynge, as for example, that sentence most swetely spoken of
Cypriane, concerning them that in due and godly wise receive the sacrament.
Cipan.
Pietas inter data and condonata se diuidens gracias agit tam ube^is beneficij
largitori. That is to say. Piety or godlynes deuidyng it self between the
things given, and the things forgyuen, gives thanks to the gyuer of
plentiful benefits, (that is to say) it consy^^^eth the things that be
given, and the things that be forgyuen, (that is) it compares together the
greatness of the benefits of god, and the greatness of our euylles, as of
death, and of sin, and gives thanks. etc. And hereof came up the name of
Eucharistia in the church. Neither is the ceremony it self a gyuyng of
thanks by the virtue of the work wroughte to be applied for other men, to
merit to them remission of sins, or to deliver the souls of dead men.
These things be repugnaunt and contrary to the justice of faith, as who
should say, that the ceremony without faith could profete either the doer or
others.

Of the names of the Mass.
OUR adversaries call us back again unto gra^mer, they take arguments of the
names of the mass, which need not any long disputation. For it folowethe not,
that the mass, although it be called a sacrifice, is a work gyuynge grace, by
the virtue of the work wroughte, or applied for others, does merit remission
of sins to them. Liturgia, the greek word (say they) betokens the same
that Sacrificiu^ does in the latin tongue. And the greeks call the mass
Liturgiam. ergo. etc. Why do they here leave out the old name Synaxis, which
word shewethe that the Mass was in old time a communion and participation of
many men? But let us make answer to Liturgia. This word does not signify
properly a sacrifice, What is Liturgia.
but rather a comen ministry or service, and greethe very metelye to our
sentence, that is to wit, that one ministre consecratyng, does exhibete to
the residue of the people, the body and blood of our lord: likewise as one
ministre teaching, ministers and gives to the people y^ gospel of Christ, as
Paul says, Let men so judge us, as of the ministers of Christ, and
distributers of the mysteries or sacraments of god, that is to wit, of the
gospel, and of the sacraments, and in the second to the Corinthianes he
says: 2. cor. 5
For Christ's cause we execute this Ambassade even as though god did desire you
by us: we pray you for Christ's cause that ye be reconciled* etc. So the name
of Liturgia agreythe very conuenientlye to a ministry. And it is word used
in the publyke ministeries. And among the greeks it signifies comen charges,
as tribute, costs of prepayryng their navy, or other like things, as
witnesses the oration of Demostenes, Demosthenes
which he made against Leptine, which said oration he spends al together
in disputation of the comen offices and liberties, where he uses this word
Liturgia, signifienge comen charges. And so they spoke also in the time of the
Romans, as it appears in the rescripte of Pertinax the emperor in the
paragraffe De iure immunitatis, in the law Semper. There also Liturgia is used
for comen charges. And the comentarie of Demosthenes writes, y^ Liturgia is a
kind of tributes / the costis of the comen plays, the costis of prepayrynge
their ships, and of such other comen charges. And Paul used the same word
for a comen ministratio^ of almoyse in the second epistle to the Corinthes, 2.
cor. 9
saying, The office of this comen gyuyng of almoyse, not only suppliethe the
need of the saints: but also it causethe that the moo do give thanks
plentuously to god. etc. And in the second to the Philippianes he callethe
Epaphrodite Liturgon (that is to say) a ministre of his necessite, Phili. 2
in which place without doubt by that word can not be understood a preeste.
But we shall not need to bring forth any mo testimonies, for asmoche as
examples do offer them selves every where to them y^ read Greek auctours / in
whose works Liturgia is used for the come^ civil charges or offices. And
because of the diphto^ge, gra^marions do not bring forth this word out of
Lite, which betokenethe prayers: but it has his name of the publyke and
common goods, The etimologe of this word liturgy
which they call Leita / so that Leiturgeo is asmoche to say, as I do order
and have y^ charge and ha^dling of the goods of the comen weal. But it is a
mad thing that they do thus reason, mention of the altar is made in holy
scripture, ergo, the mass must needs be a sacrifice / for the parable of the
altar is alleged of Paul by a similitude. And this word Missa, they feign
to be said of an altar in the Hebrew tongue. But what need they to fetch the
Etimologie so far, onles it were because they would show forth their
conning in the Hebrew tongue? What neded to seek the Etymology so far, when
we read this word Missa in the book of Deuteronomie, Deu. 16
where it signifies collations or gifts of the people, and not the oblation
of the priest. For every one that came to the solemn feast of Easter, was
bound to bring some gift for their portion and shot toward the comen
souper. This manner did christen men keep at the beginning. When they came
together, they brought loves of bread, wine, and other things, as
witnessethe the canones of the apostles. Thereof a part was taken to be
consecrate. The rest was distributed to y^ poor. with this manner they also
retained the name of collations or shottes. And by reason of such collations,
it appears also y^ the mass otherwhyles is called Agape (that is to say) a
charity, onles perchance a man had rather have it so called, because of the
come^ refectio^ or souper. But let us pass over these trifles. For I wonder
that thaduersaries bring forth so light and sclendre conjectures in so great
and wayghtie a matier. For though the mass be called an oblation: what makes
this word to those dreams of the work wroughte, and of the applicacion,
which they feign to merit unto others remission of sins? In deed it may be
called an oblation, because there be offered prayers, thanks gyuyng, and all
that hole ceremony: likewise as it is called Eucharistia. But neither the
ceremonies, neither the prayers be profitable by the own virtue without faith.
How be it here we dispute not of the prayers, but properly of the souper of the
lord.

The Greek canon also speaks many things of oblation: but it declares
openly, The Greek Canon of the Mass.
that it speaks not properly of the body and blood of our lord, but of the
hole mass, of y^ prayers, and thanks gyuynge. For the Greek word may be
thus translated in to our english tongue. And make us worthy to offer unto
the, o lord, prayers, supplications, and sacrifices, unbloody for all the hole
people.

If this be right understand, there is no hurt in it. For it desyrethe that
we may be made worthy to offer prayers and supplicatio^s, and unbloody
sacrifices for the people. It calls the very prayers unbloody hosts or
sacrifices. Likewise as a little after it says, Yet we offer unto the this
reasonable and unbloody honor. For they expound it folyshelye, who soever had
rather expound this place for a reasonable host, and apply it to the body of
Christ: when the canon speakethe of the hole service of the Mass. And Paul
uses this word, (reasonable honor) against y^ work wrought, meaning by it
the service of the mind, that is to say, fear, invocation, thanks gyuynge.
But where our adversaries defend the application of the ceremony for the
delyuerynge of souls out of Purgatory, by the reason whereof, they get
infinite lucre and money) they have no testimonies, nor co^mau^dmentes out of
the scriptures. Nota.
And it is no small sin to ordeyne such ceremonies or services in the
church without the commandment of god, or any example of the scripture, and
to apply unto dead men the souper of the lord, which was ordained for a
remembrance, and to be preached among quick men. This is to abuse the name
of god, against the second commandment / for first it is injury and
dishonor to the gospel / a man to think that the ceremony by virtue of the
work that is wrought without faith, is a sacrifice reconcilyng god, and
satisfienge for sins. It is, I say, an horrible and abominable saying, that
the work of the priest is of as much strength as is the death of Christ.
Secondarily, syn and death can not be ouercome^ but by faith in Christ as
Paul teaches / we justified by faith, Romans 5.
have peace, ergo the pain of Purgatory can not be ouercomen by the applyenge
of another man's work.

Purgatory.
We will pass over here what manner testimonies our adversaries have of
Purgatory / what manner pains they judge the pains of Purgatory be / what
manner causes the doctrine of satisfactions has, which doctrine we have here
before showed to be most vain. This thing only we shall lay against them /
it is most certain and undoubted, that the souper of the lord was ordained
for the remission of the gylte (for it offers remission of sins, in which
case we must nedis by it understand the gylte) and yet nevertheless it
satisfies not for the gylte / for than the mass should be egall to the death
of Christ. Neither remission of the gylte can ^e otherwise received then by
faith / wherefore we may conclude, that the mass is no satisfaction, but a
promise and sacrifice requiringe faith. And forsothe all good and godly men
can not but be sore grieved in their hearts if they should think that the Mass
for the most part is translated and applied to dead men / and to
satisfactio^s for pains. This is to take away contynual sacrifice out of the
church. This is the kingdom of Antiochus, which has translated the most
wholesome promyses of remission of sin, and of faith, unto the most vain
opinions of satisfactions. This is to defyle the gospel / to corrupre the use
of the sacraments. 1. cor. 11
These be they whom Paul said be gyltie of the body and blood of the lord /
which have oppressed the doctrine of faith and remission of sin, and under
the pretense of satisfactio^s have abused the body and blood of the lord to
most cursed lucre. But they shall one day suffer for this abominable
sacrilege. Wherefore we, and all good consciences must take heed that we
approve not the abuses of our adversaries. But let us return to our matier.
Forasmoche as the mass is not a satisfaction, neither for punyshement, nor for
syn by the virtue of the work wrought without faith / it follows that the
applieng of it for dead men is unprofitable. Neither do we need here any
longer disputation. For it is undoubted, that these applicatio^s for dead me^
be not grounded upon the scriptures. And it is ieoperdous to institute any
honor or service to god, without authority of scripture. That if we shall se
need at any time, we shall speak more largely of this matire. For whereunto
should we braule now with our adversaries, which neither understand what
sacrifice is, nor what a sacrament is / nor what remission of sins is, nor
what faith is. Neither does the Greek canon apply the oblation as a
satisfaction for dead men, for it applies it indifferently to all the blessed
patriarchs, prophets, and apostles. It appears therefore, that the Greeks
offer it as a thanks gyuing, and apply it not as a satisfaction for
punyshementes. Howbeit they speak not of the only oblation of the body and
blood of the lord: but of the other parts of the mass that is to wete, of
prayers, and thanks gyuing. For after the consecration, they pray that it may
profit them that receive it / they speak not of other men. Afterward they
add these words in their tongue. The words of the Greek Canon.
We offer also unto the this reasonable service for them, that rest in the
faith / our first fathers, patriarchs, prophets, and apostles. etc. But
reasonable service does not here betoken the very host: but signifies the
prayers and al things that be done there. Now where our adversaries allege
the fathers, as concerning oblation for dead men: we know, that the old
fathers speak of prayer made for dead men, which we will not forbydde / but
the applyeng of the souper of the lord for dead men because of the work
wrought, this we disalowe. Neither the old fathers defe^^e or adversaries i^
their opinion of the work wrought. And though they have never somuche the
testimonies of Gregory and of other writers o^ late time for them: Grego.
we set against them most open and most undoubted scriptures. Now there
is great vnlyknes and diversity betwixt scripture and fathers. They were men
and might err. Howebeit if they were now alive and saw their own sayenges
made a buckler and defense to those open lies, which our adversaries teach of
the work wrought: they would expoune their own sayenges far otherwise. Our
adversaries also falsely allege against us the condempnation of one called
Aerius / whom they say was condemned because he did deny that in the mass
oblation was made both for quick and dead. Aerius an heretyke.
This color they use often times / they allege old heresies, and with them
they falsely compare our cause, to the intent that with such comparison they
might make us more hated. Epiphanius witnessith, that the opinion of Aerius
was, that prayers for dead men be unprofitable. The opinion of Aerius.
This opinion Epiphanius reproves. Neither do we defend Aerius / but we
strive with you, which wyckedly defend an heresy, manifestly contrary to the
saying of the prophets, apostles, and holy fathers (that is to wete) that the
mass by the virtue of the work wroughte does justify / and that it does
merit remission of sins (as they call it) a pena et culpa even also to
unrighteous men, for whom it is applied, if they make no stop or impediment
of their own part. These poisoned errors we disalowe, which minishe the
glory of the passion of Christ, and utterly oppress the doctrine of the
justice of faith. Such like persuasion had the wicked Jews in the law,
that they merited remission of sins by their sacrifices, through the virtue
of the work wrought / and did not receive it freely by faith. Therefore they
encreaced those ceremonies and sacrifices / they ordained the honoring of Baal
in Israel / in Jury also they made sacrifice in the hallowed woods. Wherefore
the prophets condempnyng this persuasion did war not only with those
worshyppers of Baal, but also with other prestes, which made the sacrifices
ordained by god with that wicked opinion. But this persuasion cleauith in the
world, and shall cleave always, I mean that ceremonies and sacrifices be
redemptio^s of sins. Carnal men do not suffer this honor to be given only
to the sacrifice of Christ, that it is the very ransom and propitiation:
because they perceive not the justice of faith / but give egall honor to
other services and sacrifices. Therefore likewise as in Iurye there stycked a
false persuasion among the wicked bishops concerning sacrifices / and likewise
as in Israel there continued the worshipping of Baal and other like. And yet
nevertheless was the church of god among them, which did dysalowe and rebuke
those wicked sacrifices and services. So likewise in the kingdom of the pope
there remains the worshyppyng of Baal (that is to say) the abuse of the
mass, which they apply, to the end that they may by it merit to
unrighteous men remission of sin and of punyshme^t for si^ne. And this
worshyppyng of Baal with the Popes kingdom is lykely to continue until
Christ shall come to judge / and until the time that the glory of his coming
shall destroy the kyngedome of Antichriste. In the mean season all that truly
believe the gospel, ought to improve and rebuke those wicked services and
worshyppinges devised against the commandment of god, to obscure and dymme
the glory of Christ, and the justice of faith. These things we have spoken
breffly concerning the mass, to the intent that al good men in what country
soever they dwell, may know and understand, that we with great affection and
diligence defend the dignity of the mass and show the right use of it, and
that we have most rightuous causes to dissent and disagre from our
adversaries. And here we would that all good men took admonition and counsel,
that they do not help our adversaries, which defend the profanation and
abusyng of the mass / least they charge them selves with the feloushyp of
other men's sin. The business of true p^achers.
This is no tryflynge matter / but a wayghty cause and a great busynes / yea
no less then that business of Elie the prophet, which did improve and
vehemently rebuke the honourynge of Baal. Yet we have set forth this so great
a matter myldely and coldely / and we have now made answer without raylyng or
evil words. But if our adversaries do provoke us to gather together all
kinds of their abusynges of the mass, the matier shall not be so myldly
handeled.

Of abbey vows.
WIth us, in a certain town of Turingia called Isenacu^, more tha^ thyrty
years ago, there was a certain freer of saint Frau^ces order, John^ Hilten by
name, which of his own company was cast into prison, John^ Hylten.
because that he had rebuked certain very notorious abuses. For we have seen
the works which he wrote, by which it may be well enough perceived, what
manner doctrine it was that he taught. And they which knew him, report of
him, that he was a gentle old man, and sad without any waywardnes. This
John^ showed before many things, which partly have come to pass al ready, and
partly seem to be nere at hand / which things we will not recite, least any
man would interpret them to be rehearsed either of displeasure and euille will
toward some person, or else of favor, and for the pleasure of some man.
But in conclusion, when either by reason of age or of fylthynes of the pryso^,
he was fallen into disease and sickness he sent for the wardeyn of the place to
come unto him, that he might give him knowledge of his infirmity and sycknes.
When the wardeyn enflamed with pharisaical harred against him, had begone to
chyde with him, and to rebuke him sharply for his doctrine, which seemed to be
against the proffettes of the ketchyn / than this John^ leaving the mention of
his infirmity, and being inwardlye sorye and syghynge, said, that he was
right well co^tentid to suffer al those injuries for Christ's sake. For he had
neither written nor taught any thing that might appayre or hurt the state of
religious men / he only rebuked, A ^rophec^e.
he said, certain abuses notoriouslye known. But there shall another come
(said he) in the year of our lord god. M.D.xvj. which shall destroy you,
neither ye shall be able (...) resist him. This sentence concerning the decay
of the kyngedome of religious men, and the nu^bre also of the years his friends
afterward did find also written in his works, among the annotatio^s, which
he had left upon certain places of Daniel. And though how much this saying
is to be regarded, the proffe of the thing shall declare: yet be there other
signs and tokens, as sure and as undoubted as the gospel is, which threaten
a change to come unto the kingdom of freers, and other religious persons.
For it is evidently known how much hipocrisy there is in abbeys / how great
ambition / how great covetousness / how much blyndenes and ignorance / and
how much cruelty of every unlearned fool / how great vanity in sermones /
how great craft in imaginyng often times new ways to get money. And there
be other vices also besides these, which I list not at this time ^o rehearse.
Monasteries were s^oles.
And where as in old time abbeys were the schools of Christis doctrine, now
they be grown out of kind, as it were from a golden kind to an yirnye kind,
bryngyng nothing else but myschiefe and destruction. The rychest monasteries
only find and norysshe an idle multitude, which there under false pretense
of religion, fylle their bellyes, and play the cormorauntes upon the common
almoyse of the church. Unsauerie sal^.
But Christ teaches us of the unsavory salt, that it is wont to be cast out
and trodden under the foot. wherefore religious men with these manners sing
their own destinye. And besides all this there is another token now, which
is, that they be every where the causers and cou^sellers of putting good men
to death. These murders, (no doubt of it) god will shortelye revenge and
ponyshe. Neither do we here accuse all religious men, (For we suppose, that
every where there be some good men in monasteries which think but measurably
of humayne ceremonies and services, and which do not allow the cruelty,
which hypocrites exercise and use). But we dispute of the kind of doctrine,
which the chief deuisours of the co^futation now defend, and not whether
vows ought to be kept (for we think that laufull vows be to be kept) but
whether those services, and ceremonies merit remission of sins and
justification / whether they be satisfactio^s for sins / whether they be
egall to baptism / whether they be the fulfyllyng both of the commandments,
and of the counsaylles / whether they be the evangelical perfection / whether
they have merits of superogation / whether those merits applied to other men
may save them, to whom they be so applied / whether the vows be laufull, which
be made with these opinions / whether the vows be lauful, which under the
cloak and pretense of religion be taken only for the intent to fylle the
belly, and to live in ydlenes and ease / whether those be true vows, which men
be compelled to make against their wylles, or else be made of such that were
not of full age, to judge of the manner and kind of living, which have been
thrust in to monasteries by their parents, or their friends, to thentent that
they might be found and have their living of the comen cost without any
hynderaunce of their own puate patrimony / whether those vows be laufull,
which openly incline to an evil end, either because they be not kept
through infirmity and weykenes, or else because they, which be in those
felyshyps and companies, be compelled to approve and to help forwards the
abusions of masses / the wicked honoryng of saints / the counselles of ragyng
and exercisynge cruelty against good men.

Of these questions we dispute. And though we have in our confession spoken
many things of such manner vows, which also the canons of the popes improve
and disallowe: yet our adversaries bid, that all that we have brought forth,
should be rejected. For these words they have used. And it is a world to se
how they cauillate and tryfle away our reasons / and what they bri^ge to the
defense and fortifieng of their own cause. Wherefore we shall briefly over a
certain few of our arguments / and run in them we shall by the way make
answer, and avoid the cauillations of our adversaries. And for asmoche as
this hole matter has been diligently and plentuously handeled of Martine Luther,
Luther
in his book entitled of Monastical vows, we will become here but a reporter
and repeter of that book.

The.1. reason.
First of all* this is most certain and undoubted, that it is no laufull
vow, by which he that makes the vow does think, that he deseruethe
remission of sins before god / or that he satisfies for sins before god.
For this opinion is a manifest i^iurie to the gospel / which teachethe that
remission of sins is freelye given us for Christis sake. As it has been said
largely heretofore. We have therefore well alleged the place of Paul to the
Galathians, Gal. 5.
Ye be void from Christ, who soever be justified by the law, ye be fallen
from grace. Who soever seek remission of sins, not by faith in Christ, but by
mo^kyshe works: they mynyshe the honor of Christ, and crucify Christ
again. But berken (I pray you) harken, how the deuisours of the confutation
wade out here. The evasion of thaduersares.
They expoune this place of saint Paul only of the law of Moses / and they
add, y^ religious men observe all things for Christis sake / and go about to
live more nere to the rule of the gospel / in such sort that they may merit
eternal life. The Epiloge of the adversaries.
And they add an horrible conclusion in this wise, saying, wherefore all these
things be wicked, which be alleged against the religious life. O Christ, how
long will thou suffer these injuries and dishonours, which our enemies do
unto thy gospel? We said in the confession, that remission of sins is
freely received for Christ's sake by faith. If this be not the very saying of
the gospel / if this be not the sentence of the eternal father, which thou (o
most merciful Christ) that art in thy fathers bosom, dydest show to the
world, we be ryghtefully punyshed? But thy death is witness / thy
resurrection is witness / the holy ghost is witness / thy hole church is
witness, that this is the very sentence of the gospel / that we obtain
remission of sins, not for our own merits, but for thy sake by faith.
Paul, when he says, that men do not merit remission of sins by the law of
Moses, takes away much rather this praise from the traditions of men. And
this he witnesses openly to the Collosianes. If the law of Moses, which
was given by god, did not merit remission hf sins: how much less than do
these folysshe obseruaunces, disagreinge from the civil custom and manner of
living, merit remission of sins?

Our adversaries feign, A wicked imagination
that Paul does abrogate the law of Moses / and that Christ does so
succeed the law, that he does not freelye give remission of sins, but for
the works of other laws, if any be now devised. With this wicked and mad
opinion they utterly drown the benefit of Christ. Furthermore they feign,
that among them, which observe that law of Christ, religious men more
nearely observe it, than other men, because of their hypocritical and cloked
poverty, chastity, and obedience, when all that ever they do or say, is full
of simulation. They brag and boste of poverty, being in most high
abundance of all manner things. They boste of their obedience, when no kind of
men has more liberty than religious men. Of their single life I list not to
speak, which how clean and pure it is in most part of them, that study to
keep them selves chaste, one Gerson in his book shewethe. Gerson
And how many be there (I pray you) which study to live chaste? Be ye sure,
with this hypocrisy and similation religious men live more near unto the rule
of the gospel. Christ does not so succeed Moses, that for our works sake he
forgyueth sins: but y^ he does set his own merits his own propitiation
against the wrath of god for us, that we might freely be forgyue^. But who
soever besides the propitiation of Christ does plead his own merits against
the wrath of god, and goth about for his own merits to purchase remission of
sins, whether he brings the works of Moses law, or of the ten
commandments, or of Benetes rule, or of Austines rule, or of any other
rules: he does disanull and take away the promise of Christ / he has cast
away Christ, and is fallen from grace. This is the sentence and mind of
Paul. And consydre, O Charles, most mylde and gentle Emperor / Consydre ye
princes / Consydre ye of all ordres and degrees, how great is the
unshamefastness of our adversaries, when we did recite the place of Paul
containing this sentence: They wrote unto it these words, They be al wicked
which be alleged here against Monastical life. And what is more certain and
undoubted, than that men obtain remission of sins for Christis sake by
faith. And yet these lewd fellows dare call this sentence wicked. We doubt
not, but if ye had been monished of this place, ye would have seen this so great
blasphemye to have been scraped out of the co^futatio^. Now for asmoche as it
has been heretofore largelye declared the opinion to be wicked, that for our
own works we obtain remission of sins, we will be the shorter in this
place. For a wise reader may thereof easily conclude, that we deserve not
remission of sins by abbeye works. And therefore that blaspemye also is in no
wise to be suffered, which is red in Thomas, A wicked saying of whom.
that the profession of religion is ^galle to baptism. It is plain madness to
make the tradition of man, which ha^^ for ^t neither the commandment,
neither the promise of god, egall to the ordinance of Christ, which has for
it both the commandment, and the promise of god, and which conteyneth the
couenau^te of grace and of eternal life. The.2. reason^^
Secondly, obedience, poverty, and single life, so that it be not unclean, be
but exercises indifferent. And therefore holy men may use them without sin, as
Barnarde, Fraunces* and other holy men did use them. And they did use them for
a corporal utility, yt they might be the more expedite and re^ye to teach,
and to do other holy and virtuous works* and not because the very works of
them selves ^e services, which justify, or merit eternal life. Breffely, they
be of that sort, of which (...) speake^h to Timothe* 1. Timothe. 4.
Corporalis exercitacio ad modicum utilis est, Bodily exercise is profitable a
little. And it is lykelye enough that somewhere at this day there be good men
in Monasteries, which busye them selves in the ministration of the word, and
which use those obseruau^ces without any wicked opinions. But to think yt
those obseruau^ces ^e services and honorynges of god, by which we be co^pted
ryghtuous before god, and deserve everlasting life: this is plain contrary to
the gospel of the justice of faith, which teaches, that for Christis sake
justice is given to us and eternal life. It is contrary to the saying of
Christ. Frustra me colunt mandatis hominum.i. In vain they worship me with
traditions of men. It is contrary also to this sentence. Omne quod non est ex
fide pecc^tum ^st, To. 14.
All that is not of faith is sin. But how can they afferme, that these be
services, which god does approve as a ryghtuousnes before him, when they have
no warrantise of the word of god. But se the unshamefastness of thaduersaries.
They not only teach, that those obseruau^ces be services justifying before
god: but add also that they be more perfect services (that is to say) more
meretyng remission of sins and justification, than be any other kinds of
living. And here run together in a heap many false and poysone opinions.
They feign that they keep both the precepts and counsaylles. Afterward the
liberal men, because they ^reame that they have merits, more than be
sufficient to them selves: they selle them unto other. All these things be
full of pharisaicall vanity. For there can be no greater wyckednes, than to
think that they in such wise fulfill the ten commandments, that they
have merits more than they need, sithe it is so that these precepts (Thou
shall love thy lord god with all thy heart. Thou shalt not lust) accuse every
man be he never so holy. The prophet says, Every man is a liar (that is to
say) not having right opinion of god / not fearing god sufficientely, not
beleuynge god sufficiently. Wherefore religious men do falselye glory, that in
the keeping of abbeye life, the precepts be fulfilled, yea and more to. This
is false also, that the obseruau^ces of religious men, be works of the
counsaylles of the gospel. For the gospel does not counsel diversities of
apparayle, of meats, of renouncing of their own goods. These be traditions
of men, of all which it was said, Es^a nos non commendat deo, 1. cor. 8.
Meat does not make us acceptable to god. Wherefore neither they be honors
and services iustifienge, neither be they perfection: but rather wha^ they be
set forth cloked with these titles, they be the very doctrines of deuylles.
Uirginitie I grant is counsaylles, but yet only to those persons, which
have the gift, as it was said before. But it is a very poysone error to
think that the perfection of the gospel stands in traditions of men. For so
the religious persons also of the Machometistes might boste, that they have
the eua^gelical perfection. Neither does it stand in obseruyng of other
things, which be indifferent. What is euangelical perfection.
But because the kingdom of god is justice and life in the hertes: therefore
perfection is to encreace the fear of god, and the trust of the mercy
promised in Christ, and diligence and care to obey our calling, Likewise as
Paul describes perfection, we be says he transfourmed from clearenes in to
clearenes, as of the spirit of the lord. He says not, we take upon us now
this and now that habit of religion, or a su^drye fashyon of shoes, or another
manner of gyrdle. It is a pitiefull thing that such pharisaical, yea rather
mahometical words be read and herd in the church (that is to wit) that the
perfection of the gospel, and of the kingdom of Christ, which is eternal
life, does stand in these folyshe obseruaunces of garments, of meats, and of
such other tryfles.

Now harken our sad and discrete judges, how shameful a sentence they have
put in the confutation: The sentence of thaduersaries.
Thus they say, It is expressed in the holy scriptures, that the religious life
duly observed and kept, which through gods grace all religious persons may
observe and keep, does merit eternal life / and yt Christ has promised it
more largely to them, which shall forsake house or brethren. etc. These be the
words of our adversaries, in which this is first a very shameless lie, to
say that it is expressed in holy scripture, that Monastical life does merit
eternal life. For where do the holy scriptures in any place speak of
Monastical life? Thus our adversaries defend their cause / thus the wretched
men allege the scriptures, when every man knows, that Monastical life is a
thing newly devised: and yet they allege y^ authority of scripture, and say,
that this their decree is expressed in the scriptures. Besides this, they do
injury and dishonor to Christ, in saying, that me^ by Monastical life do
merit eternal life. God does not give this honor no not to his own law,
that it should merit eternal life, as he him self says plainly in the.xx.
chapitre of Ezechiel, Eze. 20
I gave unto them precepts, that were not good, and judgments, in which
they shall not live. First this is undoubted, that monkyshe life does not
merit remission of sins, but that we freely rece^ue it by faith, as it has been said before. Secondly this also is written, that for Christ's sake, thrughe
mercy is given eternal life to them, which by faith receive remission, and
plead not their own merits against the judgment of god, as Barnarde most
gravely and wisely does say, Barn.
It is necessary says he, first of all to believe, that remission of sins
can not be obtained nor had, but by gods indulgence and pardone.
Secundarilye, that thou cannest have no good work, onles he gives it unto
the. Finally, that thou can nest not by no manner works merit eternal life,
oneles it also be freelye given. Other things that follow, concerning the
same sentence, we have heretofore recited. And Barnarde adds in the end
these words, Let no man deceive him self. For if he consider well, he shall
find without any doubt, that he is not able, no not with ten thousands to
mete him, which comes against him with twenty thousands. Sithe than it is so,
that not so much as by the works of gods law, we can merit remission of
sins, or eternal life, but it is necessary to seek the mercy promised in
Christ: much less is such honor to be given to Monastical obseruau^ces
(saying their be nothing else but traditions of men) that they should deserve
remission of sins or eternal life. Thus they utterly destroy and burye the
gospel of free remission of sins, and of receyui^g the mercy promised in
Christ: who soever teach y^ the monkyshe life does merit remission of
sins, or eternal life, and they translate the trust, which is due to
Christ: unto those folyshe obseruaunces. In the stead of Christ they worship
thyr own coulles, their own fylthynes. And in as much as they the^ selves also
do need mercy, they do wyckedly, in that they feign merite^ of super erogation,
and sell them to other. We speak the more briefly of these things, because by
the matters which we have spoken before of justification / of repentance / of
humayne traditions / it is evident ynough^e, that monastical vows be not the
price, for which remission of sins and eternal life be given. And sithe it
is so, that Christ him self does call traditions unprofitable honors and
services: they be in no wise eua^gelical perfection. But our adversaries would
full wylyly seem to moderate the comen persuasion of pefection. They will not
say, that monastical life is perfection: but they say: it is the state of
gettyng perfetion. In faith properly said / and we remember, A moderation.
that this correction is made in Gersones works. For it apperith, that wise
men offendid with those unmeasurable praises of monastical life, because they
durst not utterly take from it the praise of perfection: they addyd this
correction, that it is the state of gettyng perfection. If we follow this
opinion, so shall monastical life be no whyt more the state of perfection, than
is the life of the plouman, or of the carpenter. For these be also states of
gettyng perfection. For all men, of whatsoever calling they be ought to
desire perfection (that is to wete) to grow and increase in the fear of god /
in faith / in loving of thyr neighbor / and in like spiritual virtues. We
read in histories examples of Eremites, saint Antony and other, which make
the kinds of living egal one to another. It is written that to Antony, An
history of saint Antony
when he desired of god to know how much he had profyted in this kind of
living, there was showed in his dream a certain shomaker dwelling in the
city of Alexandrie, to whom he was compared. On the morrow after, Antony
co^mith into the city, and goes unto the shomaker, to search and know his
exercises and gifts. When he had spoken with the man: he hearith nothing of
him, but that he did every morning in few words pray for the hole city, and
afterward did apply his craft and occupation. Here Antony perceived, that
justification is not to be imputed to that sort of living, which he had taken
upon him and professed. But our adversaries, although they now moderate the
praises of perfection: yet in very deed they think otherwise. For they sell
merits, and apply them for other: under this pretense, that they observe both
the precepts and also the cou^sayles. Wherefore in very deed, they think that
they have merits mo then they need. What is to challenge perfection unto them
selves, if this be not? Furthermore it is put in the co^futation, that
religious men labor to live more nere unto the rule of the gospel. It does
therefore put perfection in the traditions of men: if religious men live more
near to the rule of the gospel, because they have nothing propre, but all
comen / because they live without wives / because they obey their rule in
garments meats, and other like trifles.

Mat. 19
Also the confutation says, that religious men merit more ple^teously
everlasting life, it alledgith the scripture, Qui reliquerit doma^. etc.
Whosoever shall forsake house. here (god wot) the scripture gives perfection
to these counterfaited and fained religious. But this place of scripture makes
nothing for monastical life. For Christ does not mean, that to forsake
father, and mother, wife or bre^herne. is a work therefore to be done, because
it does merit remission of sins, and eternal life. Yea that forsakyng is a
cursed forsaking. For it is done with the injury of Christ, if any man will
therefore forsake father, or mother, or wife tha^ by this self work he may
merit remission of sins and eternal life. Of two manners of forsaki^g the
world.
But there be two manner of forsakynges / one is done without calling, and
without the commandment of god / this forsaking and renouncing Christ
allows not. For works chosen of our selves be unprofitable services. And
hereof it apperith more evidently, that Christ does not love this ronnyng away
or forsakyng: because he speakith of forsaking wife and children. But we know
that the commandment of god forbyddeth to forsake wife and children. There is
another manner forsakynge, which is done by the commandment of god (that is
to wete) when tyrauntes, or they which have authority over us compel us to
deny the gospel, or ^o break gods commandment. Here in this case we have
commandment, that we should rather suffer wrong / and rather suffer not
only our goods, our wife, our children to be taken from us: but even our life
also. This manner renou^cyng or forsakyng, Christ does allow, and therefore he
addith these words, for the gospel sake: to signifye that he does speak of
them, not which do injury to their wife and children: but which suffer wrong
for the confession of the gospel. We ought also to forsake our own body for
the gospel sake. But here it should be a folly to think, that it is honor or
service unto god for a man to kyl him self, and to forsake his own body
without the commandment of god: even so likewise it is a folyshenes to
think, that it is honor or service to god to forsake possessions, friends,
wife, children, without the commandment of god. It is therefore evident, that
the saying of Christ is evil applied to monastical life, Mat 19 Man 10
onles peradventure this part of Christ's saying do agree well unto it, that
they shall receive an hundredth fold as much in this life. For very many be
made religious men, not for the gospels sake: but for the bellyes sake, and for
love of ease / which instead of their own slendre patrimony and lyuelod, do
find great riches. But as all the life of religious men is full of simulation
and hypochrisye: even so under a false pretense and color they allege the
testimonies of scripture, so that they commit double sin (that is to were)
they both deceive men, and also they deceive them under the pretense of gods
name.

There is another place also alleged of perfection. Si uis perfectus esse.
etc. Mat 19
If thou will be perfect, go and sell all that ever thou haste, and give to
pore folk, and come and follow me. This place has troubled many men which
have ymagined, that perfection is to cast away possessions and property of
things. Let us suffer the philosophers to praise Aristippus, Aristippus.
which did cast away a great sum of gold into the Sea: Such manner
examples nothing apperteine to the christen perfection. The division of
things, dominions, and possession of gods be civil ordinances approved by
the word of god in this commandment (Thou shall do no theft) ^ut the
forsakyng of man's own goods, has no commandment ne consayle in the
scriptures. Eua^gelical poverty. David was poor. A false praise of the
Extrauagau^t.
For evangelical poverty is not the forsakyng of goods: but it is / not to
be covetous / not to trust to riches. As David was pore in his most rich
kingdom. Wherefore sith the forsakyng of man's own goods is a mere tradition
of man: it is an unprofitable service. And those be unmeasurable praises of the
extrauagant, which says, that forsakynge of the property of al manner
things for gods sake is a meritorious and holy thing / and the way of
perfection. Certes it is a very dau^gerful thing so immeasurably to praise the
thing which is contrary to the civil custom. But Christ (say they) here
calls it perfection. Nay they do injury and wrong to the text, which
allege it thus may hemed and imperfect / perfection sta^dith in this which
Christ adds. Follow me. An example of obedience is set forth to us, Note
this solution.
in the calling. And because callynges be in sundry wyses: therefore this
calling apperteineth not to al men, but belongith only to that person with
whom Christ speaks there / as the calling of David to the kingdom / and of
Abraham to sle his son, be not to be followed of us. The vocatio^s be
personal, likewise as the busynesses selves do vary in times and persons,
Personal vocations
but the example of obedience is general. That young man should have had
perfection, if he had believed and obeyed that calling. So likewise in us it is
perfection, every man in true faith to obey his own calling.

The.3. reason.
Thyrdly in abbey vows is promised chastity. But we have said before when we
spoke of the marriage of prestes, that the law of nature in men can not be
taken away with any vows or laws. And because al men have not the gift of
continencye, many men through weykenes do full vnhappyly co^tayne. Neither can
any vows or any laws defete this commandment of the holy ghost. For
thaduoydynge of fornication, let every man have his wife. 1* cor. 7
Ergo, this vow is not laufull in them, which have not the gift of
continency, but be defiled through imbecilitie and weykenes. Of all this hole
place we have spoken sufficientelye heretofore. In which place forsooth it is
maruayle, sith so many perils and occasions of euylles be seen before our
iyes: that yet nevertheless our adversaries will defend their own traditions
against the open and manifest precepte of god. Neither do they pass any whyt
upon the saying of Christ, which rebukes the pharisaies for that they had
made traditions against the commandment of god. The.4 reason.
Fourthlye, wicked ceremonies and obseruaunces, to which they be bound, do
deliver them, which live in Monasteries, of their vow and profession. As (for
example) the abusing of the Mass, when it is for lucre applied for dead men,
honourynge of saints, in which is double sin, both because the saints be
substituted in to Christ's place, and be wickedly honored. (As for example the
freers of Dominikes order, have made a Rosary of the blessed virgin Marie,
which is nothing else but a long paterynge, I wot not wether more folyshe, or
more wicked, nouryshynge most vain trust.) And also because these self
impieties be only applied to the getti^g of money. Also the gospel of free
remission of sins for Christis sake, and of the justice of faith, of true
repentance, of the works, which god has commanded. All these things (I
say) they neither hear ne teach. But they busye them selves all together,
either in philosophical disputations, or in traditions of ceremonies, which
do obscure and mynyshe the honor of Christ. We will not here speak of all that
holle pomp of ceremonies, of redynges, of syngynges, and semblable things,
which might be suffered, if they were taken for exercises, so as lessons be
in the schools, the^de of which is to teach the hearers, and in teachi^g to
stir them to fear, or to faith. But now they feign, that these ceremonies
be honors and services of god, deseruynge forgyuenes of sins, both to them
selves, and to other also. For they for the same intent increase these
ceremonies. That if they did take these ceremonies upon them, to teach and
exhort the hearers: short and pyked lessons should do more good, than those
infinite and endless bablynges. So all the hole life of religious men is full of
hypocrisye, and of false opinions. Besides this there is another ieopardie, and
that is this, that they, which be in those Monasteries be compelled to assent
and agree unto them, which psecute the truth. There be therefore many wayghtie
and great reasons, which deliver good men from this kind of living.

The last reason.
Finally the very canons selves deliver many, which either entised by the
crafts of religious men have vowed religion without judgment, or else being
compelled by their friends have made their vows. Such manner vows not the
canones the^ selves do say to be vows* Of all these things it apperethe, that
there be many causes, which teach, that Monastical vows, such as have been
made hitherto, be no vows. Wherefore that kind of living may be safely enough
forsaken, which is full of hypocrysye and of false opinions.

Here they obiecte against us and bring out of the law the Nazareans.
Objections.
But the Nazareans took no vows upon them with these opinions, which we said
hitherto, The Nazareans.
that we reprove in the vows of religious men. The rite and custom of the
Nazareans was an exercise or protestation of their faith before men: it did
not merit remission of sins before god / it did not justify before god.

Again likewise as now circumcision, or sleynge of beasts in sacrifice,
should be none honor or service unto god: eue^ so the rite and custom of the
Nazarians ought not now to be set forth as an honor or service, but it
ought to be judged nothing else but an indifferent thing. The Monastical life
therefore, which without the word of god has been devised, to thentente that it
should be a service, wherewith to merit remission of sins and justification:
is not well compared and lykened to the custom of the Nazareans, which had for
it the word of god, and was not given to merit remission of sins, but to be
an exercise as the ceremonies of the law were? The same may be said of other
vows taught in the law.

There be alleged also the Rechabites, The Rechabites.
which neither had any possession, neither did drink any wine, as Hieremie
writes in the xxxv. chapitre. Then sample of the Rechabites agrees full
goodly (be ye sure) to our monks and freers, whose Monasteries pass in
sumptuousnes the palacies of kings, and which live most delicately and
voluptuously. But the Rechabites in that penury of all things were yet
married: Our religious men, when they have plenty of all manner delyces and
pleasures, do profess single life. But it were convenient and mete to
enterprete thexamples according to the rule (that is to wit) according to the
undoubted and evident scriptures, and not against the rule and scriptures. Now
this is most sure and undoubted, that our obseruau^ces merit not remission of
sins, or justification. Wherefore sithe it is so, that the Rechabites be
praised, it must needs be, that they did not therefore keep that manner and
custom, because they thought that by it they did merit remission of sins,
or that the work it self was a service or honor iustifienge, or for which
they should obtain everlasting life, and not by the mercy of god for the sede
that was promised: but because they had commandment of their parents:
therefore their obedience is commended, of which there is a commandment of
god, which says, Exo 20
Honor thy father and thy mother. Moreover the custom had a propre end of
it self, for it was used because they were strau^giers and alienes, and no
Israelites: and it appears that their fathers would have them dicerned by
certain special marks and tokens from their own country men, to thentente,
that they should not fall again to the impiety and wyckednes of their
country men. They would by these marks and signs put them in remembrance of
the doctrine of faith and of immortality. Such manner end or intent is
laufull. But the ends of cloister life be taught far after another sort.
They imagine, that the works of cloister life be services and honors to god,
they feign, that they merit remission of sins and justification. The example
therefore of the Rechabites is unlike monastical life, although that we leave
out here many other inco^modities and euylles, which be joined and incide^t to
this monkyshe life used now a days.

They allege also forth of the epistle to Timothe, Wydowes. 1. Ti. 5.
the place of wydowes, which doing service to the Church, had their living
of the comen cost and charge. There Paul says, They desire to be wedded,
having condemnation, because they have broken their first promise. First
let us imagyne that thapostle does speak here of vows: yet this place shall
not defend nor maynteyn Monastical vows, which be made of wicked ceremonies,
and that also with this wicked opinion, that they merit remission of sins,
and justification. For Paul with an hole voice does disallowe and condemn all
ceremonies, all laws, al works, if they be observed for such purpose, that
they should merit remission of sins, or that for them we might obtain
eternal life, and not for Christis sake through mercy. It ensues therefore
necessarily, yt the vows of wydowes, if there were any such at al, were far
unlike to our monastical vows. Besides this, if our adversaries will not
cease to wreste this place unto wydowes: Note this.
this part also of the text must be applied to vows, that Paul forbyddeth
a wydow to be chosen under three score years of age. So than vows made before
that age, shall be void and of no strength. But the church at that time knew
not these manner of vows. The true interpretation of Paul.
Therefore Paul rebukethe wydowes, not for that they would mary again, (For him
self byddethe young wydowes to be married) but because they being found of
the comen cost and charge, played the wantonness, and therefore did cast away
their first faith, and promise. He calls here the first faith not the
monastical vow, but the promise of christen life. And after the same fashyon
he takethe faith in the same chapitre, when he says, If any does not care
and provide for his own, namelye those of his own house, he has renyed the
faith. For he speaks otherwise of faith than do sophisters, he does not put
faith in them, which be in deadely sin. Therefore he says that they cast
away faith, which do not care for their kynsfolke. And according to the same
manner he says, that wanton wydowes do cast away their faith.

We have run over breuely a few reasons for our defense, and by the way we
have made answer to the objections of our adversaries. And these things we
have gathered together, not only for our adversaries cause: but much rather
for their sake, which have god lie and well disposed minds, to thentente that
they may have always in their syghte causes, why they ought to disprove and
myslyke the hipochrisie, and the feigned and cou^trefayte obseruaunces of abbey
life, which altogether, this one saying of Christ does defete, when he
says, They worship me in vain with the commandments and traditions of
men. Wherefore the vows the^ selves, and the obseruaunces of meats, of
redynge, of singing, of garments, of shoes, and of gyr^els, be unprofitable
services before god. And let all godly minds know this assured lie, that it
is a plain pharisaicall and a condemned opinion, that those obseruaunces
merit remission of sins / and that for them ^e be reputed ryghtuous / or
that for them we obteyn eternal life / and not through mercy for Christis
sake. For it is necessary that all the saints and holy men, which have lived
in these kinds of living, did cast away all trust of such manner
obseruaunces, and did learn, that they had remission of sins frelye for
Christis sake / and that for Christis sake through mercy they should obtain
eternal life / and not for these ceremonies or services, because god does
only approve the honors and services instituted by his own word, which be
strong and effectual in faith.

Of the power of the Church.
HEre our adversaries make a foul cryenge out and do brag stoutely of the
privileges and liberties of the church, and at last add this conclusion. All
things be vain, which in this present article be alleged against the
liberty of churches, and of priests. This is a false accusation, and a
starkelye. For we disputed of other matiers in this article. which god does
allow as justice, and to charge and lade consciences, so that it were sin to
leave them undone. All these things even one place in the Acts does teach,
where the apostles say, Acts. 15
that hertes be purified and made clean by faith. And afterward they
forbydde to lay on a yocke, and show how great ieoperdie it is, where they
make it a very grievous and heinous offense of them, which lade and ouercharge
the congregation. Why do ye tempte god, say they? But adversaries be nothing
aferd with this thunder and sore sentence, when they with violence defend
their own traditions and wicked opinions. For heretofore also they have
condemned our.xv. article, in which we did put, that traditions do not merit
remission of sins. And here they say, that traditions do help to eternal
life. Do they merit remission of sins? Be they services, which god does
allow as justices? Do they quicke^ the hertes? Paul in his epistle to the
Collossianes does therefore deny, Coll. 2.
that traditions be aduayllable or helpyng to eternal justice and eternal life:
because meat, drink, apparayle, and such other be things decayenge and
peryshynge with use and occupyenge. But eternal life in the heart, is wroughte
by eternal things (that is to wit) by the word of god, and the holy
ghost. Let our adversaries therefore declare, if they can, how traditions
help to eternal life. And for asmoche as the gospel does evidently witness,
that there ought not traditions to be laid upon the church, to merit
remission of sins, or to be services, which god does allow as justice, or
to charge consciences, so that it should be judged sin to leave them undone:
our adversaries shall never be able to prove, that bishops have power and
authority to institute such honors and services.

But what power the gospel does give to bishops we have showed in our
confession. They which de bishops now a days, do not execute the offices
of bishops according to the gospel: but they be bishops according to the
policy and ordenaunce in the canones / which we do not rebuke: But we speak of
a bishop according to the rule of the gospel. The old division of power.
And that old division of power / into power of order, and power of
jurisdiction, pleasith us very well. The bishop therefore has power of order,
that is the ministration of the word and of sacraments. He has also power of
jurisdiction (that is to say) authority to excommunicate those that have
committed open crimes / and again authority to assoile them if they will
convert and desire absolution. But neither have they tyrannical power (that is
to say) without any certain law / but they have a certain commandment, I
mean, the undoubted word of god, which they ought to teach / and according
to it to use their jurisdiction. Wherefore it folowith not, although they have
some jurisdiction, that they may institute new honors and services. For
ceremonies and services nothing apperteyne to jurisdiction. And they have a
word, and a commandment, how far forth they ought to exercise their
jurisdiction / which is, if any man have committed and trespassed against the
word, which they have received of Christ. Howbeit in our confession we have
added also, how far forth it is laufull for the^ to make traditions / that
is to wete, not as necessary services, but that there might be an order in the
church because of tranquillity. And these ought not to bind and entangle
consciences, as though they did command necessary honors and services / as
Paul teachith when he says. Gala. 5.
Stand fast in the liberty, in which Christ has delivered you / and be
not brought again under the yoke of bondage. The use therefore of such
ordinations ought to be left free (so that we avoid the offendyng of our
brethren) least they might else be judged to be necessary services. And so did
the apostles them selves / they ordained many things, which afterward in
process of time were changed. Neither did they in such wise ordeyne the
said traditions, yt it might not be laufull to change them. For they did not
disagre from their own writings, in which they labor very greatly that this
opinion should not oppress the church, that humayne rytes and ceremonies be
necessary services. This is the simple and plain manner of interpretynge
traditions (that is to wete) to know that they be no necessary services, and
yet that we observe and keep them, when we se opportunity, without
superstition to avoid the offe^dyng of our brethren. And this has been the
mind of many right conning and excellent men in the church. Neither we se
what can be brought against it. For this is undoubted, that the sentence of
Christ. Qui uos audit me audit. Luc. 10
that is to say. Whosoever hearith you hearith me / does not speak of
traditions / but it makes most against traditions. For it is no
commandment, but a wytnes given to the apostles, that we should give credence
to them of another man's word. For Christ would confirm and strength us
(as need was to do) that we should know, that the word taught by me^ was of
force and strength / and that we should not need to seek for any other word
from heaven, but it can not be vnderstonded of traditions. For Christ requirith
that they should so teach: that he might be herd / for he says (he hearith
me) He will therefore, that his word, and his voice be herd, and not human
traditions. So the saying that makith most for us, and conteynith most grave
consolation and doctrine: these Asses do wreste and apply to most trifelynge
things / I mean to the choice and diversity of meats, variety of clothyng,
and se^blable things. They allege also / these text. Obedite prepositis
uestris. Obey your rulers. This sentence requirith obedience toward the
gospel. Heb. 13.
For it does not establyshe a kingdom to the bysshoppes with out the gospel.
Neither ought bishops to make traditions against the gospel, or to interpret
their traditions against the gospel. For when they do so, we be forbidden to
obey them / according to that saying / if any man teach any other gospel:
accursed be he. Gal. 1.


The same answer we make to this saying of Christ, what soever they say: Ma.
23.
do it / because it is undoubted that it is not here universally commanded,
that we should receive al manner of things: Acts. 5.
for the scripture in another place does bydde us obey god more then me^.
Therefore when they teach wicked things, they be not to be herd. But so it is
that these be wicked teachynges that humayne traditions be honors and services
of god / and that they be necessary services / and merit remission of sins,
and eternal life. Ergo. etc^.

Another objection.
They obiecte also, and lay to our charge the open offendynge of people, and the
troubles and seditions which have risen under the pretense and cloak of our
doctrine. To these we answer briefly. First this is evidently known that
through the benefit of god our princes have obediente people in they^
lordshyppes and dominions. And this self same kind of doctrine, which we
follow, because it does with most large and high praise magnify the
authority of governors and rulers: does encreace reverence toward them.
This thing also is very profitable to retain and keep tranquillity.
Furthermore if al offe^sions were put together i^ one heap: yet these two
articles, that is to wete, that we freely receive remission of sins for
Christ's sake by faith / and that we be compted rightuous for Christ's sake by
faith, and not for our own fulfyllynge of the law. And again that
gouernaunces / laws and all the order of the common weal, be the ordenaunces
of god, which a christen man may use well and holyly: these two articles (I
say) have so much goodness in them, that they overcome al other inco^modities
and harms. For fearful consciences can have no sure co^solatio^ against the
wrath of god: onles they know the one article. And the other article does
greatly strengthen the tranquillity of commonweals. But with how detestable
and pestilente opinions both kinds of doctrine has been oppressed before these
time: every man knows / and the books of our adversaries testify, which no
where make any mention of faith, when they speak of remission of sins. They
teach in no place of the dignity of civil things. They in no place teach
how the gospel shows eternal justice and yet in the mean season in this
bodily life will that we use political or civil laws, manners and customs.
The declaration of these things did at the beginning purchase great favor to.
Martine Luther, not only among us, but also with many other me^, which now
be most extreme adversaries unto us. Thus as Pindarus says the old favor
perysheth and slepeth and the mortal men be vnrememberful. Now if any
troubles or seditio^s have been: the defalte may ryghtfully be laid on our
adversaries, which first raised (...) scisme and division / and scatered the
congregations in sundre by the wronful co^dempnation of Martine Luther, and
which now use marvelous cruelty against good men, and them that teach
godly doctrine. They stir up men's minds against us other manner ways also,
which I list not at this time to rehearse. Neither be we so hard hearted, and
so without sense or felyng, that the open offensions of people do nothing move
nor trouble our minds. But we remember that which Christ said. Blessed is
he, Ma. 15.
which shall not be offended in me. For the devil goes about partly to
oppress, The craft of the devil.
and partly to deforme the gospel and bring it out of fashyon by innumerable
means. In one place he kyndelyth tyrauntes against the teachers of the
gospel / in another place he raysith up wars / in another place se^itions /
in another place he styrreth up heresies: and all to make this kind of
doctrine hateful, which seems to give occasion to such sedicio^s and
strives. And wise men can a great deal more easily despise their own
ieoperdies, then they can those offensions of open seditio^s. But a christen
mind ought to be before armed against these things also to the end yt he do
not for the^ cast away the word of god. And although it delyteth not us to
make co^parisons, yet because our adversaries with these accusation do sore
press us with the hatred and evil will of the people: their vices and defaltes
may not be hid and passed over with silence / how much evil is there among
our adversaries in the profanation and abusing of Masses? How much fylthines
is in their abstaynyng from marriage? The worshyppyng of saints is full of
manifest and open ydolatrie. The ambition of the bishop of Rome.
Be none offendyd with the ambition of popes? Which now more tha^.CCCC. years
keep war with our Emperors, for the most part in Italy / and otherwhyles
also even in Germany it self, where they have set the father and the son
together by the ears / and kynsfolkes and citezens, one against another? That
if the causes of these wars be sought in histories: there shall nothing be
found semely ne condign for bysshoppes (for we will speak as moderatly as we
can). How great hurt and evil is there in this, that in making of prestes,
they do not chose out able and mete persons for that order? What also in the
byeng and sellyng of benefices? Also in daungerfull disputations, is there no
defalte at all? But these defaltes might somewhat be pardoned, if they had
retained the pure doctrine in the churches. Now how this doctrine is defiled
with wicked opinions and traditions, the writings of the canonistes, and the
books of divines do witness, which be full of profane disputations, which
partly be unprofitable to godly life, and partly also disagree from the
gospel. Furthermore in the expounyng of scripture, they do but play and devise
what soever they list. This confutation of doctrine is the chiefeste cause of
offense, and most peryllous, of which Saint John^ chiefly complaynethe in
his Apocalypse, Apo. 17
when he describes the kingdom of the pope. What when we shall come to the
superstition of religious persons, which be infinite: how many grievous
offensions be there? what applyenge is there of merits, if the dead body be
huryed in the habit of religion? Furthermore, is none occasion given unto men
to be offended: when now in these days they go about to oppress the
manifest truth of the gospel? when they cruellye kylle good men, which
teach true and godly doctrine? when they forbid that doubtful consciences
should be healed by having knowledge of the troth? when they exhort kings to
cruel robbery. No (god wot) these things be not to be judged occasions of
offe^sion, but pure, good, and the true offices of bishops.
