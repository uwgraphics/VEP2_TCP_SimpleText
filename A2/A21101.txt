TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL, AND MY MVCH respected good friend, Sir WILLIAM
OWEN, Knight, etc.
SIR:
ALL the Arts and Sciences which we know, and use at this day, are come to the
ripeness and flourishing in which they are, by the encouragement that Noble
Spirits have from time to time afforded unto such, as have by nature or
education been inclined to the special study and profession of them; It cannot
be denied, but there be too few (of rank and quality) which are pleased to
cast a loving, and a gracious eye upon Arts, and Artists, and love Arts for the
Arts themselves; yet the world, neither in this Kingdom, nor abroad, is as yet
so far degenerated, but it daily yeeldes some supply of such worthy persons
as are delighted in some liberal Science, or other; And whilst they please
themselves, grace, and confirm the good endeauours of others. In which number
your self (especially of your place and quality) are one of the chief, that
ever I knew, both for skill, and love of this poor, though divine Science,
whereof I am a Professor. Indeed this, and all other Arts have no enemies,
but such as know them not; such as know them, can no more choose but love them,
then their own eyes, or the light. But for your self, it is hard for me to
say, whether your skill in this Art, among many other, has made you love it so
much, or your love of it made you so skillful in it: Only this I am sure of,
that when I began to bethink with my self to whom to Dedicate these Songs, I
could find none, to whom they might come more welcome then your self; none
who was like to entertain them more willingly, could understand them better,
or make more true use of them. Yours therefore they shall be hereafter, they
shall call you Patron, and under your protection come abroad, if you will be
pleased (whereof I assure my self) to do him so much honor to accept of
them, which so much honors you, and will always rest at your command

Your devoted poor friend, MICHAEL EAST.
