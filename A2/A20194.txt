A plain exposition of the articles of our faith by short questions, and
answers for the understanding of the simple.
Q. WHat do the articles of our faith contain in general?

A. Two things.

Q. Which be they?

A. What have we to believe touching the Trinity, and what touching the Church.

Q. How many articles do concern the Trinity?

A. The first eight.

Q. How many do concern the Church?

A. The four last.

Q. Recite the articles of the faith?

A. I believe in God the father almighty, etc.

Q. Why do you say I believe, and not we believe?

A. Because every man must be saved by his own faith, and not by another man's.
Gal. 6.5.

Q. May not one man receive benefit by another man's faith.

A. Yes, in the things of this life, but not otherwise. Matthew. 8.13. Matthew. 9.2.

Q. How is this word believe to be understood?

A. Of a lively, and justifying faith. John. 12.46.

Q. What is your reason?

A. Because a dead faith cannot truly lay hold of those things which are to be
believed touching the father, son, and the holy Ghost. Iam. 2.16.

Q. What does this word God implie?

A. The Lord, the Lord strong, just, merciful, slow to anger, and abundant in
goodness, and truth, etc. as Exodus. 34.6. where the name of God is proclaimed.

Q. How many persons be there in the Godhead?

A. Three.

Q. Which be they?

A. The father, ye son, and the holy ghost.

Q. Are these three persons distinct in themselves?

A. Yea, as appears in these words: go baptize all nations in the name of
the father, the son, and the holy Ghost. Mat. 28. and again Matt. 3.6. Ioh.
14.26.

Q. May they not be confounded, as the father to be the son, and the son
the holy Ghost.

A. In no wise: for that has been the heresy of many.

Q. But tell me I pray thee, is the Godhead all one, and cannot be divided?

A. Yea truly: for the scripture says, there be three which bear record in
Heaven, the father, the word, and the holy Ghost, and these three are one. 1.
Ioh. 5.7.

Q. Tell me further, is every person by himself God?

A. Yea truly.

Q. Then it seems there should be three Gods?

A. Not so: but this is a mystery which in this life we cannot attain unto.

Q. But may it not be somewhat shadowed unto our senses?

A. Yes verily: for we see that a fountain of water, the filling up of it,
and the running out of it, although they be diverse things, yet indeed are all
one.

Q. Are all the persons in Trinity of equal greatness?

A. Yea.

Q. Is not the father greater than the son, nor the son greater than the
holy Ghost?

A. No, but they are all alike equal, alike eternal, alike essential. Math.
28.19.

Q. What does this word father note?

A. The first person in Trinity.

Q. Why is he called father?

A. In two respects, first in respect of his son Christ, which is his natural
and only begotten son: secondly in respect of us which are his children by
adoption and grace. Ioh. 1.14. Ephesians. 1.2. 1. Pe. 1.17.

Q. Why is God said to be almighty?

A. To distinguish him from the heathen gods which have no might. Iere. 10.11.
Psalm. 115.3. Cor. 8.5.

Q. Why else?

A. Because all things are governed by his providence. Act. 17.25, 28.

Q. Does Gods providence stretch to al things in Heaven, in earth, and the sea?

A. Yea, even to the sparrowes and hairs of our head. Matthew. 10.29.

Q. Does nothing come to pass by fortune or good luck?

A. Nothing truly.

Q. What say you then to these speeches, God send me good fortune; give me good
luck, and cast me into the sea?

A. They be profane, and heathenish speeches denying Gods providence.

Q. May a Christian reap any comfort of this, that all things come to pass by
Gods mere direction?

A. Very much truly, for when Gods hand is upon us by sickness, poverty,
slanders, or any other cross whatsoever of body or mind: it is a comfortable
meditation to think, this is not by chance or haphazard, but it is God our
heavenly fathers doing, and therefore that we fly to him by prayer, and seek
to be reconciled unto him by true, and unfeigned repentance. 2. Sa. 16.10.

Q. If al things come to pass by Gods providence, then is his providence also
in evil actions?

A. It is so, and what of that.

Q. If it be so, then God is the author of evil?

A. That follows not, for God is the author of ye actio^, but not of the evil
in ye actio^.

Q. What reason have you for that?

A. This: there be diverse workers even in evil actions, as God, the devil,
and wicked men, which he uses as his instruments. Now the evil of the actions,
is in the instruments, and not in God: for the actions of themselves as they
come from God are good, because he directs every thing to the praise of his
mercy, or his justice. Abac. 1.12. Exodus 9.6. To. 10.17. Act. 4.28.

Q. Show this yet more plainly by example?

A. The carrying of the children of Israel captive into Babilo^ was evil as
Nebuchadnezzar did it, for he respected nothing but the satisfying of his
malice against Gods people: but yet good as God did it, for he respected the
good of his people in humbling them under the cross for a time, and his own
glory in working out their deliverance.

Q. Let me have one plain example more to prove, that God and the devil work
together, in one and the self same action?

A. In the second book of Samuel and four and twenty chapter, it is said
that God moved David to number the people: but in the first book of the Chro.
cap. 21. it is said that satan provoked David to number them: so that here we
see God, and satan both together in one action, but yet to diverse ends, as has
been showed.

Q. Well now I am satisfied in this point, let us proceed and tell me what is
meant by this, that God made heaven and earth?

A. By Heaven and earth are understood all things in Heaven and earth. 2. Reg.
19.15. Act. 4.24.

Q. By whom, and in whom has God made Heaven and earth?

A. By and in his son Christ. John. 1.1. Heb. 1.1. Heb. 11.3. Col. 1.16.

Q. God having created al things, does he cease to govern the things which he
has once created?

A. No, for God rested the seventh day from creating but not from governing.
John 5.17.

Q. If God have created al things, then also he made the devils?

Q. God indeed created them, but yet not devils but Angels of light. Col. 1.16.

Q. How then became they devils?

A. By their fall.

Q. How prove you that they fell?

A. Out of the eight of John, when Christ says he aboade not in the truth:
therefore it follows he was in the truth.

Q. What other places have you to prove the fall of Angels?

A. S. Peter says that God spared not the Angels, that sinned, etc. 2. Pet.
2.4. and 5. Jude says the Angels which kept not the first estate, etc. and
Job says he found folly in his Angels. Job. 4.18.

Q. What was the cause of the fall of Angels?

A. We may not curiously search that, because it is not revealed.

Q. Did God make man also?

A. Yea.

Q. Whereof did he make him?

A. Of the dust of the earth. Genesis 2.7.

Q. Was his soul made of the dust of the earth?

A. No, for of his soul, it is said, God breathed in his face the breath of
life. Genesis. 2.7.

Q. It is said that God created man in his own likeness, how is that to be
understood?

A. Of the gifts, and qualities of the body, and mind, wherein he did
resemble God.

Q. Which be those qualities, and gifts?

A. Righteousness, and true holiness, perfect knowledge of God, in perfect both
understanding, and keeping of the law which was written in his heart. Col.
3.10. Ephesians. 4.24.

Q. How was this glorious image of God lost?

A. By the fall, and disobedience of our first parents.

Q. By what means did they fall?

A. The devil in the serpent beguiled the woman, and she entised the man, and
so they sinned. Gene. 3.

Q. What followed upon this?

A. The very floods of Gods wrath, and all misery brake in upon us all: sin
entered into the world, and together with sin came death, and the curse of GOD
upon all mankind. Romans 5.12.

Q. Now that ye have showed me how we were al lost, and by whom: show me also
how this loss is recovered, and by whom?

A. This loss is recovered through the infinite mercy of God, and that only by
the means of his son Christ. Romans 5.19. John. 3.16.

Q. Where is this showed?

A. In the six articles following.

Q. What do they generally teach?

A. How, and by what means Christ wrought out our redemption.

Q. What does this name Jesus signify?

A. A savior.

Q. Why was he so called?

A. Because he should save his people from their sins. Matthew. 1.21.

Q. What does this name Christ signify?

A. Anointed.

Q. Whereunto was he anointed?

A. To the three great offices of King, Priest, and Prophet. Esa. 61.1, 2. Luke
4.18.

Q. Were these three kind of persons wont to be anointed in old time?

A. Yea, as appears in the scriptures. 1. Sam. 10.1. 1. Reg. 1.39. Exodus
30.30. Leuit. 8.12. 1. Reg. 19.6.

Q. With what ointment were they anointed?

A. With material, and common ointme^t.

Q. What did the ointment signify?

A. The graces, and gifts of Gods spirit. John. 2.27.

Q. Why were Kings, Priests, and Prophets anointed, rather than any other sort
of men?

A. Because the weightinesse of their callings, did most of all require it.

Q. Was Christ anointed with material oil?

A. No, but with the oil of gladness, that is the graces, and gifts of Gods
spirit above his fellows. psa. 45.7. Io. 3.34.

Q. Why is Christ called a King?

A. Because he rules and governs his Church, as King and head thereof. Iere.
23.5. Ezech. 34.23. Hosea. 3.5.

Q. How does he govern his Church?

A. Outwardly by the scepter of his word and the external government therein
set down, and inwardly by his Spirit. Esa. 11.4. Psalm. 2.9. To. 12.7. 1.
Tim. 5.17. Luke 17.21. Romans 14.17.

A. Was his kingdom earthly?

Q. No, but altogether spiritual, for he says, my kingdom is not of this
world. Ioh. 18.36.

Q. To what end is he a king?

A. To deliver us from all our spiritual enemies, and to govern us in true
righteousness. Psalm. 72.2. Heb. 1.8.

Q. What profit have we by his being of a king?

A. Very much, for thereby we are made kings in him, we are enritched with
spiritual graces, and made free citizens with the saints, and of the household
of GOD. Apoc. 1.6. Ephe. 4.8. Ephe. 2.19.

Q. Was he also a priest?

A. Yea.

Q. After what order?

A. After the order of Melchizedech. Heb. 7.17.

Q. What was that?

A. Such, as wherein nothing was carnal, as in the priesthood of Leui: but all
things heavenly, and spiritual. He. 7.16.

Q. What manner of sacrifice did he offer?

A. Not the blood of bulls, and goats but his own blood. Heb. 9.12.

Q. How did he offer himself and his own blood?

A. Through the eternal spirit that is his Godhead, for otherwise he could
not have obtained eternal redemption for us. Heb. 9.4.

Q. Can none offer his body, and blood but himself?

A None truly: for the Scripture uses these phrases very much, he offered
himself, he gave himself. Heb. 1.3. 1. Tim. 2.6. Heb. 9.26.

Q. Is his sacrifice once offered sufficient for all, yesterdaie, to day, and
for ever.

A. Yea undoubtedly, for the scriptures have this word once, very often, and
again with one sacrifice has he consecrated for ever them that are
sanctified. Heb. 26. Heb. 7.27. Heb. 10.4.

Q. May it not be repeated?

A. In no wise, for that is blasphemy, it accuses Christ his death of
imperfection: it encrocheth upon his right; it spoyleth him of his office. Heb.
9.26. He. 10.18.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. Because it is omnisufficient, and as the holy Ghost says; after he had
offered one sacrifice for sins, he sits for ever at the right hand of God.
Heb. 10.12. Heb. 7.25.

Q. What else?

A. Because the Priesthood of Christ is eternal: and as all the Leuitical
Priests and Priesthood, and shadowish service of the tabernacle, did aim and
point at him: so all that is ended in him, together with all other Priests and
Priesthood. Heb. 7.24. Heb. 8.5. Heb. 9.8, 9. Heb. 7.18.12.

Q. To what end did this great priest offer up this great sacrifice?

A. To purge our consciences from dead works, to serve the living GOD. Heb.
9.14.

Q. What profit have we by this Priesthood and sacrifice of Christ?

A. Exceeding great: for thereby we are reconciled unto God, have free access
to the throne of grace, and are made Priests in him. Romans 5.10. Romans 5.2. 1.
Pet. 2.5.

Q. Let us proceed, was he also a Prophet?

A. Yea, even that great Prophet, which Moses forespoke of. Deuteronomy. 18.15. Act.
3.22.

Q. Why is he said to be a Prophet?

A. Because he has fully declared unto us the will of his father. John. 1.18.
John. 15.15.

Q. Wherein did the office of the Prophets consist in old time?

A. In four things especially.

Q. Which be they?

A. First, in expounding the law. Hos. 6.6. Micah. 6.8.

Secondly, in preaching the covenant of grace. Iere. 31.31. Nahum. 1.15.

Thirdly, in denouncing Gods wrath against the rebellious people. Mal. 4.1.
Zeph. 3.1.

Fourthly, in foretelling things to come. Esa. 7.8. Zach. 14.4, 20.

Q. Has Christ answered to al these?

A. Yea.

Q. Show where?

He has expounded the law most sincerely. Matthew. 5.28.

He has preached the covenant of grace. Matthew. 11.28.

He has threatened the judgments against the wicked. Matthew. 23.33.

He has foretold of things to come. Matthew. 24.2.29.

Q. Let us go forward, why is Christ said to be a Lord?

A. Because he has dominion over men and Angels. Ephe. 1.21. Phil. 2.9.

Q. Do you believe that Christ was conceived by the holy Ghost?

A. Yea, most constantly.

Q. What proof have you for it?

A. The first of Luke where it is written, that the holy Ghost should come upon
the virgin Mary, and the power of the most high should ouershaddow her, and so
she should conceive, and bear a child.

Q. Was it of necessity that he should be conceived by the holy Ghost?

A. Yea, for if he had been conceived after the common course of nature, then
he should have been conceived, and borne in sin, because the seed of man was
wholly defiled in Adam. Psalm. 51.5. Ioh. 3.6.

Q. And what then?

A. Then he could not have saved us being himself sinful, for he should
have needed a savior for himself. Heb. 7.26.

Q. What other reason have you to show that Christ must needs be without
sin?

A. Because otherwise the most glorious Godhead could not be coupled with
sinful flesh to make one person. Col. 1.19. Col. 2.9.

Q. Was this perfect holiness of Christ shadowed in the law?

A. Yea, by the paschall lamb, which therefore must be without blemish; by
the Passover Bread, which might not be sowred with any leaven, and by all the
sacrifices, which must be of clean, and sound beasts. Exodus. 12.5.15.
Leuit. 4, 28. Mal. 1.8.

Q. What good have we by this?

A. Hereby we are assured, that our mediator is perfectly able to save all
those which come unto him. And again that the same spirit which sanctified the
conception of the virgin, is able also to sanctify our mortal bodies. Heb.
7.25.

Q. Tell me further, do you believe that Christ was borne of the virgin Mary?

A. I do.

Q. What reason is there that he should be borne of a virgin?

A. This, that the scriptures did so foretell. Esa. 7.14.

Q. Are you persuaded that he took very flesh of the virgin?

A. Yea, for the scripture says he was made flesh, and that his body was of
flesh. John. 1.14. Col. 1.22.

Q. Some have held that his body was of the air: others that it was an
imaginary body, and some again that he took no flesh of the virgin, but
passed through her as water through a condiut pipe?

A. True, but the holy Ghost says, he was made of the seed of David, and he
was made of a woman. To. 1.3. Gal. 4.4.

Q. Then you are persuaded that he had the very powers of a human body, the
actions, and the senses?

A. I am so.

Q. And are you likewise persuaded that he had the infirmities of the same, as
weariness, hunger, thirst, etc?

A. Yea also, for the scriptures says it. John. 4.6. Matthew. 4.2. John. 19.28.

Q. Do you also believe that he had a very human soul, with the powers
thereof, as will, reason, affections?

A. I do so believe.

Q. And are you persuaded that he had the infirmities of a human soul?

A. Yea, for it is written, he increased in wisdom, and again not my will,
but thy will be done. Luke. 2.52. Matthew. 26.39.

Q. Well, I see that you are strongly persuaded of the manhood of Christ, are
you not likewise also persuaded of his Godhead?

A. Yea altogether as much, for the word was God. Ioh. 1.1.

Q. Was he then both GOD and man?

A. He was both. Zach. 13.7.

Q. Was he then two Christ's, or two persons?

A. No, but the two natures of God, and man were knit together in one person
Christ. Esa. 7.14.

Q. Show this more plainly?

A. Even as the soul and body of man, although they be of diverse natures,
yet make but one person: so the nature of God, and of man, although they be
diverse; make but one Christ.

Q. Was then the Godhead turned into the manhood, or the manhood into the
Godhead?

A. Neither, but both did retain their several properties without any
confusion.

Q. Whether was he our mediator as he was man, or as he was God?

A. Neither as he was man alone, nor as he was GOD alone, but as he was
Christ, that is both GOD and man. 1. Tim. 2.5.

Q. Was it then necessary that he should be both God and man?

A. Yea, altogether.

Q. Why was it necessary that he should be God?

A. Because otherwise he had not been able to save us. Heb. 7.25, 26.

Q. Why was it necessary that he should be man?

A. Because it was the will of GOD, that that which was lost in the nature of
man should be recovered in the nature of man. Genesis. 3.15. Hebrews. 2.16.

Q. What other reason have you?

A. Because otherwise we could have no access to the father. Ioh. 14.6.

Q. Well, let us go on: what was Pontius Pilate?

A. An heathen judge, the governor of Judea.

Q. Why is there mention made of him?

A. To show that the Jews were now subject to a foreign power, according to
old Jacobs prophecy. Genesis 49.10.

Q. Did Pilate give sentence of condemnation against Christ?

A. Yea, as appears. Luke 23.24.

Q. But he seemed often to clear him, and to pronounce him innocent, as when
he washed his hands before the multitude, saying, I am innocent of the blood
of this just man, look you to it. Matthew. 27.24.

A. True, but therein he played the hipocrit. But in very deed, it was the
providence of the father, to avouch the innocence of his son, that he should
justify him which did condemn him.

Q. Was the sentence of Pilate ratified by God?

A. Yea, and the outward condemnation of Christ before Pontius Pilate, was a
pattern of his condemnation before his father withal our sins upon him.
Act. 4.28.

Q. What did Christ suffer under Pontius Pilate?

A. The curse of God, the wrath of his father, all torments due unto our
sins. 1. Pet. 2.24. Gal. 3.13. Esa. 53.5.

Q. If he suffered all torments due unto our sins, then he suffered eternal
condemnation?

A. What of that.

Q. Why, was he not then finally condemned for ever?

A. Because he was God, and therefore could not be overcome of death: nor the
devil. Heb. 2.14. 1. Cor. 15.55.

Q. Why was Christ content thus to be condemned before Pontius Pilate as an
open malefactor?

A. That he might clear us before the judgment seat of his father. 2. Cor.
5.2. Esa. 53.8.

Q. Did our Lord Jesus suffer willingly that which he suffered?

A. Yea: for he says, I lay down my life of my self, that I might take it
again. John. 10.17.

Q. What does the word crusifie signify?

A. A nailing to the cross, because Christ was fastened with nails through
the hands and feet, to a cross piece of wood.

Q, Was that a more shameful kind of death than any other?

A. Yea, amongst the Jews it was counted most odious, and reproachful. Deuteronomy.
21.23. Phil. 2.8.

Q. What do you believe, touching this that he was dead?

A. I do believe that he was wracked and tormented unto death, and until the
kall of his heart burst, and he gave up the Ghost Ihon. 19.30.

Q. What did follow Christ's giving up the Ghost?

A. Very fearful things, for the veil of the temple rent, the earth did
quake, the stones did cleave, the graves did open, the bodies of the saints
did arise and appear to many. Mat. 27.51.

Q. And what more?

A. The Centurion and others were constrained to confess him to be a just
man, and the Son of GOD. Luke 23.47. Matthew. 27.54.

Q. Do you believe, that Christ was laid in a grave, and buried?

A. Yea: for the Scripture says, he was laid in a new sepulcher, wherein
never man was laid before. John 19.41.

Q. By whom was he buried?

A. By two worthy persons, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea. John. 19.38, 39.

Q. Why was he buried?

A. For the greater certainty of the matter: for otherwise they might have
said after his resurrection, that his body was never laid in the grave.

Q. What is the meaning of this, that he descended into hell?

A. That he suffered, not only in his body, but also in his soul, all
punishments due to our souls. Esaias 53.10, 11. Mar. 14.33, 34.

Q. Where did he suffer these torments?

A. Upon the Cross: for the Scripture says, all was dispatched and done upon
the cross. Col. 2.14, 15. Col. 1.20.

Q. When did he suffer these horrors, of death and condemnation?

A. Before his death in the garden Gethsemane. Matthew. 26.36.

Q. What signs were there of his suffering, condemnation, and the very
hellish torments in his soul?

A. His strong cries, and tears unto his father, his sweating as it were drops
of blood, his praying that if it were possible the cup might pass. Heb. 5.7.
Luke. 22.44. Matthew. 26.39.

Q. Was it not for fear of bodily death that our Lord Jesus did thus cry out?

A. No, for it were against all reason to think that the son of God could be
so shaken with any fear of natural death.

Q. What was it then?

A. Surely (as has been said before) it was the intolerable wrath of his
father, and the unspeakable torments of condemnation due to our sins, which
caused him, which had al fullness and perfection of faith, to cry out as a man
condemned and forsaken.

Q. You said even now that he suffered al upon the cross, did he then suffer
nothing after his death?

A. Nothing truly.

Q. How prove you that?

A. Because he said before he gave up the Ghost that all was finished;
meaning the work of our redemption, and to what end then should he suffer any
more. John. 19.30.

Q. Did not his soul go down to the place of the damned?

A. No, for his soul went to Paradise, but Paradise is not the place of the
damned, therefore his soul came not there. Luke 23.43.

Q. Yea, but this word of Descending, does seem to importe that he went
down some whether after his death?

A. The word of desending does not imploye any mutation of place in body, or
soul, but of state and condition. Ioh. 3.13.

Q. It may be further objected, that this word hell, does note the place of the
damned; therefore Christ's soul was in hell?

A. The word hell, does not always in the Scripture note the place of the
damned, but sometimes the grave, and sometimes extremity of afflictions. Genesis
42.38. Psalm. 6.5. Psalm. 86.13. Ion. 2.2.

Q. Well, but Saint Peter says, that Christ in his spirit, went and preached
to the spirits that are in prison, therefore Christ's soul was in hell among
the damned. 1. Pet. 3.19.

A. Saint Peter in that place does not mean by the word spirit, his humane
soul, but his Godhead.

Q. What reason can you allege for that?

A. This: Christ went and preached in the same spirit, wherein he was raised up
from the dead: but he was not raised up from the dead by the power of his
humane soul, but by the power of his Godhead, therefore he went and preached,
not in his humane soul, but in the power of his Godhead.

Q. How prove you that he went and preached to the spirits in prison, in the
same spirit wherein he was raised up?

A. The very text says that he was put to death as concerning the flesh, but
was quickened or raised up in the spirit, by the which spirit he went and
preached, etc. 1. Pet. 3.19.

Q. I pray you then tell me, what is the meaning of Saint Peter in that place?

A. Saint Peter's meaning is this, that Christ by the power of his Godhead, and
divine spirit in Noah, and not in his own humane flesh, did preach to the old
world, who would neither hear nor obey the warning of Noah, and therefore are
now in hell fire because of their disobedience.

Q. You say well: but I have not yet done. For it is written in the sixteenth
Psalm; Thou will not leave my soul in hell, etc. Therefore Christ's soul was
in hell.

A. The Holy Ghost himself by the mouth of his Apostles Peter and Paul,
does expound that place, as a prophecy of the resurrection of Christ. Acts.
2.31. Act* 13.37.

A. How then must the words be interprered?

A. Thus thou will not leave my soul, that is my dead body in hell, that is
in the grave, for so it should be translated.

Q. Where do you read in the scriptures that the word soul, is put for a
dead body?

A. In the second of Leuiticus, and very often in the scriptures it is put for
the body, and the whole person. Joshua. 10.30. 1. Pet. 3.20.

Q. Some hold that Christ went down after his death to Lembus Patrum (that is
as they say the brimme of hell) to fetch our fathers from thence, and I pray you
what say you to that?

A. I say they err, not knowing the scriptures.

Q. Why?

A. For there is no such place, neither were our forefathers ever in any such
place, and therefore how could Christ fetch them out, where they never were.

Q. How prove you that our forefathers were never in any such place?

A. Because they were saved by the ^romised seed, as we are. Ihon. 8.56. Heb. ^
15.

Q. How could they be saved by Christ, before he suffered?

A. Because the saving power of his death was from the beginning. Heb 13.8. 1.
Pet. 1.20. Apoc. 13.8.

Q. Now tell me one thing further, whether did Christ suffer these foresaid
torments in his Godhead, or in his manhood?

A. In his manhood: for his Godhead could not suffer, but did as it were hide
it self in the time of his suffering. Phi. 2.7.

Q. How then was he our mediator, according to both natures?

A. Yes very well notwithstanding, for he was God, not to suffer, but to
overcome by suffering: which was a part of his mediation.

Q. What profit have we by the death, and sufferings of Christ?

A. Exceeding much.

Q. Show wherein?

A. First, thereby our sins are forgiven. 1. Ihon. 1.7.

Secondly, he has set all at peace in heaven and earth. Col. 1.20.

Thirdly, he has taken away the sting of death. 1. Cor. 15.55.

Lastly, he makes sin die in our mortal bodies. Romans 6.4.

Q. Now that you have showed me the sufferings of Christ: and the profit we
have by them: tell me further what became of him after he was dead and buried?

A. He rose again the third day.

Q. Are you persuaded that he did arise again?

A. Yea, according to the scriptures.

Q. What Scripture have you for that?

A. The 15. chapter of the first epistle to the Cor. where it is written that
Christ rose again according to the scriptures.

Q. Was he seen after his resurrection?

A. Yea.

Q. Of whom?

A. Of Cephas, of James, of Paul, of Marie, of the two disciples, of the
twelve, of all the Apostles: of more then five hundred brethren at once. 1.
Cor. 15.5. John. 20.18. Luke 24.34.

Q. How could he possibly rise again, seeing the sepulcher was watched, and
the stone sealed. Mat. 27.66.

A. Because he was God. Romans 1.4.

Q. What learn we out of this?

A. That neither death, hell, the grave, nor corruption, could seize upon him.

Q. What more?

A. That he has fully satisfied for all our sins: for if there had been
but one sin unpaid for, it would have held him down still in the grave. 1.
Cor. 15.17.

Q. What profit have we by the resurrection of Christ?

A. First, thereby we are justified. To. 4.25.

Secondly, we are assured that our bodies shall rise again. Romans 8.11.

Thirdly, thereby we are raised up to newness of life. Rom 6.4.

Q. What followed his resurrection?

A. His ascension into Heaven.

Q. Did he ascend into Heaven immediately after his resurrection?

A. No, he stayed forty days upon the earth. Acts. 1.3.

Q. What did he those forty days?

A. He presented himself alive to his disciples, he had conference with them,
he instructed them, he armed and prepared them against the time of trial.
Acts. 1.2, 3.

Q. How was he taken up?

A. In a Cloud, after a visible manner, in his human body, his disciples
looking steadfastly after him. Acts. 1.9.10.

Q. Was it necessary that our Lord Jesus should thus ascend into Heaven?

A. It was very meet and necessary, that after all his sorrows and
sufferings, he should possess his chair of estate.

Q. Had it not been better that he had tarried still with us upon the earth?

A. No: for that would destroy our faith, our spiritual love, and al our hope.
2. Cor. 5.16. Heb. 11.1. 2. Cor. 5.7. 1. Pet. 1.8.

Q. Is Christ so ascended, that he is no more with us upon the earth?

A. No: for although he be absent from us, as touching his bodily presence:
yet is he with us in the power of his spirit. Math. 28.20.

Q. What profit have we by the ascension of Christ?

A. First, thereby he has set open the gates of heaven, and made an open
entrance to all that will come in. Ep. 2.13. He. 10.19

Secondly, he makes continual intercession for us. Heb. 7.25.

Thirdly, he being ascended, will draw all us his members unto him. Iho. 12.32.

Fourthly, because our head is above the water: therefore although we may be
foundred, yet can we not be stifled. 2. C^r. 4.8.9. 2 Cor. 6.9.

Q. What is meant by this, sitting at the right hand of his Father?

A. That he is exalted far above the Angels, and all creatures whatsoever.
Ephesians. 1.20. Phil. 2.9. Mark. 16.18.

Q. Has God a right hand of flesh and blood like a man?

A. No: for God is like no creature. Esa. 40.18. Acts. 17.29.

Q. How then?

A. It is a borrowed speech taken from kings, who are accustomed to set them on
their right hand whom they will highly advance. 1. Reg. 2.19. Psalm. 45.9.

Q. But the scripture speaks of Gods head, eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and
feet: as if he were a man?

A. That is for the weakness of our understanding, and not because he has any
such members indeed.

Q Show this more fully?

A. We cannot understand heavenly things in their proper nature and being, but
as they are made plain unto us by earthly simil^^udes.

Q. What may we learn out of this so high exaltation of our Lord Jesus?

A. That as he is able to vanquish al his enemies, so also he is able to help
his friends

Q. How long shall Christ sit at the right hand of his father?

A. Until the consu^mation of al things Acts. 3.21.

Q. will he the^ come again in the end of the world?

A. Yea, and that in visible sort, as he ascended. Acts. 1.11. 2 Thessalonians. 1.7.

Q. Will he come poorly and basely as in his first coming?

A. No, but after a most glorious, wonderful, and dreadful manner.

Q. How is that?

A. In the clouds of heaven with a shoute, with the voice of the Archangell, with
the sound of the last trumpet: in flaming fire, with ten thousand thousands
of Angels. 1. Th. 4.16. 2. The. 1.7. Dan. 7.10.

Q. When shall he come?

A. Of that day and hour knows no man, but the scripture says it is at
hand. Mat. 24.36. Heb. 10.37. 1. Pet. 4.7.

Q. Will he give no warning of his coming?

A. He will come very suddeinly as a thief in the night, and as the travail
of a woman. 2 Pet. 3.10. 1. Th. 5.3. Luke 21.25

Q. What will he do when he comes?

A. He will judge both the quick and dead.

Q what is meant by the quick and the dead?

A. Al yt ever have bin, are, and shall be to the end of the world, as well those
yt are dead and rotten in the earth, as those which shall be found alive at his
coming. Ap. 20.12.

Q Shall not the rich, mighty, and great Potentates of the earth be dispensed
with, and exempted from this judgment.

A. No, but all must make their personal appeerance. 2. Cor. 5.10.

Q How shall we be judged?

A. By the word of god: the books of our consciences shall be opened, and
every man shall receive according to his works. John. 12.48. Daniel. 7.10.
Apoc. 20.12. 2. Cor. 5.10.

Q. Will not learning, wit, policy, speech, friendship, flattery, riches,
strength; beauty, gold nor silver help in that day?

A. All these will avail nothing: for he will judge the world with
righteousness, and the people with equity. Psalm. 96.13.

Q. What learn we out of this, that Christ shall be our judge?

A. First, we learn to our comfort, that he shall be our judge, which is
our mediator.

Secondly, that in the mean time we live an holy and godly life, in fear,
and trembling, as those which look for that great day of appearing. 2. Peter.
3.11. Tit. 2.13.

Q. Now that you have showed me your faith in the Son: it remains that you
tell me also, what you believe concerning the holy Ghost?

A. I believe the holy Ghost to be God, coequall, coeternall, and coessentiall
with the Father and the Son.

Q. Where do you find in the scriptures that the holy Ghost is God?

A. In the first of the Acts he is called God: and many other places do
ascribe unto him those things which belong unto none but God. 1. Cor. 2.10. 1.
Cor. 12.11. Act. 13.2. Matthew. 12.31.

Q. Why is the holy Ghost distinguished from the Father and the Son, by this
adiunct holy, and why is he thus called?

A. Not in respect of himself, whose Godhead is no more holy than the father,
and the son: but in respect of his operation and work, which he works in us.

Q. Which be the special works of the holy Ghost in the hearts of the elect,
whereby he makes them holy?

A. He works in them all holy and heavenly affections. Ephe. 5.18.

He seals the benefits of Christ's death to their souls. Ephe. 4.30.

He opens their hearts to believe the Gospel. Act. 16.14.

He certifieth them of their election. Rom 8.16.

He leads them into all truth. John. 16.13.

He teaches them to pray. Roman. 8.16.

Q. Let us now come to the second part of the Creed which concerns the
Church: and first tell me what is it which ye call the Church?

A. The whole company of those which GOD has appointed unto salvation.

Q. What does this word Catholic signify?

A. Universal, or that which goes through the whole.

Q. Why is the Church so called?

A. Because it contains all the godly that ever were, are, or shall be, of
what place, language, or condition so ever.

Q. Is the Church always visible?

A. No* the Church is sometimes hid as the Moon under a cloud, as it was in
the days of Elias. 1. Reg. 19.10. Apoc. 12.6.

Q. Does it not follow then that there is no Church at all?

A. No more, than if a man should conclude there is no Moon in the Heavens,
because sometimes there is none seen.

Q. Wherefore do you call it the holy Church?

A. Because all the members thereof are holy.

Q. Can none of the wicked, and unholy, be of the Church?

A. No: for he that has not the Spirit of Christ is none of his. Romans. 8.9.

Q. Many persuade themselves to be of the Church, who notwithstanding mock at
holiness?

A. Such do plainly show that they believe not the holy but the unholy Church.

Q. Shall none be saved but those which be of the Church?

A. None verily: for as a vine branch cannot live except it abide in the vine:
no more can we, except we abide in Christ, and be of his Church. John. 15.4.

Q. What other reason have you to prove this by?

A. Because none have any interest in the benefits of Christ's death, but only
the Church. Ephe. 5.25.

Q. Are all that are in the Church, of the Church?

A. No: for there be many hipocrites in the church, which be not of the
church. Matthew. 10.36. Act. 20.30.

Q. Let us proceed, what is meant by the communion of Saints?

A. The holy fellowship of the faithful.

Q. What does this word Communion signify?

A. A knitting together in one.

Q. How are the faithful knit together in one?

A. In two respects.

Q. Which be they?

A. First in respect of Christ their head. Secondly, in respect one of another.
To. 12.5. Ephe. 4.16.

Q. Do you believe that the faithful are so linked together, that they are of
one mind, of one heart, and of one soul?

A. Yea, for so says the Scriptures. Acts. 4.32.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. Because they are all lead with one spirit, they are children to one
Father, servant to one master, soldiers under one captain, etc. Ephesians. 4.4.

Q. It is much objected by profane men, that there is no love now a days,
there was never so little love as now.

A. Amongst profane Atheists and worldlings, there was never any true love,
nor ever will be: but amongst the people of God there has always been true
Love, and ever will be, Apocalips. 14.2.

Q. Is there any love betwixt the wicked and the godly?

A. No: for the one is an abomination to the other, and what fellowship has
light with darkness. Proverbs. 29.27. 2. Cor. 6.14. Genesis 25.22. Gal. 4.29.

Q. Do the godly hate the wicked, as they are hated of them?

A. No: for the godly hate not the persons of the wicked, but their sins: but
the wicked hate them with a deadly hatred. Acts. 7.60. Prouer. 29.10. 2. Chro.
18.7.

Q. Do the godly love one another whom they have never seen?

A. Yea, and therefore it is put within the compass of things which are to be
believed.

Q. Wherein does this holy fellowship of the faithful consist?

A. In this, that they have all things common. Act. 2.44.

Q. How understand you that, have none any property in their own?

A. Yes, but amongst them things are common in use, though not in possession.
Acts. 4.32. Acts. 5.4.

Q. Express your meaning more plainly in this point?

A. My meaning is, that all the faithful hold themselves bound before God to
employ whatsoever gifts of body or mind the Lord has endued them withal, to
the mutual benefit and comfort one of another.

Q. Is this a certain token that we are of God, when we love his children,
and are nearly knit unto them in our hearts?

A. It is an infallible proof that we are of God, when our hearts are knit
unto this holy communion of saints. 1. Ioh. 3.14.

Q. Is it not also true in the contrary, that they are not of God which hate
his people, and their holy society?

A. Yes verily, for it is the spirit of satan that enuieth the spirit of God,
in his elect.

Q. What is meant by Saints?

A. All the faithful both in heaven and earth.

Q. Be there any Saints in the earth?

A. Yea, for David says, all my delight is in the Saints, that are on the
earth. Psalm. 16.2.

Q. What say you to our mocksaints, which scornefully say these men be Saints
they be all of the spirit, they know their seat in heaven?

A. I say they be scoffing Ishmaelites.

Q. Why, must we live like Saints in this world?

A. Yea, or else we must burn like devils in hell fire after this world.

Q. But we cannot live as Christ did.

A. True: but yet we must endeavor to be holy as he is holy. Matthew. 5.48. 1.
Pet. 1.15.

Q. Let us come to the next Article: Do you believe the forgiveness of sins.

A. Yea undoubtedly.

Q. By whom have we forgiveness of our sins?

A. Only by Christ.

Q. Is there no other name in heaven, nor earth, whereby we may purchase
remission of sins?

A. None at all. Act. 4.12.

Q. Are we not able to satisfy for our sins.

A. No: none is able. Luke 17.10.

Q. But is not satisfying flat contrary to our faith in the free forgiveness of
our sins?

A. Yes altogether.

Q. Shall all men have forgiveness of their sins by Christ?

A. No: but those only which are of the Church, and therefore this Article is
joined to the former.

Q. May a Christian be fully persuaded of the forgiveness of his sins in
this life?

A. Yea, or else he does not believe: for faith carries home a persuasion into
the soul. Col. 2.2.

Q. Then belike a Christian may be assured of his salvation in this life?

A. What else, he that knows not in this life that he shall be saved: shall
never be saved after this life. 1. Ihon. 3.2.

Q. Nay, but we must think well: and hope well in Gods mercy: but we cannot be
assured till we be in Heaven?

A. I say again, that faith is no thinking: nor vain hoping; but a full
persuasion. Heb. 11.1.

Q. Show this more plainly?

A. There it nothing lets us from salvation but our sins: now then if we
believe that our sins are forgiven, what is there that should hinder us, why
we should not be persuaded.

Q. What do you believe concerning the resurrection of the body?

A. That as verily as Christ our head is risen from death, so shall our bodies
gloriously rise again in the end of the world. Romans 8.11.

Q. How is it possible that the bodies of such as died many hundred years
ago, and are consumed to nothing should ever rise again?

A. There is nothing impossible with God: it is as easy for him to raise the
dead bodies out of the dust, as it was to create all things of nothing.

Q. Shall these same bodies of ours arise again?

A. Yea, the same in substance: but changed in qualities, for this corruptible,
must put on incorruption. 1. Cor. 15.53. Phil. 2.21.

Q. Do ye the^ believe that every one shall stand up with the same bones and
flesh which he lived in here, or shall God give new bodies?

A. It shall be the very same flesh, and the same bones, otherwise how should
we be said to rise again. Job 19.27.

Q. What is the reason hereof?

A. Because it does not stand with gods justice to make new bodies: which never
had done good, or evil: either to reward them, or to punish them.

Q. What do you conclude then?

A. That the very same flesh which has sinned, shall be cast into hell: and
the same flesh which has glorified GOD in this life, shall be glorified of him
for ever.

Q. What shall then follow after this resurrection?

A. Our bodies and souls being most gloriously joined again together: we
shall reign for ever with our Christ in the unspeakable joys of Heaven.

Q. What learn we out of this?

A. First, to long after it as our home.

Secondly, to study to please GOD in the mean while.

Thirdly, with patience and courage to go thorough stitch with all afflictions
and troubles, which are incident to the profession of the Gospel, knowing in
our selves: that there is an infinite recompense of reward laid up for us in
the heavens.
