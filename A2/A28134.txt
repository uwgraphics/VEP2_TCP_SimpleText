A WARNING FROM THE Lord God of LIFE and Power, UNTO THEE O CITY OF LONDON, AND
TO The SUBURBS round about thee:

To call thee and them to repentance and amendment of life, without which you
cannot see God.

Be ye separated from your Priests, and from your Idolatrous Worship, and touch
not the unclean thing, that the Lord may receive you; Written by one who
follows the Lamb, and desires the welfare of all Souls, as I was moved
thereunto by the Eternal and true Spirit of God, being quiet and still in my
habitation.

And something also to the scattered Seed of God, which has been held in
bondage under Pharaoh the Task-master.

Who am hated by the unwise, and foolish in heart, and am reproachfully called
a QUAKER.

ESTER BIDDLE.

LONDON, Printed for Robert Wilson, at the Black-Spread-Eagle and Windmill in
Martins, near Aldersgate, 1660.

A Warning unto the City of London, and the Suburbs round about, etc.
O The day and hour of thy Visitation is now, O City of London! with all thy
Suburbs, and likewise the day, hour, and time of Gods righteous Judgments is
at hand, and will be executed upon thee in flames of fire from heaven: O my
soul mourns for thee, and my bowels is troubled, and my heart is pained
within me, to see thy desolation, my eyes runs down as a Fountain for the
misery that is overtaking thee: O the fury of the Lord! it is terrible, and who
may stand, when it waxes hot, and burns as a flaming fire: O repent, repent,
repent! for thy wickedness surmounteth the wickedness of Sodom and Gomorrah,
thy pride and ambition far exceeds Jerusalems: Jerusalem had one Temple to
worship in, and it was commanded of the Lord to be built, and the Lord
commanded them to worship in it; but according to your imaginations, so is your
worship, and as your streets are, so are your Idols Temples, and thy Idolatrous
Worship; the abomination of desolation, sits where it ought not, and the
Seed that belongs to Immortal Life, is buried in thee! O London, London! how
art thou fallen? and from whom art thou gone astray? even from the righteous
Judge, and pure God of heaven, and of earth, O! thou art dead, and dying from
the true worship and service of the Lord, which is in Spirit and in truth; thou
art groaping at noonday, and thy light is not risen out of obscurity, that
should give thee the knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Jesus Christ,
although the measure of Gods grace has called thee to repentance, and does
strive with thee against thy pride, cruelty, hard-heartedness, and oppression,
but thou will not lend thine ear unto it, neither does the grace of God teach
thee; but to the contrary art thou led unto persecution, by that spirit which
leads into transgression: O! how many of the Lords dear servants, Lambs and
Babes, has the Lord sent into thy streets, highways, and Idols Temples? to
declare what they have seen, tasted, and handled of the Word of Life, and has
proclaimed this notable terrible day, which they see is coming upon thee, and
to declare unto thee thy sins and transgressions, and how great the indignation
of the glorious God will be executed upon thee by reason of them, and for
clearing their consciences, and being obedient unto the Commands of the Lord,
some of them have thou stoned, and some imprisoned, and cruelly beat, and
unmercifully used them, of which doings the Lord takes notice, and hears the
groans of the innocent, and the cries of the oppressed: O! its entered, its
entered into the ears of the Lord God of Sabbath, who knows how great our
sufferings is in this City, and in all quarters of the whole earth, where we
have been sent, we have groaned under cruel oppression and tyranny, by unjust
Judges, and unrighteous Rulers, especially by our own Countrymen, and in the
Land of our Nativity, for which my spirit is troubled, because we all profess
the name of Christians, and own Christ in words, to be a Savior, but in works
and life you deny him; and by this thing is the name of the Lord blasphemed
amongst all them, who does not own Christ at all, whom you call Heathens; but
truly their life condemns yours, they having no Law, are a Law unto themselves,
and they shall rise up in Judgment with this Generation, who draws nigh unto
the Lord with their lips, and their mouths, but their hearts is far from God: O
the Lord God will be eased of such a vain Religion as this, he that sees thee
in secret is the munition of rocks, and he will reward thee openly, his Sickle
shall pierce thy heart, and his sword shall rip up thy bowels; pain, sorrow,
and anguish shall overtake thee, as a woman in travel, and from it thou shall
not escape: O friends! as a woman has pain before she brings forth, so
certainly and surely must you feel the pangs of death, before you know the
Birth immortal; and if that this be not witnessed, there is no seeing of God,
nor no inhabiting of his holy Hill, where alone dwells purity; holiness, and
righteousness for ever: O search and try, you who are Citizens of this mortal
City, which may truly be called Sodom and Egypt, for in thee is the Son of God
crucified, and put to open shame! Do you feel or know a part in another City
which is immutable, which fades not away? Do you eat of the hidden Manna which
corrupts not? or do you drink of the Blood of the Lamb? Have you yet found
peace with the Lord? Are you reconciled unto the God of Jacob? Are you saved,
or saving from your sins? Or have you seen the Lord, and the place where the
mighty God dwells? if not, your Religion is all in vain, and if you do not
speedily repent, you shall die in your sins, and where he is, you shall not
come; This will be his answer unto you, who is the Alpha and Omega, the first
and the last, Depart ye workers of iniquity, I know you not: O this will be sad
tidings unto you, who have got a fair covering, but its not of the Spirit of
God, which the Lord will rent off in the day when he shall take peace from the
earth! O ye Inhabitants of this bloody City! cast away every man from him the
Idols of Egypt, with your gods of gold and silver, of precious stones and
goodly houses, and make no longer your belly your gods, least God cut you off
in this day in which he is slaying the wicked with the Firstborn of Egypt, the
Lord will choke Pharaoh, with all his Host, in the Sea of confusion! O! a night
of darkness is a coming upon thee, and upon all thy neighbor Cities, O! a
thick cloud covers thee, mists and fogs is spread upon thee, thy glory is
staining, thy honor is laying in the dust, and thy mortal Crown shall be thrown
into the pit, thy destruction is coming upon thee at noonday; thou shall look
for light, but have none, and for the dawning of the day, but it shall not
appear; glad tidings shall be hid from thee, sorrow, and trouble, and fear,
shall compass thee about; thou shall wish for death rather then life, and for
the grave, but shall not find it, then shall thou seek to thy Priests, thy
Rulers, and Judges, who have caused thee to err, thinking thereby to get
peace, but shall find none; the earth shall not bring forth unto thee her
increase, as in times past; and as thy vultrous eye has been delighted with
vanity, and thy adulterated ear has been filled with curiosities of strange
voices, and thy heart has been filled with lust, pride, and vanity, thy tongue
exercised with cursing, swearing, and lying, cheating and cozening, and taking
the Name of the Lord in vain; and as thy feet has walked after pleasures, and
thy hand has handled deceitfulness, guile, and fraud, and have been all
servants unto sin, and fulfilling the devils will, even so must the Vengeance
and Plagues of the Lord be powered out upon the Man of Sin, which has
captivated thy mind, and misled thy members, which was created only and alone
to serve the living God, the Creator of Heaven and Earth. O! what rioting,
swearing, cursing and drunkenness, murder, whoredom, and theft, is found in
thee, which grieveth the soul of the righteous, cozening, and cheating, and
deceiving souls for dishonest gain, buying and selling the Words of God on the
Market day, and in the Idols Temple, all this is found in thee, which Words of
God, the holy men of God spoke them to the people freely; as they had freely
received; they coveted no man's gold, or silver, but having food and raiment,
they were therewith content; and they who preached freely, were Coheirs with
Christ, who had purchased a City for them, whose Builder and Maker is God, they
said to the Scribes and Pharisees which sat in Moses Chair, who had the
Prophets words read amongst them, that they would not enter in themselves, nor
let others to enter in: They said also, that they might all prophecy one by
one, and if any thing was revealed to one that stood by, he was to speak, and
the first was to hold his peace, for God is a God of Order; but in this our
day, which is the Lords, and the time wherein we are cast, if any in the Spirit
of the Lord come amongst you, and be moved to speak in his power, thou beatest,
and bruisest, and hallest before thy Magistrates, and castest into prisons, by
this we see plainly and clearly, that thy Religion is not the pure Religion,
and that thy Church is the Church of Rome, and thou art governed by the Whores
power, which God is laying wast, and dashing to pieces, in this his glorious
day: Thy clouds of Religion, be they never so thick, they are seen thorongh; in
the light and power of God we do measure the height, the length, depth, and
breadth of all thy Religion, thy Sun is eclipsed, and thy glory is fallen. O
thou Lucifer, Son of the Morning! thy portion is in the lowermost hell, thy
part and lot is vanished away, and thy beauty is driven away, as the dust in
the Summers day before the wind; woe from the Lord God of Power be unto thy
lawyers, for they have stolen away the key of knowledge: O the oppressed
groaneth under their cruel tyranny of oppression! they lie in wait to ensnare
the simple, and to beguile and entrap the honest-hearted; but the Lord loves
the pure in heart, and preserves them out of the Lions mouth, and out of the
paw of the Bear, glory be to God on high, Dominion and strength be given to his
Son for evermore: Howl ye Lawyers, weep bitterly ye Rulers, and Judges, lament
ye Priests, for the day of Gods account is coming on, and it hasteneth, wherein
the Book of Conscience shall be opened, wherein your sins are written, as with
the point of a Diamond, and out of the Book of Life you shall be judged,
according as your works shall be, so shall your reward be, for our God is pure
and immortal, he will torment the wicked, and plague the ungodly, and cast into
the pit for ever: O! I most humbly beseech you, as in Christ stead, leave off
your covetousness, with your hypocritical Religion, your fained prayers, and
abhor your selves in dust and ashes, that repentance and amendment of Life you
may know with the Lord, before thy house of clay be dissolved, for the Son of
Life weepeth over thee, as he did over Jerusalem. O that thy eyes were open,
and thy heart unvailed, that thou mights see how good the Lord is unto all the
sons and daughters of men, and how long he has tendered his mercy and grace
unto thee, and has held forth his hand with a cup of blessings for thee, but
thou have joined issue with the transgressor, and art rebellions and
stiff-necked against the Seed of God, the Lord God make thee sensible of thy
backslidings, and heal thee, if he see it good: O! my soul is truly powered
forth unto the Lord for thee, that thou may est not inherit the Lake which is
prepared, but peace and rest for thy immortal soul thou may find; for the
soul is immortal, and there is no mortal thing can satisfy thy soul, but the
presence of the Lord, which is far beyond the gold of Ophir, or the Onick
stone. O! what would thou give for peace with God, when thy day shall be
turned into darness, and thy table shall be made a snare unto thee, and thou
shall be like the hearth in the Wilderness, which sees not when good comes,
thy lovers shall pass away, and trouble shall compass thee round about; then if
thou had the whole world thou would give it for peace with God, but then
will thy day be sealed up, and there will be no place found for repentance;
therefore I desire thee in the dreadful power of God, put not the day of the
Lord afar off, but let the Sword of the Lord cut down, and the fire burn up all
that is contrary to God; and away with thy Idols, down with thy Images, pluck
down thy high places, for the Lord will be avenged of thy Groves, thy strong
Oaks, and tall Cedars, and he will ride upon thy high hills, and thy fenced
City will he lay waste; and he will ease the innocent, and deliver the
oppressed, thy prison doors shall be broke up, and the bonds of iniquity burst
asunder, the agreement made with hell and death will be disannulled; and though
many of us have been halled out of your Mass-houses, and have been halled
before Magistrates, both by Papists and Protestants; yet know this, that our
God in whom we trust, he lives for ever, and he sits as Judge amongst the Gods.
O! the fury of the Lord is gone forth against the wicked, and they shall not
prosper, and although they may reign for a while, and build their nests in the
stars for a short time, and join hand in hand to punish the righteous, and to
oppress the just, and to oppose Christ and his Kingdom, yet he whose glorious
reign is begun in the earth, who is the King of Saints, and Governor of heaven
and earth, he will pluck them from their stately thrones, and disinherit them
of their mortal life, unless they turn to the sword which will cut, and to the
axe which will hew, and to the fire which will burn them; then will thou come
to know the Circumcision which is made without hands, and a baptizing into
Christ's death; and if a baptizing, then a death of deaths unto all mortal, and
visible, and dying things; then will thou be a new creature, All old things
will pass away, the old heavens and the old earth will be burned up, and a new
heaven, and a new earth will be created in righteousness, wherein the Lamb
dwells, whose Name is called the Word of God, who is the light of the world,
and was given of the Father a light to lighten the Gentiles, and to be the
glory of his people Israel:This light checks thee in secret, when no mortal eye
sees what thou art doing; this light beholds thee; and this is Gods swift
Witness, which he has placed in man, which is only and alone sufficient to
lead into immortal life, although the blind guides, who are of the cursed stock
of Ham, says, that this light which is in man, is natural, and not sufficient
of it self to lead to God. This is my testimony friends, which I must bear
amongst you, for the true light, against all that does oppose it, who has been
a Citizen with you in this bloody City, and have been feeding with you upon the
husks with the Swine, and alienated from God, and a stranger to his life, as
you are at this day, whilst I was one with you in your Religion and Worship,
my soul was hungry, and was even black with thirst, I had almost fallen in your
streets for want of the Bread of Life; no peace nor true rest amongst you could
I find, yet mornings, and evenings, and at noonday, I sought the Lord, but
could not find him, because I was not in his way, neither did I hearken to his
light, neither could any of your chief Priests tell me where the Lord was to be
found, but told me in heaven, but what heaven was, and where it was, they knew
not; the light which is pure condemned me, and no peace with the Lord could I
find amongst all your dead worships, and earthly performances; but at length
the Lord, ^ho is rich in mercy, he looked down from his holy habitation, and he
saw there was no help amongst men, nor no refreshments to be received from
their Ministry, but my soul was dying and fainting away, with a numberless
number besides me, by reason of our sins and transgressions, then the Lord sent
in fullness of time his Servants into this City, F H and E B, who spoke the Word
of Eternal Life, whereby my weary soul was refreshed, and the dead heard, and
lived, and glorifies the Lord in the land of the living: Glory and honor be
given to God, who sent them furnished with the treasure of knowledge and
wisdom, and to speak comfort unto the prisoner of hope; and I, amongst many in
this City, may bless the hour and the time that they came in the Power and
Spirit of God to visit this City, for by their coming was I turned from
darkness to light, and from Satan's power to Gods; and they were instruments in
the hand of the Lord to bring me to his Kingdom, the Lord God in his endless
love has made me forsake this City, with all the glory and pleasures of it,
and I see another City, and do inhabit a more durable habitation, which will
never fade away, but will stand me in stead for ever; and by the light of
Christ, which is eternal, was I brought to this habitation; and if ever thou
come to God, thou must own this light which thy Teachers speak against: if
thou will love the light, it will lead thee in a path which thou have not yet
trodden in; there is no Lion, or Lions Whelp, has trodden in this path, no
vultrous eye has seen it; therefore thou must come forth of thy fallen estate,
thy whoredoms and ungodliness, before one step thou can tread in; therefore
repent, and come and drink freely of our Fountain, and eat of our Rock, who
lives for ever: O! my hearts desire unto the Lord is, that you may be saved
from your sin, and purged from your iniquities, and be made clean by the blood
of the Lamb, before you return to the dust from whence you came, and shall be
seen no more: For friends, there must be a laying down of the earthly, and as
that is laid down, there is a receiving of the heavenly; but if you live in
sin, and die in sin, then is there no redemption from sin, sin separates from
God; the wa^^^ of sin is death, and after death to Judgment: Hell is prepar^^
for the wicked, and the worm which shall never die, and the fire that shall
never be quenched, is the sinners portion, who lives and dies in sin; For there
is no repentance in the grave, nor no remissinn of sin after death, but as the
tree falls, so it lies, as Death leaves you, Judgment will find you; and
as the lightening shines in the East unto the West, so is the coming of the
Son of man in his day upon all sinners: He will come as a thief in the night
upon thee, then what secret corner have thou to hide thee in? or what remote
place can thou fly unto for shelter? seeing our God is potent over Sea and
Land, and his eye is over the whole world, and his hand is stretched over all
living. O! the Rocks and the Mountains shall not cover thee, nor dens, nor
holes, nor caves of the earth shall not shelter thee, but the Lord will be
avenged of thee, and plead with thee himself, who is a just God, and a Savior,
and will give unto every man according as his works shall be, from whose
presence the wicked must depart. O! blessed and happy for ever are all they who
knows a redeeming from amongst men, and from a vain and a light conversation,
by the precious blood of the Lamb. O! give thanks to God fro ever, that he
has, and is giving you a possession in the durable inheritance, that never
fades away; you are built upon the Rock of Ages, never to be removed. O! let
us dwell together in the unity of the Spirit, and in the bond of love for ever,
that we may stand for ever witnesses against this wicked and perverse
Generation, who have not the fear of God before their eyes, whom God will
destroy as he did the old world, and they shall be as ashes under the soals of
the righteous feet. O London! in the presence of the Lord God I declare unto
thee, thy peace is not durable, neither will thy Faith remain, it is as the
raging Sea, whose waves are up and down, and thou art tossed in thy mind, as a
Ship upon the Sea, driven with a mighty wind; thy hope is in man, and it
fails; thy joy is dying, and will die away. O! therefore put thy trust in the
living God, and not in man, whose breath is in his nostrils, that thou may
be saved from the day of wrath, which will suddenly come upon the families of
the earth: All Nations shall partake of his wrath, and all Tongues of his fury;
for all flesh has corrupted its way before the Lord, all flesh has sinned,
and come short of the glory of God, so all flesh must know the wrath of God
executed upon the wicked, for the Lord has determined a Consumption to come
upon the whole earth; therefore O earth, earth! hear the Word of the Lord, and
be thou separated from your uncleanness, and live before the Lord, that all the
days of thy appointed time, thou may wait till the change comes, for
nothing but life will stand before the Lord, who is immortal. And know this of
a truth, that this is written in pure love to thy soul: O London! the righteous
is oppressed in thee, and the innocent cries in thy streets, by reason of
oppression: O! feed the hungry, and cloth the naked, and hide not thy self
from thy own flesh, for you are all made of one blood, and one mould, upon the
face of the whole earth: He that says he loves God, and does not feed the
hungry, and cloth the naked, and judge the cause of the poor and needy, he is
a liar, and does not the truth. And know this ye Judges, and Rulers, and
Magistrates, that there is a Judge above you which will call you to an account,
and will judge you out of the book of Conscience, and give you a full reward;
and you shall all know in the day when the Lord rips off all coverings, and
takes peace from the earth, that there is a Deliverer in Sion, which will
deliver his righteous seed, and none shall hinder; and although we are despised
in thee, and hated by thee, yet the Lord who is the everlasting Councellor and
Prince of Peace, he is our Redeemer, who is the portion of our cup, and the lot
of our inheritance, and we have none in heaven but him, nor upon earth that can
deliver but he, and he will plead our cause with them that hate us, and our
innocence shall appear as the Sun in her full strength, and we shall be as a
morning without clouds, when the Lord shall arise, and take the honor to
himself, and exalt his Kingdom above the heavens, and his Dominion above the
stars, then shall Jerusalem be the praise of the whole earth, and they shall
rejoice in her who now mourns, and say one to another, Come let us stand upon
Mount Sion, and sit down upon the holyhill, for our God and his Christ reigns
over all the whole earth. O! this is a blessed estate which the ^ighteous does
inherit; but as for the wicked, they are as stubble thoroughly dried; and the
Word of the Lord is as a fire, and they must be burned up, and be shut without
the gates of the City, where the Lamb treads the Wine Press of Gods wrath. So
in the fear of the Lord repent, and amend thy life, least God sweep thee away
into the pit of utter destruction, out of which there is no redemption.

Oh London! the Lord God of Heaven and of Earth, he is burdened with thy vain
Religion; who makes a profession of God, and of Christ, and yet lives in lust
and vanity, pride and vainglory, in swearing and curfing, and yet is covered
with a covering which the Lord will take away: O how does gluttony abound in
thee, rioting and sporting in the day time! thou know not how almost to go
along the streets, thou art so proud and haughty, and the poor in thee are
ready to famish, for whose estate and condition my heart is pained within me,
old and young, blind and lame, lies in thy streets, and at thy Masse-houses
doors crying for bread, who are almost naked for want of clothing, and
fainting for want of bread, and yet thou can pass by them in thy gaudy
apparel; and our-stretched neck, with thy face decked with black spots, which
are the marks of the Whore, the Beast, and the False Prophet, which is not the
attire of Sarah, Abraham's wife: Thou know not what to eat, nor what to
drink, nor wherewith to be clothed, thy mind is so vain, and thy Religion is
so aerie; and if any of these that are blind, or lame, or destitute of a being,
asks of thee a penny, or farthing, thou say thou have it not for them. O!
remember the Lord will call thee to an account; and truly a sad day it will be
for thee, when he shall take thy peace away; who has lavishly spent Gods
Creation upon thy lusts, and has not distributed thy morsel to the poor, and
to the needy, the light of Christ in thy Conscience condemns thee for thy not
so doing, and from that thou can not fly, that shall be thy condemnation for
ever if thou hate it, and thy salvation for ever, if thou love it. O!
tremble and quake before the Lord, ye sons of Sodom, and Daughters of Gomorrah,
who does inhabit this mortal City which doth-corrupt, and will die away, your
glory the Lord will bring to nothing; therefore keep to the light which
condemns you, that an entrance into the immortal Kingdom you may find: Woe be
unto all thy Usurers, who hoardeth up the unrighteous mammon, and does not lend
to the poor and distressed, and says, they have it not for them, the rust of
their money in the Day of Judgment shall rise up against them, and Gods swift
Witness in their own hearts shall condemn them which lives for ever; therefore
all ye Usurers, Soothsayers, and Star-gazers, that inhabiteth this place, and
elsewhere, repent, for Gods plagues and Judgments is to be executed upon you,
and upon all that lends an ear unto you, you Star-gazers and Astrologers, who
can discern the face of the Sky, but does not know the signs of the coming of
the Son of Man, whose glorious appearance will discover your dark works that
you act in the dark night, and tho night shall pass away, and you shall know a
day of Judgment, and see him whom you have pierced, of whom the Sun, Moon, and
Stars, bears testimony, and keeps their station with God; therefore its good
for you to know the Rod of God, to instruct you in his path, and to lead you to
his Kingdom, and this is the desire of my soul, that you may all inhabit
peace, and rest with the King of Heaven and Earth: So know, that your day of
visitation is now, the Lord does hold forth unto you mercy and peace, therefore
embrace it whilst it is tendered unto you, least you be shut out, and your day
be sealed up.

The Lord is risen in Sion, and is shining forth in the perfection of beauty
and holiness for ever: O! how glorious and beautiful are his garments? and how
lovely is his countenance unto all his sons and daughters, who have forsaken
all to follow him, who is a man of sorrows, and well acquainted with grief; who
trampled upon all the glory of this world, the Oni^k stones, and the gold of
Ophir was nothing unto him, neither are they any thing in comparison of him,
for all who does enjoy him, enjoys fullness, both of wisdom, and knowledge,
prudence, and understanding; he does endow them with all those treasures which
this empty world cannot afford; he is not of this world, who is the seed, the
light, the power of God, but he is Heir of Eternal Peace, and in him are the
families of the earth blessed, who does deny themselves, and take up their
daily cross, and follow the Seed, the Angel of the New Covenent, wheresoever
he goes; it is they that are saved, who walks in the light of life, and does
rejoice in sufferings, trials and tribulations, knowing that thorough these
things they must enter into the Lambs Kingdom, and hereby may they know that
they are in the way of God, for this is a remarkable token whereby they may
know that they are in their spiritual journey; if they are hated and persecuted
of all men for righteousness sake, then are ye blessed of the most high God?
Art thou halled out of the Synagogues, and plucked before Rulers, for the
Kingdom of Heavens sake? Art thou made a prey of in the gate, for reproving sin
and iniquity in the gate, and suffers the enemy to plough long furrows upon
thy ba^k, for the testimony of truths sake? Know this, thy reward is great in
the Kingdom of heaven; and these are marks and tokens wherein thou may
certainly know that thy journey is holy, and thy path is pure wherein thou
treadest, where thy persecutors can by no means walk in, but they must own thee
and thy life, which will slay the first nature, birth, and glory, and bring
into the fools estate, that ye may truly be made wise, and endued with the
treasure of wisdom, which lives and abides for ever. O! all ye my dear
friends, that knows a bathing and washing, and a making white in the blood of
the Lamb, unto you does my Royal love flow forth from the fountain of life: O!
ye are near and dear unto me, as in the fountain of love ye dwell, which
knitteth our hearts together in one, which is Christ, the Way, the Truth, and
the Life, unto whom none can come, but they who does deny their own wills,
their pleasures and delights, and bow to his Sceptor which is swayed in
righteousness: O! they must lay down their Crowns at the feet of the Immortal
Birth, the Seed Royal, which is a Noble Priesthood, which remains for ever,
before they can have peace with him: Therefore all ye Lambs, and Babes, and
Plants of God, in the Lords power dwell, that you may be preserved in the day
of trial, which is coming to try all them that dwells upon the earth; and in
the hour of temptation, you may find bread in your own house, and water in your
own Well, which will satisfy your soul in the time of draught, that glory and
honor you may render unto the Lord, whose Name is, I am, and there is none like
him amongst all the gods, who saves his people from their fine, and blotteth
out their transgressions, who fills both heaven and earth with his glory;
Glory, and eternal honor, and everlasting dominion be ascribed unto the God of
my life, who is eternally pure, and as he is, so is his City, which is a
habitation for all the followers of the Lamb, the situation is righteous
indeed, and is of Gods own Nature, which Nature has fallen man received a
measure from the beautiful God to bring him out of sin, and transgression, and
to redeem him wholly from the fallen estate, it is placed in man only and alone
to redeem him from death to life, and to be his salvation, and satisfaction, or
condemnation for ever; and this is my witness in every man, and to this do I
speak, and it shall arise and answer for me in the day of the Lord; and this is
the seed that the Lord has left in the earth, in which seed the families of
the earth is blessed, and in the seeds light shall all the Nations that are
saved walk in, and triumph in his name, which is called the Word of God, by
which the world was made, and the heavens was framed, who was in his Fathers
bosom before man was, or had a being upon the earth, and shall live and abide
for ever, glory and thanks be given unto the Lord, whose Royal Standard is set
up in the earth, and whose Reign is begun upon the earth, and whose Tabernacle
is with men, whose dwelling and abiding is with the sons and daughters of men:
Glory over all Sea and Land be given to the pure God, who searches; and
tries, and sees the way of all flesh, and its he that justifies the
righteous, and who is he that does condemn, or lay any thing to the charge of
Gods Elect? It is the Lamb of God that takes away all sin, and in him is no
sin, and if he condemns, who can justify? Therefore let all that are
justified, and set free by the Lamb, abide in their freedom, and live in the
power and life of the Birth Immortal, that they may not be entangled again with
the yoke of bondage, which is truly a yoke indeed, and heavier to be borne then
it was at the first: for there remains no more sacrifice for sin unto such
who have tasted of the Word of God, and of the powers of the world to come, and
afterward looks back to Egypt, and to the goodlinesse of Pharaohs house,
such falls short of a resting place, and dies in the wilderness, and
leaves an ill savor unto Generations to come: But blessed and happy are all
by Sea and Land, who abides low in their measures of life given them, by the
husbandman, who is Lord over Sea and Land, and enters into the good land,
and sees all to be turned out before them, and inherit the promise, and the
Kingdom without end, with Caleb and Joshud, who have fought a good fight, and
lay down their heads in peace, and entered into rest with their Fathers, who
gained a good report, and are a good savor unto this day unto all that does
believe in the same Gospel which was preached unto Abraham, who saw the Gospel,
and believed in it: So all that are of faith, are of Abraham, for his Seed
shall be multiplied as the stars of heaven, or the sand upon the Sea shore for
number, which is the Seed of the Kingdom of God, there is a numberless number
that is redeemed and redeeming out of Nations, Tongues, and people, by the seed
up to God and many there is, whose faces are turned toward Sion, the City of
our solemnity, there to praise the Lord in that City; the morning stars meet
together, and the Sons of God shoot for joy, and sings Halelujah to the
Highest; the Bridegroom is come, and he has betrothed them to himself, who
cannot but rejoice; his Table is prepared, where the Lambs and Babes eats,
and is satisfied; there is a river as clear as Crystal, which runs softly,
of which all drinks freely, and is satisfied. O! here is fullness of joy to be
reaped in this City, honor, glory, and dignity inhabiteth here: O! come hither
all ye ignorant, unwise, and simple ones, who knows not a stay to your minds,
nor a resting place for the soal of your feet, neither satisfaction for your
souls: O! come and drink, and eat freely with us, without money and without
price, for we have found him whom our souls loves, who is the choicest of ten
thousand, and the chiefest in the whole earth, he has been exposed from
amongst us for many years, but now is he come, contrary to the whole earths
expectation, to visit and redeem his people, and to get himself a name in the
earth: Glory be to him who has been as a stranger upon the earth for ages, and
as a wayfaring man; to tarr^ for a night for Generations, but glory for ever,
he is well known in Sion, for he has comforted the mourners therein, and he
has revived the fainting spirit, and has bound up the brokenhearted, the
feeble knees has he strengthened, the blind he causes to see, and the lame to
go upright, the Leopard is cleansed, the dead is raised, the deaf hears, the
dumb speaks, all this is done by Sions King, in this the latter day, and our
eyes has seen it. O! what tongue is able to express the Noble acts of our
God: O! its unutterable and undeclarable, words are too short, Declarations
must end, but the life by which they are written, lives in it self for ever
and ever. O! all ye dear and tender ones, who does abide either by Sea or Land,
dwell in the pure life, in the single being, in the lovely estate, let not your
minds be captivated by any created object, or visible thing, but feel the birth
immortal to be brought forth, and reign over the world; and you espoused to
Christ, Children of the Lamb, Heirs of the world which is without end, let him
be your beloved alone, who is light and life, beauty and strength, wisdom and
prudence, altogether lovely and glorious, whose day is glorious and perfect,
and all must be perfect that walks in it; therefore be ye holy as he is holy,
without which none shall see God, who is immutable, and dwells in everlasting
burnings, no flesh can see him and live: O! the notable terrible day of the
Lord will suddenly come upon all slothful and disobedient ones, who idly
spends away their present time, and hides Gods money in the earth, but an
account one day must you all give, when the last Trumpet shall sound; then
shall you come to Judgment, the Just to the Resurrection of Life, and the
unjust to everlasting torments; therefore be awakened all ye that have been
long convinced of the truth of God; arise and shake off the dust of the earth,
plough up the fallow ground of your hearts with the power of God, let judgment
be brought forth unto victory, let the Sickle reap the earth, that the
righteous branch may come forth, which you hold in bondage thorough your
negligence and unbelief: O! dishonor the Lord no longer with your outside
profession, which is as a shell without a kernel, which God will rent off, it
will not cover you no longer, for it is deceit, and a hypocritical Religion,
which is covered over with fair words, and a fair gloss on the outside, and
within side is rottenness and putrefying sores: O! this is loathsome in the
sight of the Lord; woe be unto all from the Lord God of heaven and earth, who
holds the truth of God in unrighteousness: O! your coverings will be too
narrow to cover you, and your beds will be too short to stretch your selves on,
for the Lord is come to torment you: O! the Lake is prepared for you, that
burns for ever: O! what will you do, when the Lord shall appear to strip you,
and to uncrown you, and bereave you of all your mortal glory, and lay your
honor in the dust, then without repentance there will be no enjoying of Gods
presence, which gives life to the weary soul: O repent, repent! ye Aliens and
strangers, who are yet without the knowledge of the pure God, and knows not an
entrance into an undefiled being, which is made without hands: O! come and sit
down where we have sat, abhorring our selves in dust and ashes, we have lain
as they that have been dead of old, and our sorrow has been our sin, and our
beauty has been turned into ashes, and our glory as stubble, and our hour as
the morning dew, and our wisdom as a shadow which has been, and now is not: O
consider! all ye Kings and Princes, Dukes and Earls, Lords and Ladies,
Governors and Magistrates, Priests and Jesuits, this will the Lord do by you,
as he has done by us, he will lay your habitations wast, who respects not the
person of any, but you shall sit as a Widow, that is, rebuked of husband and
children, bemoaning her self; even so shall you be: But if you are willing to
endure this straight way, and narrow gate, wherein nothing that is of this
world shall enter, but must be laid down; and if you will deny your selves, and
take up your daily cross, and follow the light, whom you have grieved and
wounded with your whoredoms and idolatry whithersoever he goes, then shall
you be with us, where we are, and eat and drink with us of the living Bread and
Water of Life, and see him who is invisible, who cannot be seen but by Faith,
and this Faith purifies the heart, and makes pure, as God is pure. O! Come
unto the Fountain of Life, and drink freely with us: O! Christ has invited all
upon the whole face of the earth, poor and rich, to come into his banqueting
house, and to eat freely of the Bread of Life, and to drink of the still waters
of Shilo, which satisfies the hungry soul. O! come to our Shepherd, who has
laid down his life for his sheep: O come! and see how good he is, and where he
feeds his flock at noonday; O! come into his Fold, who is all love, and
life, and gains unto God the hungry soul, and reconcileth every tired spirit
which pants after him, and blessed are all they who feels satisfaction with
the Lord, it is better then wine or oil; and all who joyneth issue with the
Seed of God, they know a more durable increase, for they increase in wisdom,
purity, and holiness, and so dwells with the Lord in their measures. O! all
ye that have followed Christ, the Heir of Life and Salvation, and does follow
him in the straight way, and narrow gate, your portion is eternal, if you dwell
therein, and look not out at the over-turnings of men, and their power, and
what they may inflict upon you, or cause you to suffer hardships for your
Religion, which you profess in truth and righteousness, but look to the Lord,
who has the hea^ts of all the Sons and Daughters of Adam in his hand, and as a
river of water he can turn them whither soever he will: therefore my dear
beloved friends, who are friends of God, let us dwell together in the life
immortal, and let us be compassed about with Gods righteousness and strength
for ever, that if the Lord suffers that we should suffer death for our
Religion which is pure, let us choose it rather then life, and joyfully, and
heartily, and patiently embrace it, and bear it, for our God is good, and in
the midst of flames (he has) and will be with us, and from the waters he will
deliver us; in the sixth trouble he has been with us, and from the seventh he
has delivered us, glory be to him who is as a wall of brass round about us,
and as a flame of fire he compasses us about; he was with the Patriarchs in
the deepest of their calamities; the Prophets in times past he upheld, and was
their meat and drink, and in him they rejoiced, and with him they suffered, and
finished their testimony in faithfulness; he was unto the Disciples, a stay,
and a staff, salvation and righteousness, even their exceeding great reward;
their houses was filled with his life and power, he was a mouth of utterance
unto them, he carried them thorough great trials, he was their meat and drink,
and they fed upon him in a weary Land, even so can we truly say, that he has
been with us in a vast howling wilderness, in a strange Land, and amongst
strange people, who have not truly worshipped the God of heaven and earth, he
has been our stay and the upholder of our head in the day of battle: Glory be
to him who is our Rock, who never leaved nor forsaked any that fears him, but
he waters them with the dew from heaven, and makes them green as the grass,
or tender plants; he cloatheth them far beyond the Lillies in the field, he
gives breath, and life, and length of days for ever in his sight; therefore
all who have known this clothing, let it dwell with you for ever, and let your
hearts be upright in his sight, your consciences exercised continually in the
sight of God and men; and the Lord God of heaven and of earth preserve us all
in all, and over all, and thorough all, up to himself: The grace of our Lord
Jesus Christ, which is perfect, and the peace which stands for ever, keep
your hearts and minds staid upon him for ever, out of all mortal and dying
things.

London the 16th of the 12th Month, 1659. E. B.

Something after.
O London! who should^t be as a nursing Mother unto thy Nation, and a Pattern
and Example unto all Nations, for in thee and from thee does the Law proceed,
and Council is given forth which should be pure, and thy Law direct, whereby
the Just and Innocent might be Judged in Righteousness; thy Judges and Rulers
should Judge for God, and be guided by the just Law of God in them, but for
want of true Judgment and Equity the Just is oppressed, and the Innocent and
Harmless groaneth for want of Righteous Rulers and Godly Judges, and wholesome
Laws. O London thou have sacrificed upon the Mountains unto sirange gods, and
that is Cains sacrifice which the Lord accepts not, neither does he regard
your Joy and Mirth, for your joy is but for a moment says the Lord, but your
sorrow is for ever and for ever, and your torment world without end, O! my Soul
lamenteth for thee, to see what an estate thou art in, all above the witness of
the pure God, in ungodliness, lust, pride and wantonness, you spend Gods
Creation upon your lusts, pride and vain glory; O! let the Seed of the Lord
arise in you, and condemn you and bear witness for me and the rest of us who
are called and calling out of you, and are redeeming from amongst you up to
God, and our Souls is sorrowful for to see how you neglect the pure way of God.
And likewise the day of your visitation, my heart did even bleed within me to
see your sacrifices, knowing from whence it came, and whether it went, and to
whom it was offered; And I could have wept day and night to have seen the path
of Righteousness trodden down, and all trampling upon the Seed of God, which
lies low in you, some in drunkenness, others in swearing and taking the Name
of God in vain, some in pushing and haling and beating the Lambs of God, and
all in disorder dishonouring of God, on the 21th of the 12th Month, 1659. your
evil works and words did exceed in that day and night, and it shall rise up in
Judgment against you, that day and night shall you remember with all the rest
of your time ill spent, to your torment and utter overthrowing; and know this,
that God will call you to Judgment, and give you your portion with the
hypocrites, unless you repent and amend your lives; therefore every one who
has any true desires after the Lord, be ye separated from the wickedness that
is acted in this City, and from the actors of it, that you may find your
desires to be satisfied, and your souls raised up out of the pit, and saves
from the condemnation which is coming upon all workers of iniquity; the Lord
spares and suffers but for a time, until he has gathered his remnant from
amongst you, and made up his Jewels which shall live in his house for ever,
Then desolation and misery and a woeful cry shall be heard in your streets, and
your houses shall be left unto you desolate, and your Idols temples shall be a
habitation for Owls and Birds, the Satyrs shall dance there, they shall be a
habitation for every unclean spirit, your Priests shall preach no more, and
your Diviners shall go mad, God will dry up the tongue of the Egyptian Sea, who
has opened a door of mercy in this City in due season, and has given you yet
a Day to repent in, but remember thy Day will be over, as thy Sisters Sodoms
and Gomorrahs, their time was spent, and the Day of their visitation is passed,
the Lord spared the Righteous, even Just Lot, whose Soul was grieved with the
ungodly conversation of the wicked; even so is ours, this day with the unjust
and impure conversation of thee O London: but Ju^t is our God and Righteous for
evermore, who is able to deliver us, and has delivered us out of the flames
which sha^^ come upon you our God beholds all your unjust proceedings with
his Seed, for which he will give you your reward, who is a Just God, and a
Savior; and woe from the Lord God be unto all the Magistrates and Rulers of
this City, who does not Rule yet in Righteousness; and woe from the Lord be unto
all Masters and Mistresses that does inhabit this place before mentioned, who
does not order their Families in the fear of God, nor are not in the fear nor
power themselves, who one day shall know another Master who will give you a
just reward according as your works shall be, who is Gods Righteousness, and to
whom all power in Heaven and Earth is given, and it is he alone that will Judge
this bloody City with all the Families and Kindreds of the whole Earth, and
they shall not escape his Righteous Judgments, although thou may cry for the
Rocks and the Mountains to cover thee, and thy Religion to hide thee from the
wrath of God, but it cannot be, for his eye, whom we serve, is over the whole
world, and his Arm of Power is stretched over thee with a sword which is
fourbished in his hand, which will cut down and utterly destroy thy Priests in
thee, who divineth for money, and preaches for filthy lucre, and love give ye,
which feeds of the fat and cloatheth with the wool and makes Merchandise of
Souls with fair words; Gods vengeance, woe and wrath is their portion, and they
shall fall by the sword of the living God, thy Judges and Rulers shall be slain
in the day that the Lord visits thee in the fierceness of his wrath, for his
Soul is burdened with thee, and his Spirit is grieved every moment of time
with thy filthy conversation; therefore repent, for the day is coming, and thy
time of torment and misery hasteneth apace, thy condemnation slumbereth not,
thou have forgotten good days without number, and thou art yet in the land of
forgetfulness, thy ^imes testifies against thee, and thy iniquities is gone
over thy head, and thy transgressions is without number, even as the stars in
the firmament, and thy ungodliness before the Lord is for multitude as the
sands of the Sea shore, thou ha^t corrupted thy way before the Lord, and art
fallen short of the glory of the Lord; therefore return to the measure of Gods
Spirit, that thou mai^t know amendment of life and an inheritance in another
City before thou art dispossessed of this City: and peace and re^t, purity and
joy may possess thy house, and the New Heaven and the New Earth thou may
witness, and a feeding upon the bread of Life that makes truly wise, and a
drinking of the water of life which truly satisfies the immortal Soul; this
must thou witness if ever thou will enjoy the pure habitation of God, or sit
down upon his holy Hill which is beautiful indeed before thou returns to the
d^^t from whence thou came, there is the center of the earthly; the center of
the heavenly is unmortal and dwells in immortality, and as thou serve^t and
obeyest, and joineth issue with this, it will lead thee up to God the Savior
and Redeemer of thy Soul, where the earthly center and the first birth and
nature cannot enter, there is a great gulf and separation between the two seeds
and the two natures, the one delights to ser^e the Lord, and it is its nature
to work, Righteousness and Holiness for ever, and it cannot join with the
cursed the other is continually prone to do wickedness, and it leads in
drunkenness, lying, swearing and d^ssembling, cheating and cozening, and it
cannot do good, neither shall it have a habitation with Abels nature, who
sacrificed upon Gods Altar a Sacrifice of praise, and the Lord had regard unto
to it: So if thou joyneth with Hagars Seed, the Bondwoman, thou shall not
inherit the durable possession; therefore as thou love the good of thy soul,
and thy immortal life, return to that which yet condemns thee, which is the
light of Christ, and it is pure and immortal, and know it to justify thee, for
the Spirit of the pure God will not always strive with thee, no more then it
d^d with the Old World: O thou City of London! remember how the Lord overtook
the old world in their evil deeds, he came upon them as a thief in the night,
when they little thought of him, he took them eating and drinking, Marrying,
and giving in marriage, and he repented that ever he made man upon the Earth,
and he overtu^ned them in his fiery wrath, and in his fiery indignation, he
spared not Jerusalem, wherein his Temple was built; and do thou think that
the Lord will spare thee? I am afraid the Lord will overturn thee in flames of
fire, as he did them in their gain-sayings: Therefore amend thy life while it
is to day, and prize the short moment of time which thou have yet to spend,
least God cast thee into Hell, which is prepared for the wicked and abominable.
And this is my council unto thee, whether thou will receive it, yea or nay: It
is good, and the same which the Apostles gave to the ungodly in that day, and
to the Scribes and Pharisees, who were learned men, whose zeal did far exceed
thine in this thy day; and this is it, that thou return to the Spirit of God
which is in thee, and be guided by it, and led with it, into righteousness,
meekness, and long-suffering, and walk in the light whilst you have the light,
for the night will come, wherein no man can work; but in this glorious day the
Son works, and the Father works, therefore let him not work in vain, but
let the Spirit of the pure God work down, and lead out of all that's contrary to
God, that so life over death may reign in thee. O! that thou were like the
Noble Bereans, that searched the Scripture in their day, and if thou would do
so with the same Spirit that gave them forth, then would thou see clearly
that we are in the way of God, and live the life of the Scriptures, and then
would thou join issue with us, and leave thy dumb idle Shepherds, which
indeed are greedy dumb dogs, and can never have enough, and come to Christ,
whom God has given for a Leader and a Commander to his people, and to be
Salvation to the ends of the earth, who is the Physician and the Bishop of the
soul, who leads into the Fold immortal, where he feeds his Flock at
noonday, in the heat of persecution, and in the day of fiery trials, he is a
sure hiding place, his Name is a strong Tower, the righteous fly thereinto, and
are saved; but as for the wicked, they must inherit the Lake that burn, for
ever, for that's their habitation, which is never-dying torments, which God has
prepared since the Foundation of the earth for them.
