A CENTURY OF Select Psalms, And Portions of the PSALMS of DAVID, Especially

Turned into Meter, and fitted to the usual Tunes in PARISH CHURCHES.

For the use of the Charter House, LONDON.

By JOHN PATRICK, Preacher there.

LONDON, Printed by J. M. for Richard Royston, Bookseller to the Kings Most
Excellent Majesty, at the Angel in Amen-Corner, 1679.

A PREFACE TO THE READER.
WERE it not that the Singing-Psalms, commonly used in Churches, labor under
the Prejudice of an ill Translation, whose dress is course and homely, the
Meter rugged and unequal, being patched up with little care, the words many of
them out of use and scarce intelligible, without fancy, and sometimes, which is
worse, without any sense; I cannot think that any sober devout person, would
decry or slight the singing of them in the Church: wherein though the common
People cannot attain in this, more than in other matters, to much skill or art;
yet however they seem to me to be employed more affectionately in this, than in
any other part of the Service: and considering that praising God is the most
excellent part of it, by the same reason that the Apostle prefers Charity
before Faith and Hope, because when they cease to be of use, this remains for
ever, even in Heaven it self; it may seem very reasonable to afford the people
all furtherance and assistance to the better performance of that, to which they
have already a laudable propension.

I confess there are discouragements to undertake such a work and particularly
that, which some others have deservedly complained of, viz. the ungracefulness
of the Measures of our Common Tunes: which I think happens to have been the
worst chosen of any Meter extant in any Language, and scarce admits, when words
are fitted to them, of any Elegancy; which therefore the Excellent Poets of our
own have balked, and chosen in their Translations, to use Pindaric's or other
measures of their own fancying, wherein without being so much straightened, they
had more scope for their flights and Elegancies. But since the people cannot be
wound up to them, he that intends their benefit, must condescend, and take as
he finds it, the Meter they are accustomed to; and fit such words to them as
they can understand, and may conveigh naturally and easily into their minds,
that pious sense which every where breaths in the Psalms of David. And perhaps
this may be a harder task to do well, than he that has not tried it would
imagine: especially when he must not take leave to Paraphrase largely in
strains of his own, but must keep closely, though not to every word, yet to the
sense of the Text as it lies before him.

This has been attempted I know by many, but I think not so successfully as
might have been wished. For the most have plainly miscarried, by tying
themselves too strictly, I had almost said superstitiously, to the words of the
English Text, which in a Thousand places cannot be made to fall Naturally,
without botching, into verse; so that there is little more of Poetry in them,
than mere Rhyme.

A Reverend Bishop, that saw this fault and avoided it, yet pitched upon an
unlucky method in his Translation, to make every first and second, every third
and fourth line of a Psalm to answer and rhyme to one another; whereby, in the
short measures especially of eight and six feet (which is the common one) he
was too much hampered and confined, so that the words could not fall in so
naturally as they ought; which appears (the better to explain what I mean) even
in the two first lines of the first Psalm, which in his Version are these,

The Man is blessed, whose feet not tread, By wicked Counsels led:
where the Rhyme returning so quick, forced the last word of the first line,
out of its proper order.
Another Ingenious Gentleman since that, bestowed very commendable pains in
this work, but yet (which was great pity) his Version seems to me less fitted
for common use than the former: For though sometimes he may be thought to have
chosen too great bluntness and homeliness of phrase, as if intending to comply
with the vulgar, witness such as these, for instance -- Good Fellows in their
Wine -- Goblin of the Night -- Gates of gaping Death -- Created at a blast. --
Potters brittle Ware. -- Muttons to the Shambles sold. -- Water swell his Guts,
and such like; yet at other times his Phrases, especially his Epithets, are not
to be understood by the vulgar without a Comment: such as these. Libyan Fields.
-- Torrid Climes. Phoenician die. -- Oazy Beds. -- Deaths Carnivals. -- Ophir
Ingots. -- Aromatic Unguents, etc. Very often again (without occasion given by
the Psalm) his phrase is too Poetical, and not befitting the Gravity of the
Subject: for instance in such as these. -- Suns. Western Inn (for his seting)
-- Wind-rockt Cradles, (for Birds Nests) -- Air-fann'd Flames. -- Feathered
shower -- Gray feathered Morn. -- Heavens winged Posts. -- Heavens starry
Canopy, and a great many such like.

When I observed these things, though at first I only intended to make a
Collection of Psalms out of others, for the use of that Society to which I
relate (where we are bound by the Orders of the House, upon Sundays and
Festivals and the Eves of them, to sing the Psalms to an Organ, though without a
Quire) I altered my thoughts, and resolved to try as others had done before me,
so to fit the Psalms to the common Tunes, that the vulgar might bear their part
in them, and the more intelligent and skilful might not have reason to despise
this part of the Service. Which design whether I have performed, I must leave
others to judge; only desiring when they do so, to remember that this was my
end, and not to set up for a Poet.

And now to give the Reader some account of my manner of proceeding herein;
Because (for the reason before given) I resolved not to ty up my self strictly
to the use of the words of the English Text, unless they would fall in
naturally, but rather to clear the phrases by a short Paraphrase, though still
keeping to the sense; I therefore consulted the Critics and other Expositors
upon places of difficulty, and especially the Paraphrases of the Learned Dr
Hammond and Amyraldus. I have endeavored to suit my Version to the strain of
the Psalms, which are very different; some more humble and plain, best suited
to David's afflictive Complaints, plaints, or to those Psalms that instruct men's
manners: Others are more lofty, elegant, and poetical; as when he sets out the
worlds of God, his Creation and Providence, or the perfections of the Almighty
Ruler of the World; or prophetically describes things that relate to the
Messiah. Instances of which may be seen in Psalm 23.29.45. 65.91.93.96.104.139.
not to mention many others.

I foresee two Objections against my method of proceeding; which I shall
briefly endeavor to satisfy. The one is, that I have left so many Psalms
untranslated: the other, that I have taken at other times only some portions of
Psalms, and left out many Verses in those I have translated. In Answer to both
which, I think it may suffice to return; That in the choice I have made, I
considered and pitched upon those Psalms or portions of them, which were most
proper and of most general use to us Christians. Such are Psalms of
Thanksgiving, or of Petition for mercies we all need, or that instruct us in
our Duty. But I balked those whose aspect was upon David's personal troubles, or
Isreal's particular condition, or related to the Jewish and legal Economy, or
are prophetical of the Nations they should subdue, or respected their
deliverances, or such as refer not to us, but by a more difficult
Accommodation; or where they express a temper not so suitable to the mild and
gentle spirit of the Gospel, such as our Savior repressed in his Disciples,
not allowing imprecations of vengeance against our Enemies, but rather praying
for them; especially when that prophetic spirit does not now rest upon us,
that did upon David. So also such Psalms as are of very Artificial contrivance
in the Hebrew, the Verses beginning with the several Letters of the Alphabet,
and the phrases with great Art varied, though containing the same repeated sense,
which cannot be imitated so well in other Tongues, many Verses in them are left
out; as among others in the 37th Psalm; and especially in the 119th Psalm,
which therefore I have contracted into six parts: I might also add, that I have
sometimes omitted a few Verses that preface to a Psalm. If these reasons will
be allowed me, then I suppose there will be very little found either in whole
Psalms or pieces of them, that is not translated. If this satisfy not, I have
only one thing further to offer, which methinks may. That I desire only that I
may have the same favor that is granted to every Parish Clark; who in setting
the Psalms, is not wont to run through them in order, nor to appoint at all
times a whole one to be sung, but only such portions of them as are suitable to
the occasion; or to the time allotted not for this alone, but for other
services to be performed in the Congregation: And if I had said no more, I know
not why I may not take liberty to pick and choose portions of Psalms, as well as
he. I have nothing more to add, unless it be fit to mention, that I have put
very many of the Psalms into the Meter of the Hundred Psalm, which measure, as
well as the Tune, I judge to be the best we have: but for those that may be of
another mind, I have complied so far, as to repeat the far greater number of
such Psalms in the commoner Meter: and that I know but of one only hard word,
that may trouble an ordinary Reader, which he will find in the first line of
the 127th Psalm, viz. the word Architect, which signifies a Master Builder, and
I hope he will not meet with such another throughout the whole work.

IMPRIMATUR,

Nov. 21. 1678. GUIL. JANE.

Psalm I.
[ To the 100. Psalm Tune.]

No wicked Counsels lead aside;
No stands in Sinners ways; nor sits
Where God and Goodness men deride.

Is placed, his Souls entire delight;
On these his mind is fixed by Day,
On these his wakeful thoughts by Night.

Derives his sap and kindly juice;
His Leaves are ever fresh and green,
His Branches timely Fruits produce.
No cross events shall blast his hopes,
Nor spoil the pleasures of his mind;

Like chaff, by every stormy wind.

And vile Hypocrisy for Grace;
Their Guilt, when judged, will find no Plea,
Nor they among the Just a place.

As he approves the ways they tread;
But the smooth Paths of Sinners, down
To Death and to Damnation lead.
Psalm II.

And foolish things surmise;

Rulers his Christ despise?

Their Yoke, his Laws their Chain;
Freedom they will have without control,
No Bonds shall them restrain.

Their vain attempts deride;

Vex their defeated Pride.

Securely on his Throne:

Proclaimed him now my Son.
This is the Birthday of thy Rule,

Over all the Earth; the Gentiles give
For thine inheritance.

Their disobedient Neck;
Like brittle Potsherds, all their powers
Without resistance break.

This greater Lord revere;

And to displease him fear.

Your happiness does lie;
Then you are safe, when he is well pleased;
When he is provoked, ye dye.
Psalm III.

And in my troubles boast?

And my Condition lost?

And on thy Power rely;
Thou shall defend me as a shield,
And list my head on high.

And thou from Heaven did hear;

And waked without all fear.

My courage should not fail;
Though they besieged me, I should be
Secured, or else prevail.

For thou have heretofore
Turned back my Enemies with shame,
And broken all their power.

He still will bless and save;
Then let this Author of their good,
Their cheerful praises have.
Psalm IV.

Of mine Integrity;
Thou have my former troubles eased,
Now to my Prayers draw nigh.

My Government despise;
How long will ye pursue vain hopes,
And please your selves with lies?

With special favor own:
Though you despise me, he never will
On my Petitions frown.

Instruct and make you wise;

As the best Sacrifice.

To other succors fly;
Thou art our hope, Lord, cast on us
A favorable Eye.

Their Corn has wished increase;
Or when a happy Vintage makes
Their Wine overflow the Press.

Shall close my wearied Eyes;
No fears disturb me, whilst I know
In God my safety lies.
Psalm VI.
[ To the 100. Psalm Tune.]

When thou do kindly me chastise;
But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear;
O let not that against me rise.

And tnose perplexities I feel,

O let thy gentler touches heal.

And save my life; for in the Grave

Thankful acknowledgments can have.

In sighs and groans; and when it is night,
I drown my Bed and self in tears:


Are dashed; for this my mournful voice,
Will bring God nearer to mine aid,
When you come flocking to rejoice.


Will vex themselves at their defeat,
And with confusion turn away.
Psalm VI.
[Another Meter.]


Do kindly me chastise;
But thy fierce wrath I cannot bear,
O let it never rise.

Perplexities I feel,

Thy gentler touches heal.

My Life; for in the Grave

Acknowledgments can have.

In groans; and when it is night,
I drown my Bed and self in tears;


Are dashed, my mournful voice
Will bring me help from God, when you
Come flocking to rejoice.

That gaped for a prey;
Vexed at their defeited hopes
With shame shall turn away.
Psalm VIII.

Thy Name is Excellent:
Thy Glory is exalted far
Above the Firmament.

Thy Victories arise;
They still the Triumphs of thy Foes,
And shame thine Enemies.

Raise mine admiring Eye;
And there behold the Moon and Stars
That beautify the Sky:

In thy kind thoughts a place?
Why do thou thus advance and bless
His miserable Race?

He wears a Glorious Crown:

And for their Sovereign own.

Or in the Deserts lie;

And Fowls beneath the Sky;

Disown Gods Government;
Whose Power does rule the World, whose Name
Alone is Excellent.
Psalm IX.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

And all his mighty works proclaim:

Whilst I sing praises to his Name.

Has placed his Throne in glorious Light;

His sentence will be just and right.

He Will be their refuge in distress;

His Prayer never wanted good success.

Declares his Righteousness to all:
They that lay Trains to hurt the good,
Set Traps to occasion their own fall.
Yea Hell the ruin of them waits,
Who God and Justice disregard:
When poor men's wronged Patience
Obtains sure rescue and reward.
Arise, O Lord, and interpose


They are but Men, and so confess.
Psalm IX.
[Another Meter.]


And all his works proclaim;

Sing praises to his Name.

His Throne in glorious light:

His Sentence will be right.

And refuge in distress:

Nor Prayers without success.

His righteousness to all:
They that lay Trains to hurt the good,
Set Traps for their own fall.

And Justice disregard;

Shall find a sure reward.

The wickeds good success:

They Are men, and so confess.
Psalm XI.

By those discouraged be,
Who bid me like a frighted Bird
Unto the Mountains flee?

Have ready bent their bow:

What can the righteous do?

Heaven is his glorious Throne;
From whence he views the Sons of Men,
And judges every one.

He does their works approve;
Such as are wicked and unjust,
His Soul can never love.

This mixture is made up,
Fire, Brimstome, and tempestuous storms,
The portion of their Cup.

In righteousness delight;
And still will favor and protect
The man that is upright.
Psalm XII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Goodness from Earth will fly away;
And faithful men will hardly find
A place, if thou much longer stay.

They Are counted wise that act a part;
Who though their words are smooth and fair,
Intend no kindness in their heart.

And their deceitful arts will shame;
Whose Pride no vengeance fears from God,
And count Religion but a name.

By fraud and falsehood they supply;
And plead for their injurious tongues
An uncontrouled Liberty.
But God who hears the poor man sighs,
And groans of such as are oppressed;
At length will vindicate their cause,
And raise his Power to give them rest.

His faithfulness has often been tried;
Refined Silver's not so free
From dross, though seven times purified.

Thou Lord shall keep the just from harm;

The wicked every where will swarm.
Psalm XII.
[Another Meter.]


Goodness will fly away;
And faithful men will find no place,
If thou much longer stay.

They Are wise that act a part:
Who though their words are smooth, intend
No kindness in their heart.

And all their Arts will shame;
Who fear not Gods Revenge, and count
Religion bur a name.

By falsehood they supply;
And plead for their injurious tongues
Unbounded Liberty.

Of such as are oppressed;
Will vindicate their cause, and raise
His power to give them rest.

His Truth has often been tried;
Silver is not so free from dross,
Though seven times purified.

To keep the just from harm;

On every side will swarm.
Psalm XIV.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

That minds the affairs of men below:
For though they speak it not aloud,
They live as if they thought it so.
Their principles are all corrupt,
Hateful and vile their actions are;
They Are only skilful to do ill,
But from all good estranged far.

Looked down and took a strict survey,
What men did seek and know the Lord,
And did his just Commands obey.

With loathsome wickedness o'regrown;
None were Religious and Just,
Or practiced goodness, no not one.

Like bread thy people thus devour;
Yet neither own thee by their Prayers,
Nor dread the vengeance of thy power.

Terrors shall seize them unawares;
When God appears to help the just,
And punishment for these prepares.


Salvation to his people; then
You shall be sad and they shall sing.
Psalm XIV.
[Another Meter.]


Does mind the affairs below;
For though they speak it not aloud,
They live as if 'twere so.
Their principles are all corrupt,
Their actions hateful are;
They Are skilful only to do ill,
From good estranged far.

And took a strict survey,
What men did seek and know the Lord,
And his just Laws obey.

With loathsome sins o'regrown;
What was Religious, just and good,
None practiced, no not one.

Like Bread the poor devour:
Yet neither own thee by their Prayers,
Nor dread thy mighty power.

Shall seize them unawares:
When God does help the just, for these
Due vengeance he prepares.

But when his power shall bring
Salvation to his people, then
You Will sigh, and they shall sing.
Psalm XV.
LOrd let me know that happy man,
Whom thou so well do love;
That he may praise thee here below,
And dwell with thee above.

Whose works are right and just;
Whose heart and words are true, and whom
One my securely trust.
His Neighbors credit does not wound
By a detracting tongue:
Nor in his Infamy delights;
Much less would do him wrong.

His virtuous Soul does loath;
But shows to such as fear the Lord,
Kindness and honor both.
Who does not break his Oath, when he
To his own damage swears;
But his strict virtue far before
His interest prefers.

Bribes to betray the just:
This man shall never be moved, but may
In God securely trust.
Psalm XVI.

From his rich mercy slows;
And his good Providence secures
The blessings he bestows.

Nor pine to see his store:
With what I have I Am pleased much,
With what I hope for more.

Troubles mine exercise;
Those sad and solitary thoughts
Instruct and make me wise.

My fears are over-blown;
When he stands by me with his aid,
No power shall cast me down.

In him my flesh shall trust;

Nor Body in the Dust.

And in thy presence taste
Pleasures to full perfection grown,
And joys that ever last.
Psalm XIX.

Gods Skill and Power proclaim;

The Night, declare the same.

Nor words to them belong;

Thy praise, without a tongue.

No Bridegroom shows his Face
So cheerful, nor no Champion runs
With so much strength his Race.

His course unto the West:
All the Earth rejoices in his light,
And by his heat is blessed.

Our errors this descries;
Sinners to goodness this converts,
And makes the simple wise.

His just Commands accord:
Their joys are pure, and to the Soul
Both Food and Light afford.
Part. II.

And keep them pure and bright:
Thy Judgments are exactly true,
And altogether right.

With finest Gold are filled:
Sweeter than Honey, and the drops
From Honey-Combs distilled.

My prosperous state I own;
And in observing these shall gain
Rewards that are unknown.

What man can call to mind?
Lord, let those faults thy pity move,
And easy pardon find.

Enslave my Soul to sin:
So shall I blameless innocence
Maintain, and peace within.

A pleasing Sacrifice
To thee, my God, in whom my strength
And my Salvation lies.
Psalm XXI.

With thy Salvation blessed!

And granted his request.

A splendid Crown he wears;

To' innumerable years.

With Majesty arrayed:

And in thy favor glad.

Whose grace will make him stand:

The Terror of thy hand.



But could not bring about.

Thy killing Arrows aim;

Will sing and praise thy Name.
Psalm XXII.

Shall in thy Church be paid;
Before thy Saints those vows performed,
That in distress I made.

Thy goodness shall supply:
Thou shall revive their fainting hopes,
That on thy strength rely.

Shall turn unto the Lord;
By all the Kindreds of the Earth
His name shall be adored.

Princes their Sceptres sway;
All Nations pay him homage, and
His powerful Rule obey.

And they that to the Grave
Descend, shall bow to him; for none
His Soul alive can save.

Declare his Righteousness;

His Mercies same no less.
Psalm XXIII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

That all my wants be still supplied;
I shall not be exposed to wrong,
Nor left to stray without a Guide.

Where I have case and sweet repast:
The streams are cool and quiet, where
I quench my thirst and please my taste.

Life's tedious journey pleasant make;
And in the peaceful ways of Grace
He leads me, for his goodness sake.

And sorrow casts a dismal shade;
Thy Power and thy tender care
Would chase my fears, and make me glad.

Behold thy Bounty, and repine
To see rich Oils anoint my Head,
And see my Cup overflow with Wine.

Shall still surround me all my days:
I will frequent thy House, and there
Display thy Love, and sing thy praise.
Psalm XXIII.
[Another Meter.]


I to his flock belong:
I shall not stray without a Guide,
Nor be exposed to wrong.

Where I have food and ease:
He leads me to the quiet streams
Where I my thirst appease.

Life's journey pleasant make;
He guides me in his righteous paths,
For his own Goodness sake.

Reflects a dismal shade;
Thy Rod and Staff would chase away
My fears, and make me glad.

My Table, who repine
To see rich Oils anoint my Head,
My Cup overflow with Wine.

Shall Crown my future days;
I will frequent his House, to show
His Love, and sing his praise.
Psalm XXIV.

All Creatures it contains;
His gracious care to all the World
Extends, over which he Reigns.

The Earths great Fabric lay;
And on the unstable Floods, he made
Her fixed Foundations stay.

Who shall admitted be?
Lord, who within thy holy place,
May stand and worship thee?

Whose heart no stains defile;
whose tongue blasphemes not God, nor swears
His Neighbor to beguile.

Their free approaches make;
God hears their Prayers, and they are sure
His blessings to partake.

Be open and make room;
Lift up your Heads, and you shall see
The King of Glory come.

And who is this Glorious King?
It is the Mighty Lord of Hosts,
Who does Salvation bring.
Psalm XXV.

In him my trust repose;

Or triumph to my Foes.

Their Souls that wait on thee;
Let disappointments shame their hopes,
That deal perfidiously.

Make me to know aright;
And teach me always to perform
What Is pleasing in thy sight.

Never let me go astray;
From thee, my Savior, I beg
Direction every day.

Ever of old expressed;
How thou have graciously relieved
Thy Servants, when distressed.

No strict inquiry make;
Those early faults, O Lord, forgive,
For thine own goodness sake.
Part. II.

Will erring Souls instruct;
Their wandering steps to the safe paths
Of Virtue will conduct.

And teach the meek his way;

As his just Laws obey.

For mercy I entreat;
Pardon my Sins, O Lord, that are
Both numerous and great.

That fears the Lord above?
He Will ever lead him in the ways
That he himself does love.

His Soul shall dwell at ease;
His Seed shall after him enjoy
Prosperity and Peace.

God will make known to those
That fear him, and the blessings he
Reserves, to them disclose.
Part. III.

Mine Eyes are toward thee;
I hope thy goodness at the last
From all will set me free.

To me, and mercy show;
Great are the afflictions I endure,
And find no help below.

Lord send me quick relief;

And then remove my grief.

In number still increase;
How they with causeless hatred seek
The ruin of my Peace.

From shame as well as guilt;
O never disappoint the hopes
That I on thee have built.

Find sure supports from thee;
At length thy chosen people, Lord,
From all their troubles free.
Psalm XXVI.

My Souls integrity:
Nothing shall shake my Confidence,
Whilst I on thee rely.

To thine impartial Eye;
O try my heart, least any sin
Should there concealed lie.

Gives me the best delight:
This both engages and excites
My care to walk aright.

Free from impurity;
And then the Oblations I present,
Shall acceptable be.

Thy goodness will proclaim;
And tell of all thy wondrous works,
To magnify thy Name.
Psalm XXVII.

An answer full of grace:

Resolve to seek thy face.

Thy face, nor me reject;
Those succors I have had before,
From thee I still expect.

As thine, nor care so large;
When they forsake me, I become
Still more thy care and charge.

Where I may safely tread;
Avoiding all the cunning snares
Mine Enemies have laid.

With troubles was oppressed,
Had I not hoped thy mercy would
Secure my Peace and Rest.

Courage and Strength derive;
Though he delay, he will at length
Thy fainting heart revive.
Psalm XXVIII.

When I thy succor crave;
Else I shall be like them that lie
Neglected in the Grave.

To those requests I made;

His seasonable aid.
Thy favor, Lord, has made my heart
Exceedingly rejoice;
In grateful Hymns I will advance
Thy praise with cheerful voice.

God will protect and own;
And his Anointed save, whom he
Has raised to his Throne.

Do all their safety owe;
Feed thou thy Flock, and raise them up
When they are fallen low.
Psalm XXIX.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Ye Rulers of the World proclaim;

The Honor due unto his Name.

Through all the Regions of the Sky;
The Clouds are frighted with the noise,


And break before the mighty sound;

And like a frighted Calf rebound.

Of pointed Lightnings tear the air,

Think they are not safe, but quake for fear.

Wild Beasts the naked Thickets leave;
But in his sacred Temple all
Fearless to God their praises give.

To Clouds above and Floods below;

Will rest and Peace on his bestow.
Psalm XXX.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Thee I Will extol with thankful voice;
Who have secured me from those harms,
That would have made my Foes rejoice.

To thee I cried, and thou did save;

My Life did rescue from the Grave.

Proclaim the praises of the Lord;
His goodness often call to mind,
And his Fidelity record.

Which is our Life, does longer stay;
Grief may continue for a night,
But comfort rises with the day.

My Sackcloth now is thrown away;
And gladness girds me, who before
In black despair and horror lay.

But to the Lord due glory give;
And strive that in thy thankful Verse
His same Eternally may Live.
Psalm XXX.
[ Another Meter.]

My God with thankful voice;
Who freed me from those harms, that would
Have made my Foes rejoice.

I cried, and thou did save:

Did rescue from the Grave.

The praises of the Lord;
His goodness call to mind; and his
Fidelity record.

Our Life, does longer stay:
Weeping may for a Night endure,
But joy comes with the Day.

My Sackcloth's thrown away;
Gladness surrounds me, who before
In dismal sorrows lay.

To God due praise give;
That in thy thankful verse, his same
Eternally may Live.
Psalm XXXII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

And hides what he has done amiss;

Whose heart sincere and upright is.

My guilt, no quiet I could get;

And scorched me like the Summers heat.

My crimes, and open all my wound;
I humbly did confess my sins
To thee, and easy pardon found.

In season to implore thine aid;
Then though their troubles like a Flood
Should rise, they need not be afraid.

To thee I Will fly in all distress;
Thou will preserve me; and in Songs
Of Victory I Will thee confess.


Whose fury, till they are broke and tamed,
No Rein can guide, no Curb can rule.


The happy men: then let the Just
Rejoice and triumph in his Love.
Psalm XXXII.
[ Another Meter.]

And hides what is done amiss:

Sincere and upright is.

No quiet 1 could get:

Scorched me like Summers heat.

My Crimes, and ope' my wound:
I humbly did confess my sins,
And easy pardon found.

Good men to implore thy aid:
Then though the Floods of Trouble rise,
They need not be afraid.

I Will fly in all distress;
Thou will preserve me; and my Songs
Thy mercies shall confess.

Be like the Horse or Mule;

Can guide, no Curb can rule.

That trust in God, shall prove
The happy men: then let them joy
And Triumph in his Love.
Psalm XXXIII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

And let his praise be your delight;
For praise is lovely, and becomes
The lips of those that are upright.

His Laws from all injustice free;
His promise sure, and all his works
Are done in Truth and Equity.

His favor, and his pleasure are;
The Earth with various blessings filled,
To us his kindness does declare.

By his commanding word were made;
And all its numerous Hosts, from his
Creating breath their beings had.

To which they are confined, keep;
Whose Waters safely are laid up
In the great Storehouse of the deep.

Let fear and due regard be shown;
May all the World his awful power
By humble adorations own.
Part. II.

That God his chosen Ruler is;
And happy they! whom God declares
By's special care, that they are his.

Looks down from his Celestial Throne;

Views from his glorious Mansion.

Their hearts he fashioned one by one;
And all their inmost thoughts, to him
Better than to themselves, are known.

Looks with a favorable Eye;
He never will fail their hopes, that on
His goodness steadfastly rely.

Our succor and our sure defense;

In thee with cheerful confidence.

Descend, like a refreshing shower;
As all our hope and joy depends
Upon thy favor and thy power.
Psalm XXXIII.
[ Another Meter.]

And praise him with delight:
For thankfulness becomes the lips
Of those that are upright.

Are from injustice free;
His promise sure; and all his ways
Are Truth and Equity.

As they his pleasure are;
The Earth with Blessings filled, to us
His goodness does declare.

Commanding word were made:
And from his Breath its numerous Hosts
Their several Beings had.

Confined limits keep;
Whose Waters are laid up within
The Store house of the deep.

Let due regard be shown:
May all the World his awful power
By humble worship own.
Part. II.

That God his Ruler is;
And happy they! whom God declares
By's Care, that they are his.

From his Celestial Throne;

From his bright Mansion.

He fashioned one by one.
More clearly all their thoughts to him,
Than to themselves are known.

Looks with a Gracious Eye:
And never will fail their hopes, that on
His Goodness do rely.

Our help and our defense:

With cheerful confidence.

Like a refreshing shower;
For all our hope and joys depend
On thine Almighty Power.
Psalm XXXIV.

I will at all times bless;
My tongue shall daily be employed
His goodness to confess.

Shall hear it, and rejoice;

Join both in heart and voice.

And graciously he heard;
His timely succors did prevent
The threatening harm I feared.

Yet wait to encompass such
As fear him, to preserve them safe
When dangers near approach.

And then confess you must,
That God is good, and they are blessed
That in his goodness trust.
Part. II.

And happy days would see?

Deceit and Injury.

From doing good never cease;
Seek all men's quiet, and pursue
The things that make for peace.

He casts a gracious Eye;
His Ear's attentive to their suits
And open to their cry.

And case their troubles have;

And contrite spirits save.

At length God sets them free;

No bone shall broken be.

With all that hate the Just;

Their hopes that on him trust.
Psalm XXXVI.

Thy mercy, Lord, extends;
Thy faithfulness the narrow bounds
Of space and time transcends.

Thy truth shall fail the least;
Thy judgments none can fathom; thou
Preservest Man and Beast.

God bears unto the just;
Under whose Providence and care
Good men securely trust.

For all supplies shall look;
And freely of thy pleasures drink
As from a running Brook.

Derived are from thee;
From thy continued favor flows
All our Felicity.

Thy kindness still impart;
And all thy promises fulfill
To men of upright heart.
Psalm XXXVII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

The wickeds prosperous Estate;
Nor, tempted by their good success,
Grow bold their Crimes to imitate.

Before the Mower cuts it down;
And beauteous Flowers, within a while
Are withered by the scorching Sun.

And on Gods goodness, does rely;

And all thy just desires supply.

In firm dependence on him live;
He Will either grant what thou would have,
Or what he knows is better give.

Like Clouds, thy Righteousness obscure;
He Will clear thy Innocence, the Light
At Noon shall not appear more pure.

That little which contents the poor,
Is better far, than wicked men's
Ill got or ill-employed store.
Part. II.

And he delights in his way;

Gods power is his support and stay.

That Liberal man I never could see,
Whose Alms exposed himself to want,
Or brought his Race to Beggary.

And thus his Seed a blessing gain;

Do good and from all sin abstain.

Those that are like himself will own;
They shall continue; when the race
Of wicked men is overthrown.

Flourish like Laurels ever green;

And no remainder could be seen.

And him that is upright in his ways;
Mercy attends his happy life,
And quiet peace concludes his days.
Psalm XXXVII.
[ Another Meter.]

The wickeds prosperous State;
Nor by their good success grow hold
Their crimes to imitate.

The Mower cuts it down;
And beauteous Flowers within a while
Are withered by the Sun.

Gods goodness does rely;

Thy just desires supply.

Dependence on him live;
He Will either grant what thou would have,
Or what is better give.

Thy Righteousness obscure;
He Will clear thy innocence, the light
Shall not appear more pure.

For what contents the poor,
Is better than Bad men's ill-got
Or ill-imployed store.
Part. II.

Delights in his way;

Gods power will be his stay.

That liberal man could see;
Whose Alms exposed himself to want,
Or Race to Beggary.

His Seed a blessing gain;

And from all sin abstain.

That him resemble own;
They shall continue, when the Race
Of Bad men is overthrown.

Like Laurels fresh and green;

No remnant could be seen.

That Is upright in his ways;
Mercy attends his happy life,
And peace concludes his days.
Psalm XXXIX.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

And number of my days I view;
To measure right my self and them,
How I am frail, and they are few.

Mine age is nothing unto thee;
Man in his flourishing estate
Is altogether vanity.

But his vexations real are;
He heaps up wealth, and knows not who
Shall reap the profit of his care.

How kind the flattering World will prove;
I Will seek my God alone to please,
And be ambitious of his Love.

When God for sin does man chastise!
Like Garments fretted by the moth,
So all his beauty ruined lies.

And to my mournful cry give Ear;
A wandering stranger here on Earth
I am, as all my Fathers were.

And spare me yet a while, that I
May make my peace with thee, before
I go away from hence, and dye.
Psalm XXXIX.
[Another Meter.]


I have to live, I view;
To know my self and them, how frail
I am, and they are few.

Is nothing unto thee;
When man is in his best estate,
He Is only vanity.

Vexations real are;
Gets wealth, but knows not who shall reap
The profit of his care.

How kind the World will prove;
I Will seek to please my God, and be
Ambitious of his Love.

For sin does Man chastise;
Like Garments fretted by the moth,
His Beauty ruined lies.

And to my cry give Ear;
I am a Stranger here on Earth,
As all my Fathers were.

Me yet a while, that I
May make my peace with thee, before
I go from hence, and dye.
Psalm XL.

And on the Lord rely;
When other succors failed, to him
I prayed, who heard my cry.

Surrounded with despair;
Am safely placed above my fears,
And firm my goings are.

To God, that set me free;
Whilst this thy goodness does invite
Others to trust in thee.

And can the proud despise!
With the deceitful arts of such
As turn aside to lies.
Part. II.

To us so many are;
If I would tell them, they exceed
My thoughts and value far.

No longer grateful were;
And when obedience thou before
Burnt Offerings did prefer;

Thy Sacred Books recite;

To do thy will delight.

How great thy Mercies are;
Thy Truth and Faithfulness, my tongue
To publish shall not spare.

How true thou art and kind;
And those compassions I proclaim,
Lord, let me ever find.
Psalm XLI.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Is touched with another grief;
Who when he hears the poor man's cry,
Affords him pity and relief.
God will his Charity repay,
In time of need will be his Friend;
When troubles to his Lot shall fall,
He Will make them have an happy end.

His Life he will rescue from the Grave;
Prosper his State on Earth; and from
His Foes and all their malice save.

Of languishing infirmity;
Secure of Gods compassions,
His weary Limbs will softer lie.

I cried for pity and for ease;
Lord let thy mercies heal my Soul,
Whose sins are only less than these.

Whom all true Worshippers adore;
Let every Age consent, and say
Amen, till time shall be no more.
Psalm XLII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

For thee I long, to thee I look;
No chased Heart does pant so much
After the cooling Water-brook.

From mine own House, than, Lord, from thine;
Oh how I wish to approach that place,
Where all thy Glories use to shine.

Increase, and tears become my food;
Whilst mine insulting Foes reproach
My Faith, and say, where is now thy God?

How to thine House in Troops we came;
What cheerful Feasts we kept, and sang
Praises in consort to thy name.

Whence naught but perturbation flows?
Since you procure not what I wish,
Why should you hinder my repose?
I Have learnt the Remedy at last;
To keep my Passions calm and still;
I Am nearer help by hope in God
And resignation to his will.
Psalm XLII.
[Another Meter.]


I long, to thee I look;
No chased Heart does pant so much
After the Water-brook.

From mine own House, than thine;
Oh how I wish to approach the place,
Where all thy Glories shine!

And tears become my food;
To hear my Foes reproach my Faith,
And say, where is now thy God?

How to thine House we came
In Troops to Feast, and praises sang
In consort to thy name.

Whence naught but trouble flows?
Since you procure not what I wish,
Hinder not my repose.
I Have learnt this Remedy, to keep
My Passions calm and still:
I Am nearer help by hope in God,
And a resigned will.
Psalm XLIII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Be thou my gracious Advocate;
And clear mine Innocence from those
Whose craft is equal to their hate.

On which alone my Soul relies?
And look not on my mournful state,
Oppressed by cruel Enemies?

That by the conduct of thy Light
Thy Courts I may attain, and there
May have of thee a fuller sight.

My Spirit, and all my gladness raise:
Where I thy goodness would proclaim
With all the Instruments of praise.

Whence naught but perturbation flows?
Since they procure not what I wish,
Why should they hinder my repose?
I Have learnt this Remedy at last,
To keep my Passions calm and still;
I Am nearer help by hope in God,
And resignation to his will.
Psalm XLIII.
[Another Meter.]


My gracious Advocate;
To plead my cause against those, whose craft
Is equal to their hate.

On which my Soul relies?
And look not on my state oppressed
By cruel Enemies?

That, guided by thy Light,
I may attain thy Courts, and have
Of thee a fuller sight.

My Soul, my joys would raise:
Where I thy goodness would proclaim
With instruments of praise.

Whence naught but trouble flows?
Since you procure not what I wish,
Hinder not my repose.
I Have learnt this Remedy, to keep
My passions calm and still;
I Am nearer help by hope in God,
And a resigned will.
Psalm XLV.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Created Beauties does outshine;
All graces on thy Lips are powered,
On thee Eternal Blessings showered.

The Ornament of Majesty;
Like an illustrious Prince appear,
And show how great thy Glories are.

The Virtues that adorn thy train;
Wronged Meekness, Truth and Equity
Look only for support from thee.
Thine Enemies amazed stand,
Struck with the Terror of thy hand;
Who needs must fall, since thy keen Darts
Will find a passage to their hearts.

Thy Kingdom ever shall endure;
Thy Laws, the Scepter in thy hand,
Oppress not those whom they command.

Therefore thy Glories far above
Thy Fellows shine; thy God has shed
More Oil of Gladness on thy head.
Psalm XLVI.

The strength whereby we stand;
When troubles their approaches make,
His help is nigh at hand.

Though the Earth should be displaced;
Or though into the Seas vast gulf
The Mountains should be cast.

A frightful noise should make;
Should rise and swell unto the Clouds,
And cause the Hills to shake.

The City of the Lord;

And timely help afford.

But God is on our side;

And daunts their swelling pride.

The Sword out of its sheath;
Which, while he gives it leave, triumphs
In slaughter and in death.

Destructive Wars to cease;
He breaks their Arms, the Bow and Spear,
And crowns the Earth with Peace.

Whose power is over all;
For fear lest he exalt himself
In your unpittied fall.
Psalm XLVII.

And make a cheerful noise;
With Acclamations to your God
Declare your inward joys.

Him greatly to be feared;
This King of all the World commands
Your honor and regard.

Is gone above the Skies;
Trumpets proclaim our joys, and all
Applaud his Victories.

Sing praises to our King;

With understanding sing.

And in that Throne is placed,
Where he in Glory sits, and thence
Shall judge the World at last.
Psalm XLIX.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Affright himself with needless fear,
To see the approaches of old Age,
Or that unwelcome Death draws near?





With Fools together mingled lie;
The rich, though loath to go, must leave
The World with all their wealth, and dye.

Their Fame eternally shall stand;
And, to preserve their Memory,
Give their own names unto their Land.

Makes all their splendid Titles, fade;

The Follies and mistakes they made.

And Beauty shall consume away;
And in Deaths fold enclosed shall lie,
Till the great Resurrection Day.
A Day, wherein the Just shall reign,
And over the Bad Dominion have;

After I Am raised from the Grave.
Part. II.

Or honored here; for when he dies,

And stripped of all his Glory lies.

And other men are apt to praise
His prudent management, that strives
His Wealth or Family to raise;

The Path his Fathers went before;
And in the place where now he dwells,
Never see light or comfort more.

And with true wisdom is not blessed,
Though pleased with false and flattering hopes,
Shall die and perish like a Beast.
Psalm XLIX.
[Another Meter.]


Affright himself with fear,
To see old Age approach, or when
Unwelcome Death draws near?





Together blended lie;
The rich, though loath, must leave the World
With all their wealth, and die.

Their Fame shall ever stand;
And that their names may not be lost,
They give them to their Land.

Makes all their Titles fade;

All the mistakes they made.

And Beauty fades away:
And there shall lie enclosed, till
The Resurrection Day.
Then shall the Just men reign, and over
The bad Dominion have;

When raised from the Grave.
Part. II.

Or rich; for when he dies,

Of all his Glory lies.

And men are apt to praise
That prudent management, which wealth
And Families does raise;

Where others went before,
And never, where he now must dwell,
See light or comfort more.

True wisdom is not blessed;
Though pleased with flattering hopes, shall die,
And perish like a Beast.
Psalm LI.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

That unto thee for mercy flies;
As thy Compassions boundless are,
So blot out mine iniquities.

For thou alone can make me clean:

Amazed to see how vile I Have been.

But thy Tribunal, Lord, I fear;
For if arraigned and judged by thee,
I must be cast, and thou be clear.

Too prone and bent to do amiss;

And truth of heart most pleasing is.

As those with Hyssop sprinkled know
They are absolved; thy Grace can wash
And make me whiter than the Snow.

And inward peace that once I had;
Thy pard'ning voice would heal again
My broken Bones, and make them glad.

With a severe and angry look;
Oh take their stains out of my Soul,
And blot their guilt out of thy Book.
Part. II.

Clean and unspotted in thy sight;
Renew a well composed mind,
Unmoved from goodness, and upright.

As one whom thou no more can love;
Nor let thy Spirit, whose grace I need,
Though grieved too much, from me remove.

TO uphold my feeble powers, afford;

Their ways, and turn unto the Lord.

Of blood, that sin of Crimson die;
I Will then thy faithfulness proclaim,
And loudly sing thy Clemency.


Than costly Sacrifice of Beasts,
Consumed wholly in the fire.

Do more than bloody offerings prise;
This present now I humbly make,
Which God, I trust, will not despise.
Psalm LI.
[Another Meter.]


To thee for Mercy flies;
Thy Mercy boundless is, blot out
All mine iniquities.

Alone can make me clean,

To see how vile I Have been.

Thy Sentence, Lord, I fear;
If judged by thee, I know I must
Be cast, and thou be clear.

Too prone to do amiss;

To thee most pleasing is.

Whom Hyssop sprinkles, know
They are absolved; thy Grace can wash,
And make me white as snow.

And peace that once I had;
Thy voice would heal my broken Bones,
Thy Pardon make them glad.

With a displeased look;
Oh take their stains out of my Soul,
Their Guilt out of thy Book.
Part. II.

Unspotted in thy sight;
Renew in me a mind unmoved
From goodness, and upright.

As one thou can not love;
Nor let thy Spirit, though grieved too much,
Its grace from me remove.

My feeble powers afford;

And turn unto the Lord.

That sin of Crimson die;
Then I Will proclaim thy faithfulness,
And sing thy Clemency.

For this thou do desire

Consumed in the Fire.

More than all offerings prise;
This present now I humbly bring,
Which God will not despise.
Psalm LIII.
[ As the 25. Psalm.]

Does mind the affairs below;
For though they speak it not aloud,
They live as if 'twere so.
All are corrupt and vile,
Their actions hateful are;
They Are only skilful to do ill,
From good estranged far.

And took a strict survey,
What men did seek and know the Lord,
And his just Laws obey.

With loathsome sins o're-grown,
What was Religious, just and good,
None practiced, no not one.

Like Bread the poor devour;
And neither own thee by their Prayers,
Nor dread thy mighty power.

Great terrors feis'd them there;
God that despised them made their fall
As shameful as their fear.

Be with deliverance Crowned;
When thy Salvation shall appear,
Their joys shall then abound.
Psalm LVII.

Mercy to me extend;
I fly for shelter to thy Wings,
Till all my troubles end.

In my distress I Will cry;
Since thou have saved me heretofore,
Thy help will still be nigh.

My ruin was prepared;
Their Pits occasioned their own fall,
Their Nets themselves ensnared.

And this my tongue shall raise;

A Consort to thy praise.

I Will to the World proclaim;
The scattered Nations shall assist
My Songs, to spread thy fame.

Thy Truth unto the Skies;

Both Earth and Heaven rise.
Psalm LXII.
[ As the 25. Psalm.]

My Rock and my defense;

For safety comes from thence.

What time you are afraid;
He Will be your refuge in distress,
When you implore his aid.

Are vain; great men a lie;
Both, in the balance laid, appear
Lighter than vanity.

And trust in this is vain;
Then seek not by oppressive arts,
Or fraud to increase your gain.
If riches should abound
By Heavens blessing sent;
Take heed they do not gain your hearts,
Or make you insolent.

Their help they should derive;
Thou, Lord, have ost declared, that power
Is thy Prerogative.

Of mercy flow from thee;
So that according to men's works
Their due reward shall be.
Psalm LXIII.

Thy Mercy does implore;
No Travellour in desert Lands
Can thirst for Water more.

Within thy holy place,
Thy Power and Glory to behold,
And to partake thy Grace.

No relish does afford;
No other joys can equal this,
To serve and praise the Lord.

And bless thee whilst I live;

Both food and pleasure give.

Present thee to my mind;
And in the night I think how good
My God has been, and kind.

To thee alone I fly;
And on thy watchful providence
With cheerfulness rely.

Do threaten me in vain;
When I keep close to God, his care
And Power will me sustain.
Psalm LXV.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]
Sion wait for thee,
And there the Vow performed shall be.

All flesh shall cheerfully repair,

To all that good from thee we hope;
Thy Mercy does those fears allay,
For this will purge our sins away.

To thee, and in thy Courts appear;
For these shall all refreshments have,
Thy House can give, or they can crave.

Thy kindness to the good do show;
The ends of the Earth in thee confide,
And the Isles that in the Sea reside.

Gain from thy strength stability;

And stills the peoples madder rage.
Part. II.

Thy works of power and anger dread;
And all adore thy goodness great,
Where e're the Sun does rise or set.

Thou visitest the thirsty Earth;
Showrs to enrich her barren Womb
From thy full Springs above do come.
Thy Bounty does that food provide,
By which our needs are all supplied.

Watered with showrs, are soft and yield.
Its Furrows settled and deprest,
Its Spring by after Rains is blessed.

And plenty from the Clouds drop down,

Though parched before, now Springs again:
The little Hills new Garments wear,
And in their youthful green appear.

The Vales are covered over with grain.
All nature seems to shout and sing,
To welcome in the hopeful Spring.
Psalm LXVI.

To God their voices raise;

Him glorious by their praise.

Such terror does appear;
As makes his Foes to crouch, and feign
Obedience through their fear.

And sing unto thy name:

To raise and spread thy Fame.

The swelling Flood made way
For Israel to pass; who there
His glories did display.

Does over the World extend;
Then let not men rebel; for pride
Will in their ruin end.

And loudly sing thy praise,

And Guide of all our ways.
Part. II.

And thankful offerings lay

I made in trouble, pay.

Does come, I Will spare no cost;
I Will offer what he does require,
And what will please him most.

What God for me has done;
His mercies showed to me, will be
For your instruction.

My fervent cries did raise;
He heard me graciously, and turned
My sighing into praise.

Iniquity regard:

And my Petitions heard.

Be ever magnified;
Who neither did reject my Prayer,
Nor his own Grace denied.
Psalm LXVII.

Bless us with gifts divine;
O let the Glories of thy face,
On us thy Servants shine.

Thy fear on Earth abound;
And thy Salvation over all
The Heathen World resound.

Their grateful thoughts express;
Let all the people round the World
Thy mighty Name confess.

Their joys, since God does reign;
He rules with wisdom, this great Judge
Will righteousness maintain.

Their grateful thoughts express;
Let all the people round the World
Thy mighty Name confess.

With Plenty overflow:
And God on all his other gifts,
His blessing will bestow.

Our happy days shall crown;
His power and greatness all the World
With humble fear shall own.
Psalm LXVIII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

His scattered Foes will flee for fear;

Before the Fire, when he draws near.


He rides on High above the Clouds,
Let him be raised too in your Songs.


He for the desolate provides,
But plagues the Rebels land with drought.

From Egypt, with a mighty hand;
And led'st them through the Wilderness,
To bring them to the promised land;

The Earth did with thy Thunder quake;
Mount Sinai, when the Lord came down,
Did from its firm foundation shake.

Like Guards took up their Station there;
Gods special presence was declared,
When these Attendants did appear.
Part. II.

Ascended is above the Skies;
And after him in triumph draws,
As spoils, his Captived Enemies.
He scattered his various gifts
Around, to make his Bounty known;
Even Rebels had a share, amongst whom
He dwells, and they his kindness own.

On us, and he shall have our Songs;

The Power of Life and Death belongs.

The heads of all that him resist;
On whom no methods of his Love
Prevail, but still in sin persist.


From thence he Thunders with his voice,
Which every Creature dreads that hears.

Illustriously to Israel shown;
Its wonders in the Heavens appear,
And thence by all the World is known.

In holy places, are amazed;
It Is God that gives strength and power
Unto his Saints. His Name be praised.
Psalm LXX.
[ As the 25. Psalm.]

How they with haste advance;
O do not stay, but come as fast
To my deliverance.

Their own confusion meet:
When they attempt my hurt, with shame
Be forced to retreat.

Their sport, unpittied be;
Those that deride my trust in God,
Reward with infamy.

That seek their God to please,
Thy favor toward them express,
And make their joys to increase.
Let those that hope in thee,
And thy Salvation love,
Ever occasion have to say,
Praised be God above.

With misery and grief;
Thou art my Savior and my help;
Lord send me quick relief.
Psalm LXXI.
[ As the 25. Psalm.]

Let none disgrace my trust;

As thou art good and just.

Whereto I may resort;
Make good thy gracious promise, Lord,
Be thou my Rock and Fort.

And those that are unjust;
Thou, Lord, alone have been my hope,
And from my youth, my Trust.

When my first breath I drew;
Thou have sustained me ever since,
All praise to thee is due.

On me, as one forlorn;

I shall confute their scorn.

And when my years decline,
Do not forsake or cast me off,
But own me still for thine.

Thee with more praises crown;

Whose measures are unknown.
Part. II.

But to the strength divine:
No other goodness shall be named,
Or faithfulness, but thine.

And hitherto declared
Thy wondrous works. Forsake me not

Till I have further shown
Thy power, and taught thy fear,
Both to the present age, and those
That after shall appear.

Thy works illustrious are;
All thy perfections have no bounds,
None can with thee compare.

My Soul, with grief deprest;

Comfort and give me rest.

I Will all my Powers raise;
And to improve my Songs, will add
Sweet instruments of praise.

Shall loudly bear a part
In praising thee, when set on work
By a most thankful heart.

To celebrate thy fame;
Who have redeemed me, and brought
Mine Enemies to shame.
Psalm LXXIII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

To those that are sincerely good;

My feet did stagger where I stood.

My envy at those Fools did rise;

A quiet Death should close their Eyes.

That others seek to escape in vain;

And Pride surrounds them like a Chain.

Their Body thrives, looks fat and fair;
Their wealth rolls in with a full tide,
Beyond their hopes, without their care.

Oppressive courses without shame;

And freely blast the good man's name.

And passion makes his tears to flow;

Discerns or minds things done below.

Thrive in the World and riches gain;

And cleans'd my heart, says he, in vain.

And I whole days in sorrow spend.

The Faith of all good men offend.
Part. II.

The unequal ways of Providence;
I found them hard to be resolved,
And doubts long kept me in suspense.

And there did my mistakes amend;
Before I only viewed their way,
But now I understood their end.

On which their tottering feet were placed;

When down to sudden ruin cast.

Or shade that quickly vanishes;



By thee sustained, though suffering;

And afterward to Glory bring.

On whom I can rely, like thee;

My stay and Portion thou will be.

Or unto hateful Idols bow,
Shall surely their own ruin meet,
And a deserved overthrow.

To keep me to my God most nigh;
Then I his Mercy and his Truth
Shall praise, when I on him rely.
Psalm LXXXII.
[ As the 113. Psalm.]

Gods Name, and represent him here,
Know that this Judge among you sits.

Or countenance a wicked cause,
Your guiltiness no Plea admits.

The poor, and your assistance lend
To helpless men that Justice crave.

Obnoxious only by their need,
And from the Oppressors Power save.

Who Will know no other right but gain,
Whose Eyes are blind by Bribes you take.
Thus Justice cannot find its course,
But Laws neglected lose their force,
And all the Lands Foundations shake.

And fall, though Sons of the Most High,


Fallen Justice then will rise again,
When God does sit upon his Throne.
Psalm LXXXIV.

Thy presence, Lord, do grant!

Impatient of restraint!

Enjoy, which I Am denied;
Near to thine Altars they prepare
Their Nests, and there reside.

Thine House, to praise thee still;

Devout affections fill.

My Prayer to thee address;

And thine Anointed bless.

Yield me not such content,
As one days freedom at thy House,
And in thy service spent.
There let me have the meanest place,
And at the Threshold lie;
Rather than all the wickeds state
Without this liberty.

We Light and Life derive;
A Shield for our defense, and he
Will Grace and Glory give.
No good will he withold, from him
That Is upright in his way.

His only trust and stay.
Psalm LXXXV.
[ As the 113. Psalm.]


And all their sins are done away.

Is now removed and flames no more;





Which God will to his Saints express,
If they return to sin no more.

To such as thee sincerely fear,
And glory to our Land will bring.

Justice and Peace each other greet,

From Heaven shall righteousness look down;

Our Land with Plenty shall overflow.
When Righteousness prepares his way,
Justice with us shall longer stay,
And Mercy tread where this does go.
Psalm LXXXVI.

Though poor and in the dust;

In thee alone I trust.

And hear my mournful voice,

Oh make it to rejoice.

To pardon sins inclined;
And all that humbly thee implore,
Shall plenteous mercy find.

In hope thou wilst attend;

A gracious answer send.

And talk of Powers Divine:
There Is none that can compare with thee,
Nor any works like thine.

Their Maker shall adore;
Shall glorify thy Name, O Lord,
And celebrate thy Power.

What wonders thou have done;
Their Idols they will disown; and say,
That thou art God alone.
Part. II.

Of truth I never may err;
My loose affections so unite,
That I thy name may fear.

His glories ever tell;

Freed from the lowest Hell.

To punish Sinners slow;
Goodness and faithfulness from thee
Abundantly do flow.

And strength from thee I crave;
From all designed mischiefs, Lord,
Thy humble servant save.

Which all my Foes may see,
And at their malice blush; when thou
Do help and comfort me.
Psalm LXXXIX.

Thy truth to all proclaim;

Shall celebrate the same.

Nor his Commands contest;

With awful fear possessed.

Or girt with Truth like thee;

And still the raging Sea.
Egypts power;
And Israel did adore,
When they beheld the drowned Host
Lie scattered on the shore.

Made by thy powerful voice;

Which in thy care rejoice.

Can no resistance fear;

In all thy Rule appear.

The joyful sound of praise;
They through thy favor shall enjoy
Pleasant and happy days.

Will fresh delights create;
And thou, the Glory of their strength,
Wilt raise their low Estate.
Psalm XC.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Thou have our help and refuge been.

Or ever thou had formed the Earth,
Thou had a Being long before,
And shall abide when time's no more.

Bidding him Turn again to Dust.

In life so long, is but a day
Compared with thee; and in thy sight,
Like the short Watches of the Night.

Sweeps us away; our Life's a Dream.

Cut down e're Night, and withered are.



As swiftly as a breath or thought.

If to another Stage we get,
And unto Fourscore years arrive,
We rather sigh and groan, then live.
Part. II.

The Power and Terror of thy wrath?
Wrath that is equal to our dread,
And strikes so often Sinners dead.

And Sorrows that this Life attend,
May more excite our fear of thee,
And a wise care of Piety.

When will thou give our troubles ease?
Now we are humble and repent,
Show pity to us and relent.

We long impatiently to taste:

Let Gladness crown our future years.

And please thee most; do thou appear
In those to us and to our Race:

Afford thy Light to guide our way,
That we may never go astray:
All our good undertakings bless,
And prosper with desired success.
Psalm XCI.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Has gained a safe and quiet seat.
For Gods o're-spreading Providence
Will like a shade be his Defense.

On him, my powerful God, rely.

He Will save thee from the secret snare.

His faithful promise be thy shield:

Shall seize thee with a sudden fright.

And all around with slaughter fill,
Walking unseen both Night and Day,
Shall miss their aim, or balk their way.

And thou the while unhurt shall stand:

What shall the wickeds portion be.
Part. II.

Thy Refuge and Security;

Nor Plague thy dwelling shall infest.

To thee shall kind attendance pay.

Lest thou should stumble to thy hurt.

Tread the Aspe and Dragon under feet.

From dangers I will set him free.
Becaufe he knows and fears my Name,
I Will honor him and raise his Fame.

I Will hear and answer him with speed.
When he is in Trouble I Will stand by,
To save, and set him up on High.

Will show him my Salvation.
Psalm XCII.

To praise the Lord above;

His faithfulness and Love;

With an Harmonious voice!

Have made me to rejoice.

Contain the deepest sense;

Thy ways of Providence.

With good success o'rejoy'd:
And only grow to be mown down,
And utterly destroyed.

Or stately Cedars grow:
For planted in thy Courts, they are fed
With Springs that ever flow.

And still more fruit shall bring:
Age that makes other things decay,
Makes them more flourishing.

To be both good and just;
No falseness can be charged on him
That is my Rock and trust.
Psalm XCIII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Puts on his Robes of Glorious Light;
Tremble thou Earth, when he appears
Clothed and girt about with might.
Under his Rule the unquiet World
Will gain stability and peace;

And, like himself, can never cease.

In Tumults and Commotions use;
Like troubled Waters of the Sea,
That bid Defiance to the Skies.

That Is far above your threatening noise;
For even the Seas unruly Waves
Do calmly listen to his voice.

So all thy promises are sure:
It Is thy Perfection to be true,
And theirs that serve thee, to be pure.
Psalm XCIII.
[Another Meter.]


With Robes of glorious Light:
Tremble thou Earth, when he appears
Girded about with might.
Now the unquiet World will gain
Stability and peace,

Himself can never cease.

Combined in Tumults rise;
Like Waters of the Sea, that bid
Defiance to the Skies.

That Is far above your noise;
For even the Seas unruly Waves
Are calmed at his voice.

Thy Promises are sure;
Thy Glory's to be true, and theirs
That serve thee, to be pure.
Psalm XCIV.

At length thy Justice show;

Rewards that are their due.

And boast their Villainies;

And providence despise?



Or else regards it not.

These senseless Fools be wise?

And see that formed the Eyes?

And teaches Man his skill:
Shall not he know then, and chastise
Thy disobedient will?

Impieties maintain:
God knows these very thoughts of thine,
How false they are and vain.
Part. II.

By chastisements have taught;
And thereby to a sense of thee,
And of his Duty brought.

From troubles set him free;
Whilst vengeance ruins wicked men's
Short-lived prosperity.

May under troubles groan;
God will not utterly forsake,
Nor cast away his own.

Again to act its part;
And then felicity shall crown
The men of upright heart.

To other aids in vain;

I and my hopes had lain.

Thy mercy me upheld:
Thy comforts eased my troubled thoughts,
And swelling passions quelled.
Psalm XCV.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

And to the Lord our voices raise;

With thankful hearts and Psalms of praise.

Of power super-eminent
Above all Gods; him Angels serve,
And Princes only represent.

And strength of Hills are in his hand:

And for their bound prepared the Land.

And humble Adorations give;

The Sheep that on his pastures live.

And not such hardened Sinners prove,

Provoked and tempted God above.
They proved his power, and saw his works,

Till, wearied with their murmurings,
That Race he could no longer bear.
He did their stupid unbelief,
And base Ingratitude detest;

They should not come into his Rest.
Psalm XCV.
[Another Meter.]


To God our voices raise:

And loudly sing his praise.

In power eminent
Above all Gods: him Angels serve,
And Princes represent.

Of Hills are in his hand;

And for their bound, dry land.

And Adorations give;

That on his pastures live.

Such hardened Sinners prove,

Provoked God above.
They proved his power, and saw his works,

Till, wearied with that murmuring Race,
He could no longer bear.
He did their unbelief, and base
Ingratitude detest;

Not come into his rest.
Psalm XCVI.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

To sing the choicest Psalm of praise;

And all his saving works proclaim.

His wonders to the Nations show;

More feared than any Deity:

He made the Heavens and every Star.

In Beauty and in strength excels.

Glory and Power to God ascribe:

Their Offerings in his Courts renew.

His Majesty and Holiness;
Let all the Earth the Lord revere,
And by their Duty show their fear.

A Judge that equity maintains;
He Will make their Wars and Tumults cease,
And bless the Earth with quiet peace.

The Ocean by its roaring noise;

Trees by the Fruits that Crown their Tops.

And only Sinners are afraid:
All whom he judges shall confess
His Equity and Righteousness.
Psalm XCVII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]


And cloud his ways of Providence,
Yet perfect justice is their ground.


A dreadful Fire before him goes,
To burn up all his Enemies.
The amazed Earth sees this and quakes,


And Men below his Glories own.

That to a graven Image bow,
And boast of Idols; worship him,
Angels above and Gods below.

When Judgments on these Sinners fall;

And thou art high above them all.

Strictly preserve your innocence;
Then let the wicked seek your fall,
God will stand up for your defense.

For truly pious men are sown:
A joyful Harvest will at length
Their labors and their sorrows Crown.

The God you serve is good and kind:
Praise him for all his Mercies past,
And wait with joy for those behind.
Psalm XCVII.
[ Another Meter.]


And Cloud his ways of providence,
Yet Justice is their ground.

Do flame around the Skies;

Up all his Enemies.
The Earth sees this and quakes, the Hills


And Men his Glories own.

That to an Image bow,
And boast of Idols; worship him,
Angels and Gods below.

Shall on these Sinners fall;

Art high above them all.

Preserve your innocence;
Then let the wicked seek your fall,
God will be your defense.
The immortal Seeds of light and bliss
For pious men are sown;
A joyful Harvest will at length
Their work and sorrows crown.
Then let your cheerful temper show
The God you serve is kind;
Praise him for Mercies past, and wait
With joy for those behind.
Psalm XCVIII.

What wonders he has done;
Let all proclaim the Victories
His powerful Arm has won.

A secret, and enclosed;
Now to the clear and open view
Of Heathens is exposed.

Was first to Israel shown;
But now the ends of the Earth have seen
His great Salvation.



To testify their joys.

The joys of Neighboring lands;

And Rivers clap their hands.

When Gods approach is nigh:
Who comes to judge and rule the World
With Truth and Equity.
Psalm C.

To God their cheerful voices raise;

Before his Face with Songs of praise.

Who did to all their Beings give;
We are the people of his Care,
The Sheep that on his pastures live.

His praises in his Courts proclaim;
And let his powerful love excite
Each Soul to bless his Sacred Name.

His mercy is for ever sure;
His Truth from Generation
To Generation shall endure.
Psalm CII.

Of mine afflicted State;

Before it be too late.

Make have and fly away;
As Flowers before the scorthing Sun,
They wither and decay.

My better days be past;
Thine undeclining years beyond
All Generations last.

Of old by thee were laid;
The Fair and Beauteous Heavens show
The work thy hands have made.

Like Garments throws aside;
But when they change, thy years never fail,


Thy Word to them is sure;
Though strange Events may change the World,
Their Race shall still endure.
Psalm CIII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Let all the powers within me bless;

Forgotten in unthankfulness.

He that in sickness makes thee found:

Thy Life, with Love and Mercy Crowned.

And all thy just desires supplies:
Who, like the Eagles, makes thine Age
To a renewed youth arise.

Oppressed Innocence shall find:
Moses and Israel knew his ways,
And the inclinations of his mind.

Love is his Nature and Delight;

Intends not to destroy us quite.
His Anger in its rise and stay,
From Rules of Justice never swerves;

The measure's less than sin deserves.

So his Rewards exceed our Love;

His pardon does our sins remove.
Part. II.

Resembles God's, though shorter far;

That only quickened Dust we are.

That in the Field its beauty shows;

And then its former place none knows.

Is to good men and to their race:

His favor ever will embrace.

Whose Throne is placed in Heaven above;
Whose mighty Power and Sovereign Rule,
Extends over all that Live and Move.

And ready services transcend;

Who all, to do his will, attend.

In every place to his control;
Bless ye your Maker; and with them
Join in his praises, O my Soul.
Psalm CIII.
[ Another Meter.]

All Powers within me bless;

Lost in unthankfulness.

Thy sicknesses remove;

And Crowns thy Life with Love.

Thy just desires supplies;
Who, like the Eagles, makes thine Age
To a new youth arise.

Wronged Innocence shall find:
Moses, his ways; and Israel knew
The Intentions of his mind.

His Nature and Delight;

Would not destroy us quite.
His anger in its rise and stay
From Justice never swerves:

It Is less than sin deserves.

So his Rewards our Love:

He does our sins remove.
Part. II.

Than God's is lesser far;

And knows that Dust we are.

Fresh when it is newly blown,

Whose place no more is known.

To good men and their Race:

His favor will embrace.

Whose Throne's in Heaven above:
Whose Sovereign Empire does extend
Over all that live and move.

And services transcend;

Who all his will attend.

Subject to his control,
Bless ye your Maker; and with them
Join in his praise, my Soul.
Psalm CIV.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

To this his Greatness does invite;
Honor and Majesty's his Robe

He as a Tent the Heavens extends,

Clouds are his Chariot, and the Winds
With their Winged Wheels mete out his way.

As flames, with quick obedience move;
To publish and effect below,
His pleasure, given in charge above.

No Pillars raised its weight to bear;
And yet no power can make it move,
Though it hangs loose in fluid air.

Whose Waves the Highest Hills surpassed;

They shrank and fled away in have.

Thence to the lower Vales descend;
Till in the Sea, whence first they came,
At last their winding courses end.

Threatens again the Earth to cover;
It Is fixed bounds no rising Tides,
Without new leave, can e're pass over.
Part. II.

Causes the Crystal Springs to burst;

And the wild Asses quench their thirst.

Their Nests in shady Boughs to raise;
And by their cheerful Notes reprove
Our Silence in our Makers praise.

For thirst, complain that they are forgot:
Clouds big with showers on them distill,
And water every barren plot.

Food for all Creatures does produce;
The Grass springs up to serve the Beasts,
And Herbs for Man's peculiar use.

That makes his Countenance look bright;
Bread the support of Life; all made
To serve our needs, or our delight.

Need not be watered by our care;
Where Lebanon does highest rise,
Cedars are ever fresh and fair.

Storks for their dwelling choose the Pine;

Conies in Rocks they undermine.
Part. III.

Measures the Seasons of the Year;
And having run his daily course,
The Sun knows when to set, and where.

It Is Night that brings wild Beasts abroad;

By hunger taught, leek meat from God.

Crowd to their Dens with hasty flight;

And ends together with the Light.

Created all with wondrous skill.
Thy Blessings, Lord, enrich the Earth,

Whose yielding Waves the Ships divide;
There Fishes move of different size;
Leviathan
Does play, and Man's attempts despise.

Thine Alms of seasonable food:

They gather, and are filled with good.
Part. IV.

The whole Creation needs must mourn;
If he withholds his breath, or theirs,
They die, and to their dust return.

All things with Life and Joy endues;
His powerful word, that made the Earth
At first, its Face again renews.

Gods Glory never can beless;
And what his wisdom made so good,
His favor will delight to bless.

Gods dreadful Anger to provoke;
Whose Look can cause the Earth to quake,
His Touch make proudest Hills to smoke.

Shall be to praise this mighty Lord;

The sweetest pleasure will afford.

No place or thought regard them more:
Bless thou thy Maker, O my Soul,
Let Heaven and Earth his Name adore.
Psalm CIV.
[ Another Meter.]

His greatness does invite,
Honor and Majesty's his Robe,


Whose Rooms on Waters stay;
Clouds are his Chariot, and the Winds
Winged Wheels mete out his way.

As flames, attend and move,
His pleasure to effect below,
That Is given in charge above.

Its weight no Pillars bear;
Yet none can move it, though it hangs
Loose in the yielding air.

Whose Waves the Hills surpassed:

They shrank and fled in haste.

Thence to the Vales descend;
Till in the Sea, whence first they came,
Their winding courses end.

Threatens the Earth to cover;
Its fixed bounds no swelling Tides
Can, without leave, pass over.
Part. II.

Makes Crystal Springs to burst;

Drink to allay their thirst.

In shady boughs to raise;
Whose cheerful notes our silence shame
In our Creators praise.

For thirst, say they are forgot;
Clouds big with showers on them distill,
And water every plot.

Does food for all produce;
The Grass springs up to serve the Beasts,
And Herbs for humane use.

That makes his Face look bright;
Bread the support of Life; all serve
Our Needs, or our Delight.

Unwatered by our care;
Cedars in the heights of Lebanon,
Are ever fresh and fair.

Dwells in the lofty Pine;

In Rocks they undermine.
Part. III.

The Seasons of the Year;
After his daily course, the Sun
Knows when to set, and where.

Night brings wild Beasts abroad;

And seek their meat from God.

They crowd with hasty flight;

And finished with the light.

All made with wondrous skill!
Thy blessings, Lord, enrich the Earth,

There go the Ships, and there do move
Fishes of different size;
Leviathan does play,
And Man's attempts despise.

Of seasonable food;

And all are filled with good.
Part. IV.

All Creatures needs must mourn;
If he withholds their breath, they die,
And to their Dust return.

All things with life endues;
His powerful word that made the Earth,
Its face again renews.

Gods Fame will never be less;
And what his Wisdom made so good,
Will still delight to bless.

Gods anger to provoke;
Whose look can cause the Earth to quake,
His Touch make Hills to smoke.

To praise this Mighty Lord;

The sweetest Joys afford.

No place regards them more;
Bless thou the Lord, my Soul, his name
Let Heaven and Earth adore.
Psalm CV.

And call upon his Name;
His gracious and his mighty works,
To all the World proclaim.

Our great Creator bless;
And what his powerful hand has wrought,
Our joyful tongues express.

The praise that is his due:
And your unfeigned inward joys,
By cheerful voices show.

Your Prayers to him be made;
Your hopes upon his favor rest,
And his Almighty aid.

Your admiration move;
Think on the judgments of his mouth,
And wonders of his Love.

Us for his people owns;
Whose judgments make the amazed Earth
To tremble when he frowns.

He ever called to mind;
And will his promises fulfill
To Ages still behind.
Psalm CVI.

For he alone is good;
His mercies they continue sure,
As they have ever stood.

None can their voices raise;
Nor, as Gods mighty Acts deserve,
Can show forth all his praise.

Observe with due regard;
And by well-doing to receive
Gods mercies are prepared.

With favor, Lord, look down:
And bless me with the saving grace
Afforded to thine own.

Of thine Elect may share;
And may hereafter sing thy praise,
In joys that endless are.
Psalm CVII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

So full of kindness and of Love;
Whose Mercy Ages past have known,
And those that are to come shall crown.

Whom he redeemed when sore oppressed:

From all the Lands to their own home.

They found, nor City where to stay:

Nor Water-Springs their thirst to assuage.

Who proved their Savior and their guide:

And place where they should dwell, did snow.

His wonders to the Sons of Men;

Their craving hunger satisfies.
Part. II.

So nigh to Death, they are in its shade;
On whom the sorrows that they bear,
Sit heavier than the Chains they wear:

Contemned his Counsels for their good;

To quell the stoutness of their heart.
Before his strokes they could not stand,
Nor none could raise them, but his hand.

To importune his Clemency;
Who did regard their low address,
And saved them out of their distress;

And brake their bands in sunder quite.

His wonders to the Sons of Men.

Brake Bars of Ir'n, and Gates of brass.
Part. III.

Prepare for their own punishment.
Sickness and loathsome maladies,
From Luxury and Lust arise.

His tastful meats will not go down.
Nature with heavy loads oppressed,
Beckons to Death to be released.

To God for help; whose earnest cry
Moved a regard to their address,
Heaven saved them out of this distress.

Their virtue's not so quick nor sure;
Deaths sentence only he repealed,
He sent his word, and they were healed.

His wonders to the Sons of men;

Declare his Works and their own joys.
Part. IV.



And lift its Waves unto the Skies.

They sink into the Depths as often.

Like Drunkards to and fro they reel.

For help in their extremity;
He lends an Ear to their address,
And brings them out of this distress.

The furious Waves depose their rage.

The Haven where they wished to be.

His wonders to the Sons of men;

But in the Church his Glories sing.
Part. V.

Turns Rivers to a desert land;

When wickedness therein abounds.

To fruitful Pastures do improve.

Which after to a City grow.

Whose Fruits supply their growing want.

Their wealth increases with their flocks,

They Are punished and brought low again.

And wander in a state forlorn.

And spreads their numerous Family.

And wickedness shall silent be.

These wondrous dealings of the Lord?
All wise observers still shall find,
That God is infinitely kind.
Psalm CX.
[As the 100. Psalm.]

Sit thou advanced on my right hand,
Till all thy conquered Foes shall crouch,
And wait their doom from thy command.
Sion shall thy word go forth,
Which like a Scepter thou shall sway;
To bring the stubborn under rule,
And make them willingly obey.

The numerous Converts thou shall view,
Shall make an Army that exceeds
The Crystal drops of Morning dew.

By Oath, which he can never break,
To make thee an eternal Priest,
Of the Order of Melchizedeck,

Proud Monarchs that oppose his Reign

That will not stoop to him, be slain

To mean refreshments in the way;
But with a glorious reward,
God will his sufferings repay.
Psalm CXI.

And with affection join
In those Assemblies, where the Saints
To praise the Lord combine.

Will soon with pleasure see

How great thy purity.

They Will often call to mind;
With grateful hearts proclaim, that God
Is gracious and kind.

Food with a liberal hand;

The Heathens pleasant land.

His word is no less sure;

Performance is secure.
Israel, from slavery redeemed,
His Holiness did know;
Their Foes the Terror of thy Name
Felt in their overthrow.

And he that strives to please
His Maker, understands him best,
Whose praise shall never cease.
Psalm CXII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Whose pleasure it is to do his will;

His happy race shall flourish still.

And as his wealth and stores increase,
His Bounty is enlarged; no fear
Of future want does make it less.

They Will in his greater comfort end;
What kindness God on him bestows,
The same to others he will extend.

Discreetly orders all his way;

Or make his Memory decay.

His confidence in God displace;

His Foes securely in the face.

With suitable rewards will crown;
Not only those above bestow,
But honor here and great renown.

With indignation at his Bliss;
And melt away with grief, to see
This Man obtain, what they shall miss.
Psalm CXII.
[Another Meter.]


And joys to do His will;

His race shall flourish still.

And as his stores increase,
His bounty is enlarged; no fear
Of want does make it less.

They Will in his comfort end;
What kindness God on him bestows,
To others he will extend.

Discreetly guides his way;

His Memory decay.

Of Danger can displace:

His En'emies in the Face.

With great Rewards will Crown;
Both those above bestow, and here
Honor and great Renown.

With envy at his Bliss;
Consume with grief, to see this Man
Obtain, what they shall miss.
Psalm CXIII.

To God your cheerful praises sing,


Where e're the Sun does rise or set;
Since all are blessed, let all adore.

And Heaven's too narrow to contain
His Glories that are infinite.

With his Perfections to compare,
Who dwells in uncreated Light.

The affairs of Mortals here below,
As well as those in Heaven above.

He from the Dust the poor does raise,
And from his vile estate remove:

To unexpected Dignity,
And sets him in a Royal Throne.

He makes the Barren Womb to bear:
O therefore praise this God alone.
Psalm CXV.
[ At the 100. Psalm.]

But to thy name the praise we owe;
To thy free goodness and thy Truth,
The Springs whence all our Blessings flow.

Where is the God whom you adore?

What e're his will ordained before.

And all their worth derive from thence;
With no Divinity inspired,
Since they are void of Life or sense.



Nor lively motion by his Art.

A God, to which our Knees should bow;
You trust what cannot help it self;
Statues have sense as much as you.
Part. II.

In him repose your Confidence;



And those that fear him still will bless;



By him that made both Earth and Heaven;

In kindness he to Man has given.

Thy wonders, nor proclaim thy praise;

Which shall continue all our days.
Psalm CXV.
[Another Meter.]


We give the praise we owe;
To thy free goodness and thy truth,
Whence all our Blessings flow.

The God, whom you adore?

What he ordained before.

Their worth derive from thence;
With no Divinity inspired,
Since void of Life or sense.



Motion, or Life, by Art.

To which our Knees should bow:
You trust what cannot help it self;
Statues have sense like you.
Part. II.

Repose your confidence:

This helper and defense.

That fear him still will bless;



That made both Earth and Heaven;

In kindness he has given.

Nor celebrate thy praise;

And bless thee all our days.
Psalm CXVI.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

To all my poor requests did give;

And best Devotions, whilst I live.

The sad Forerunners of the Grave;

My life from threatening danger save.

Nor did his Mercy come too late;

His kindness raised my low estate.

In quiet rest, freed from thy fears;

And dried up all thy falling tears.



All men will lie, and I Am deceived.

For all the kindness he has shown?

And thankfully his favors own.

I made to God, shall be my care;

And showed my Life to him was dear.

Thy Servant whom thou have set free;
The very Bonds that thou have loosed
Shall tie me faster unto thee.
Psalm CXVI.
[Another Meter.]


To my requests did give;

Devotions whilst I live.

Forerunners of the Grave,

From threatening danger save.

His Mercy come too late:

He raised my low estate.

Quiet and free from fears;

And dried up all thy tears.



Will lie, and I Am deceived.

The kindness thou have shown?

Will all thy favors own.

To God, shall be my care:

My Life to him was dear.

Thy Servant, Lord, I Will be;
The bonds that thou have loosed, shall tie
Me faster unto thee.
Psalm CXVII.

Their great Creator praise;
And all its scattered people join
His mighty Name to raise.

His Mercies ever sure;
Then let our praises like his Truth,
For ever still endure.
Psalm CXVIII.

Have known to be so kind;
Whose mercies will continue sure
To Ages still behind.



His mercies have no end.

Gods goodness to express;
Who heard my Prayer, and set me free
When I was in distress.

When God is my defense:

I Will put my confidence.

The dwellings of the Just;

That in his Goodness trust.

Even to my latest Breath,

Has saved me still from death.
Part. II.

And though thou wast before
My gracious God, art now become
My powerful Savior.

Unfit, aside was thrown;
Is chosen and preferred to be
The Head and Corner Stone.

By us with wonder seen;

And we will rejoice therein.

And loud Hosanna's sing;
Wishing prosperity may wait
On him that is our King.

On this kind errand came,
We welcome thee; and bless all those
That spread thy Glorious Fame.

On us with Light and Grace;
And at thine Altar we will present
Our Sacrifice of praise.

Shall ever sing thy praise;
Thou art my God, and I on high
Thy glorious name will raise.

That God is good and kind;
Whose mercies, which have ever been,
Good men shall ever find.
Psalm CXIX.

The Law of God directs;

To serve the Lord affects.

Who to these paths repair;

All thy Commands with care.

Never from thine to swerve;

Whilst I thy Laws observe.

Instructed in thy fear:

Me grace to persevere.

Govern their Manners, Lord?
By heedful listening to the wise
Directions of thy word.

O keep me close to thee.

Might not a Sinner be.
Part. II.

I have declared around;

That has a Treasure found.

The wonders of thy Law.

Must Light and Comfort draw.

Thy Law my Rule have made:

Since thou have made me glad.

And knowledge of thy will;
Then, what thy sacred Law enjoins,
I Will heartily fulfill.

Whilst others riches prize;

Lord turn away mine Eyes.
To practice goodness, let my Love
And quick desires appear;

Devoted to thy fear.
Part. III.

I count to me most dear;

Before this World prefer.

And then without delay
Resolved to change my course, and turn
Into thy safer way.

Too soon I turned aside;
But by thy chastisements reduced,
Thy Precepts were my guide.

And do all good afford;
By my afflictions make me more
Obedient to thy word.

With Wisdom me endue;
And by the knowledge of thy Laws,
Lord, form my Soul anew.

And all my troubles just;

For in thy word I trust.
Part. IV.

Thy word is settled fast;

Does to all Ages last.

Continue to this Day:
And all like ready Servants stand
Thine Orders to obey.

Thy Law been my delight,
Under the pressure of my woes,
IN had sunk and perished quite.

I soon discern an end;
But thy large Precepts, to all times
And states of life extend.

My daily exercise;

Than all mine Enemies;

Like what thy words create;

Of every sin to hate.
Part. V.

Unto my Paths a light;

Which I Will perform aright.

The World, depart from me;
From faithful serving of my God
You shall no hindrance be.

Fills me with fear and awe.

Proud men despise thy Law.

And mercy be the same,
Thou usest to express to those
That love and fear thy name.

And my Director be;
Then no iniquity shall gain
Dominion over me.

By bold impieties;
This makes me sadly to lament,
And tears overflow mine Eyes.
Part. VI.

Exactly do agree;

And such thy Precepts be.

My indignation rise;
To see my Foes forget thy words,
And thy just Laws despise.

Refined, is my delight:

The watches of the Night.

Who thy Commandments love:
And no Temptations unto sin,
To them a scandal prove.

And Testimonies prise;

To thine All-seeing Eyes.

But now to thee I come;
Thy Precepts I resolve to obey,
Lord bring thy Servant home.
Psalm CXXI.

And thence will look for aid:

Which Earth and Heaven made.

With his Almighty Arm;

From all surprising harm.

Will be thy sure Defense;

Malignant influence.

Preserve thy Soul from sin:

And bless thy coming in.
Psalm CXXIII.

Art placed above the Skies!
To thee for succor I direct
Mine heart, and lift mine Eyes.

With more submission stands:
Nor Maids with greater Duty wait
Their Mistresses Commands:
Than we that justly undergo
The Discipline of God
Wait for a merciful release,
When he will remove his Rod.

In thy Compassion lies;
And, whom insulting Foes do scorn,
Lord, do not thou despise.

Advantage to their Pride:
And they that live in wealth and ease,
Our miseries deride.
Psalm CXXIV.

His people now may say;

To succor us that day,
When wicked men, with cruel wrath
Inflamed, against us rose;

Their fury to oppose.

Had been an easy prey;

Had swept us quite away.

His mercy to enhance;
Then when our dangers loudest called
To send Deliverance.

Caught in the Fowlers Net:
Gods power broke the snare, and we
At Liberty were set.

That Earth and Heaven made:
Our future hopes shall all depend
On his Almighty aid.
Psalm CXXV.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Repose, and him their Fortress make,
Remain unmoved, like Sions Mount,
Which Storms and Tempests never shake.
Jerusalem with Hills begirt,
Derives great safety from that fence;
Good Men much more from Angels guard,
And Gods surrounding Providence.

Oppress the good, and vex their peace;
Lest the Temptation prove so strong,
They imitate their wickedness.


Rebellious Sinners to destroy,
Then, Lord, with peace the Righteous crown.
Psalm CXXV.
[ Another Meter.]

And him their Fortress make,
Remain unmoved, like Sions Mount
Which Tempests never shake.
Jerusalem with Hills begirt,
Is safe by this defense;
Good Men are more secure from Gods
Surrounding Providence.

Oppress and vex their peace;
Lest, through discouragement, they prove
Like them in wickedness.

Thy vengeance shall come down
Proud Sinners to destroy; then, Lord,
With Peace the Righteous crown.
Psalm CXXVI.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

It seemed a strange and pleasant dream;

To tell this News was all our Theme.
This great and unexpected change
Forced the Heathens to confess

The same with greater joy express.
Great are thy Mercies shown to us;

'Twill be like welcome showers to ground
That Is partched with the scortching Sun.

All needful Blessings do restore;
And hope our former tears will make
Our after joys to be the more.

His scattered handfuls sadly leaves,
Will shout at Harvest, when he sees
That Seed become a Load of Sheaves.
Psalm CXXVI.
[ Another Meter.]

It seemed a pleasant dream:

And joy was all our Theme.
This mercy so unlooked for, moved
The Heathens to confess

With joy the same express.
Great are thy Mercies shown to us:

'Twill be like welcome showers to ground
Partch'd with the scortching Sun.

All good to us restore;
And hope our former tears will make
Our after joys the more.

His scattered handfulls leaves;
Will shout at Harvest, when that Seed
Becomes a Load of Sheaves.
Psalm CXXVII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Men strive in vain a House to erect:
Unless the Lord the City keep,
The watchful Guards as well may sleep.

Begin, and last when Day is done:
TO avoid that Poverty you dread,
With carefulness you eat your Bread.
But all in vain: by Heaven blessed
You may enjoy both wealth and rest;

As Gods rewards to Goodness come:

Like Arrows to a Man of War:

A Man may dare his Enemies.
Psalm CXXVIII.

Is by obedience shown:

And good success shall crown.

With Clusters shall abound;
Whose Children like green Olive Plants,
Thy Table shall surround.

When God's thy chiefest fear

Shall have the greatest share.

Thy lengthned Age shall see;
And, the great wish of all good Men,
The Lands prosperity.
Psalm CXXX.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

To God I cried with fervent Prayer;

Not sunk so low but thou can hear.

In strict severity proceed,
Who would be able to abide
Thy censure, and be justified?

That men may turn and fear thy name.

And on thy promises rely.

Than Guards that watch the approach of day.

In God alone repose their trust.
The frailty of our state he knows;
His plenteous Mercy ever flows.

And pardons what they have done amiss.
Psalm CXXXI.

Nor Eyes that lofty are;
Nor meddle with the things advanced,
Above my lower Sphere.

Composed to silent rest;
Mine as a Child's behavior is,
Weaned from his Mothers Breast.

The Worlds deceitful shows;
But with an undisturbed mind
In God their trust repose.
Psalm CXXXIII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Resembling that of Heaven above!
Where Brethren peacefully unite
In sweet accord and hearty Love.

On Aarons consecrated head;
Which first ran down his face, and thence
Unto his costly vesture spread.

Or as the fruitful showers of rain;
Though first on higher grounds they fall,
Descend, and water all the plain.
Innumerable comforts meet,
Where Love and Amity abound;
Their Souls are filled with inward peace,
Their prosperous State with blessing crowned.
Psalm CXXXIII.
[ Another Meter.]

Resembling Heaven above;
Where Brethren peacefully unite,
In sweet Accord and Love.

Upon the High Priests Head;
Which first ran down his Face, and thence
Unto his Garments spread.

Or fruitful showrs of rain,
Though first on higher grounds they fall,
Thence water all the plain.
Innumerable comforts meet,
Where mutual Love is found;
Their Souls are filled with inward peace,
Their State with blessing crowned.
Psalm CXXXIV.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Who early at his Temple wait,
And there your late attendance give,
See that his Name ye celebrate.

Pure hands in your Devotions raise;
To all your other offerings join
The grateful Sacrifice of praise.

As great in Goodness as in power,
Give gracious Answers to thy Prayers,
And bless his people every hour.
Psalm CXXXIV.
[ Another Meter.]

Who at his Temple wait;
See that before the rising Sun
His name ye celebrate.

In your Devotions raise;
To all your other offerings join
The Sacrifice of praise.

In goodness as in power,
Give Ear to thy requests, and bless
His people every hour.
Psalm CXXXV.

That Heaven and Earth did frame;

Praise ye his Glorious Name.

Your best affections raise;
Your inward Pleasure will increase,
Together with your praise.

His Greatness knows no bound;
What'ere by other Gods is claimed,
In him alone is found.

His Pleasure rules them still;
His uncontrouled mind the Heaven,
The Earth and Seas fulfill.

The vapors to arise,
Which frame the Clouds, where fire unquench'd,
Mingled with water lies.
From thence the dreadful Lightnings burst,
And Rains are poured down;
He brings his boisterous Winds and Storms,
From Treasuries unknown.

Thy Fame can never die;
But thy Memorial shall endure
To all Eternity.
Psalm CXXXV.
[ Another Meter. As the 148. Psalm.]

That Heaven and Earth did frame;

Praise ye his glorious name.

To this invite;
His praise will give
The best delight.

His Greatness knows no bound;
What other Gods do claim,
In him is only found.

He all things made,
Still rules over all,
By all obeyed.

Are subject to his will;
The Earth and Seas below
His pleasure do fulfill.
At his Command,
From the Worlds end,
Vapors to frame
The Clouds ascend.
Lightnings from thence burst out,
And Rains are poured down;
He brings his boyst'rous Winds
From Treasuries unknown.

Memorial,
For ever, Lord,
Continue shall.
Psalm CXXXVI.
[ As the 148. Psalm.]

That is so kind and good;
Whose mercies firmly last,
As they have ever stood.

All Gods do bow,

And Powers below.



Above the Waters laid.



To rule the Night.
Egypts firstborn he smote,

Isreal's Yoke,
And brought them from that Land.
His Mercies shown
To Ages past,
Eternally
Shall spring and last.

Israel to pass;

Of Pharaoh drowned was.

The Desert led,
By Miracles
Were daily fed.

Sihon and Og he smote;


His Mercies shown
To Ages past
Eternally
Shall spring and last.




Whose Mercies shown
To Ages past,
Eternally
Shall spring and last.
Psalm CXXXVIII.

Thy best affections raife;
Angels shall hear my Songs, and be
The Partners of my praise.

And goodness I Will proclaim;
These raise my wonder, and advance
The Glories of thy Name.

And thou my Prayer did hear;
Thou did support me with thy strength,
And with thy comforts cheer.

And take occasion thence

Thy ways of Providence.

The lowly views and owns;
But scorns the proud, and on their height
With indignation frowns.

My fears, when in distress;
Thy hand shall save me from my Foes,
Thy Power their wrath repress.

Complete what is begun;
O never suffer thine own work,
Nor me to be undone.
Psalm CXXXIX.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

In vain I seek to be concealed:

My very thoughts are all revealed.

My walking and my lying down;

Better than to my self, are known.

Of thine encircling Arm I lie;

Nor escape the notice of thine Eye.

A place where God does never come?

His Power, had I in Hell a room.

Winged with the swiftest Morning ray;

My flight, would my abode betray.

The blackest Curtains of the Night;

We Darkness call, to thee is Light.

With all the affections seated there;
To thee, that made'st those hidden Springs
Within the Womb, must needs appear.
Part. II.

The Footsteps of thy wondrous skill;
And to excite my praise, I find
Within my self more wonders still.

The dark recesses of the Womb;
Before the fine Embroidery
Of parts was to perfection come;

The daily growth of every part;
And what the Eternal mind had framed,
Was copied out with curious art.

And the wise Counsels of thy mind;
Their sum is infinite; yet all
Are dear to me, because they are kind.

Which whilst my busy thoughts run over,
I sleep; and sind when I awake,
I Am only where I was before.

Of living in a false disguise;
I Am less afraid to undergo
The Trial of thy piercing Eyes.

Unwillingly have done amiss,
Correct my errors, and reduce
My wanderings to the way of Bliss.
Psalm CXXXIX.
[Another Meter.]


I seek to be concealed.

To thee are all revealed.

Walking and lying down;

Than to my selfs are known.

Encircling Arm I lie;

Nor escape thy piercing Eye.

I seek to find a Seat;

Thy Glories I should meet.

Winged with the Mornings Ray;

Would my abode betray.

The Curtains of the Night;

Darkness, to thee is Light.

The affections seated there,
To thee, that made within the Womb
Those hidden Springs, appear.
Part. II.

Footsteps of wondrous skill;
And in my selfs, to excite my praise,
I find more wonders still.

Recesses of the Womb;
Before the Embroidery of Parts
Was to perfection come;

The growth of every part;
And what the Eternal mind had framed,
Was drawn with curious Art.

And Counsels of thy mind;
Their sum is infinite, yet dear
To me, because they are kind.

Which whilst my thoughts run over,
I sleep; and find, when I awake,
I Am where I was before.

TO have lived in false disguise;
I Am less afraid to undergo
The Trial of thine Eyes.

Thou see I Have done amiss;
Correct, and lead my wandering steps
Into the way of Bliss.
Psalm CXLIII.

The hopes I have in thee;
And, Lord, according to thy Truth
And Goodness answer me.

Thy strict Tribunal tried;
For, Lord, if thou should be severe,
None could be justified.

Shall thy refreshments gain;
Thy mercy which I gasp for more,
Than thirsty ground for rain.

The assistance I would have;
If God still frown on my requests,
'Twill sink me to the Grave.

As well as trust in thee;
O let the joyful Morning tell
Thy kindness toward me.
Lord be my Guide, that I may find
The way where I should go:

That seek my overthrow.

And let thy spirit of Love,
Conduct me in the paths that lead
To happiness above.

And honor to advance;
Thy faithfulness will brightly shine
In my deliverance.
Psalm CXLV.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

Thou King of Saints and God of Love;

My work eternally above.

Whose greatness all our thoughts exceeds;

The next shall tell thy mighty deeds.

And thy amazing works proclaim:

Shall gladly join to do the same.

Of mercy; so their joys shall flow;
Their tongues thy faithfulness shall sing,
And thine abundant goodness show.

To anger slow, bur glad to spare;

Over all thy tender mercies are.

Some thankful Tribute do receive;
But where their powers fail, thy praise
Among the Saints shall ever live.

Thy Kingdoms glory never cease;

May know, and all thy Power confess.
Part. II.

Though often undermined in vain;

By thee; when falling, raised again.

Supplies of seasonable food;

Their longings with desired good.

In all his Ways and Works appear;

That call on him, and are sincere.

That they in vain have sought his aid;
He hears their cries, when in distress,
And saves them when they are afraid.

The Good Man's Duty and his Love;
But the bold crimes of wicked men,
Shall at the length their ruin prove.

Thy cheerful praises to proclaim;
Let all the World adore thy power,
And ever bless thy Holy name.
Psalm CXLV.
[Another Meter.]


My King, and God of Love;


Whose Greatness all exceeds;

And praise thy mighty deeds.

Thy wondrous works proclaim;

Shall join to do the same.

So shall their comforts flow;
Their tongues thy faithfulness shall sing,
And thy great goodness show.

Of Love, and glad to spare;

Thy tender Mercies are.

Thy works thou do receive;
But where they fail, thy praise among
The Saints shall ever live.

These Subjects never cease;

And all thy power confess.
Part. II.

Though undermined in vain;

When falling, raised again.

Supplies of daily food;

All their desires with good.

In all his ways appear;

As pray, and are sincere.

They Have sought in vain his aid;
He hears their cries when in distress,
And saves them, when afraid.

Rewards the good man's Love;
But the bold crimes of wicked men
At length their ruin prove.

Thy praises to proclaim;
Let all the World adore thy Power,
And ever bless thy Name.
Psalm CXLVI.

Thy best affections raise;

The subject of my praise.

Whose Glories at their Death

Do vanish with their Breath.

That made the World does trust;

Cease to be good and just.

The good Man's cause oppressed;
He feeds the hungry, and by him
The Prisoners are released.

Dejected Souls removes;
And by his special care protects
The Righteous whom he loves.

He does the Orphans own;
As for the wickeds prosperous state
He turns it upside down.

As he does ever Live;
Let all the World he rules, to him
Eternal praises give.
Psalm CXLVII.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]

To praise the God whom we adore!
How grateful to our selves and him!
Nothing becomes a good man more.

Of Captive Israel did repair;

He binds and heals with tender care.

What virtue comes to us from thence;
For it is from him they borrow all
Their Luster, and their Influence.

His power so great it knows no bound;

The stubborn Sinners to the ground.
Part. II.

Whose bounty all things does maintain;

And for the Earth prepares the rain.
He makes the tender Grass to grow
On Mountains which are parched and dry;

And the young Ravens when they cry.



And the Hoar-frosts like ashes strows.
None can endure his piercing cold;

Then Rocks of Ice are soon dissolved,
And the congealed Waters flow.
Israel
He greater favors did afford;
The clearer knowledge of his will
And Laws they had. Praise ye the Lord.
Psalm CXLVII.
[Another Meter.]


The Lord whom we adore!
How grateful to our selves and him!
Nothing becomes us more.

Of Isra'el did repair;

He heals with tender care.

What virtue comes from thence;
For it is from him they borrow all
Their Light and Influence.

His Power admits no bound:

Proud Sinners to the ground.
Part. II.

That all things does maintain:

The Earth prepares the rain.
He makes the tender Grass to grow
On Mountains parched and dry;

Young Ravens when they cry.



Hoar-frosts like ashes strows.
None can abide his piercing cold:

Then Rocks of Ice dissolve, and soon
Congealed Rivers flow.
Israel
More grace he did afford;
The clearer knowledge of his will
And Laws. Praise ye the Lord.
Psalm CXLVIII.

Let all their voices raise:

The great Creator's praise.

And every Star
His Glory show
That Is brighter far.

And watery Clouds that move
Within the liquid Sky,

Whose powerful word
Made you to be;

By his Decree.

Whales in the Depths concealed;

Vapors to Ice congealed,
The stormy Winds
Raised at his will,
Which at his word
Are calmed and still.

And Hills that lower are;
Cedars with lofty heads,
And Trees that fruit do bear.

Or Pastures lie;
Both creeping things
And Fowls that fly.

People of meaner Birth;
Princes that rule the World,
And Judges of the Earth.

And every Age

Of God engage.
His Glories all that shines
In Earth and Heaven excel;

TO his people Israel;
A people dear
And highly raised;
His Holy Name
Be ever praised.
Psalm CL.

Where he his Grace bestows;
Your wondering thoughts to Heaven raise,
Where he his Glory shows.

Your inward Passions move;
That your Acknowledgments may suit
The Greatness of his Love.



The triumphs of your joy.

That Breath by which they live;
Let every thing that breaths, to him
Their cheerful praises give.
Select Hymns, Taken out of the NEW TESTAMENT, And used in the CHURCH SERVICE.
Hymn I. Benedictus.
[ The Song of Zacharias. Luc. 1.68.]
LET Isr'els powerful God and King
Eternally be blessed;
Who came from Heaven to visit us,
And all our Bonds released.
In David's House a Savior raised,
To sit upon his Throne;
This, ever since the World began,
His Prophets have fore-shown.
That he would save us from the Power
And Malice of our Foes;
And would perform the Mercy he
TO our Fathers did disclose.
To call to mind how he engaged
His Truth by Covenant;
His solemn Oath to Abraham sworn;
That he his Grace would grant,
To serve him without fear, from all
Our Adversaries freed;
And to continue all our days
A Holy Life to lead.
And thou blessed, Child to this high Lord
Shall have a Prophets place;
Like a preparing Harbinger
Shall go before his Face.
By the Remission of Men's sins
To make Salvation known.
Gods tender mercy, when this Sun
Arose, to all was shown.
He will our sad and dismal state
With Light and Comfort bless;
And guide our feet into the way
Of Peace and Happiness.
Hymn II. Magnificat.
[ As the 100. Psalm.]
[ The Song of the Bl. Virgin. Luc. 1.46.]
MY Soul does magnify the Lord,

My God and Savior; who deserve
The Praises of my heart and voice.
For to his humble Handmaids state,
He showed regard, when 't was deprest;
All Ages shall from henceforth judge
Me Happy, and shall call me Blessed.
He that is Great has done to me
Great things, and Holy is his Name;
His Mercy through all Ages is,
To them that fear him, still the same.
He with his Arm his strength has showed,
Confounded what the proud men thought;
Put down the Mighty from their Seat,
And raised them who are set at naught.
He filled the Hungry Souls with good,
The Full and Rich for want complained;
His Mercy he has called to mind,
And Israel his help has gained.
The Promise to our Fathers made
So long before, in which God stood
Engaged to Abraham and his Seed,
Is all performed and made good.

And thy Mysterious Love disclosed
In all the Peoples view.
All the dark shadows fly away,
Now this bright Sun appears;
Whose saving Light the Gentile World
With unknown comfort cheers.

Make Isr'els Joys abound;
Before with special Favors graced,
But now with Glory Crowned.
