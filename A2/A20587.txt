IMPRENTIT AT SANCTANDROIS BE ROBERT Lekpreuik. Anno Do. M. D. LXXII.

ANE DISCOVRSE TVICHING THE ESTATE present. In October. Anno. 1571.
CALLING to mind (gentill Reidar) the misery intestine quhairof our native
country sustenis the plaigue this day, and the wonderful diversity of
opiniou^is, not only how the same is kendillit and fosterit, bot also quhat
men according to the time thinkis they aucht to do: I am compellit, my
conscience pricking me thairto, to make ane lytill discourse tuiching the same.
For their be sum quhome only ignorance in simplicity withhaldis fra doing
their dewteis, for quhais confort this my travel is specially vndertakin:
febil cowardice drawis vtheris away, notwithstanding they se als cleir as the
Sone at none day quhat is craifit of their dewteis: malicious obstinat pride
and parciall particulariteis makis vtheris both fecht aganis their knawlege
and conscience. And sen my travel is nouther for the proud contempnaris
authoris of this misery, nor for the coward and febill hartit lyby, bot for
the sempill ignorant, I have proponit this discourse be way of Dialogue
ressoning the ground according to ye truth, praying the (gentill Reidar) to
tak it in good worth: For I haif not interprysit it as abilest to discharge it,
bot for that I sa^ greit necessity craifing, and na man put to his helping
hand. And albeit, that nouther the dignity nor reverence of the Author, nor
eloquence nor dispositioun of fair language nor curiosity of matter, quhairin
money delight, sall make this Treaty famous: it reverence it for the verray
treuthis saik, and ow sempill saulis considder how far curious and heich
spreitis abusis ow. Fair weill.

THOMAS AND GEORGE.
THOMAS. GOD blis ow my good friend George.


GEORGE. And God save ow Thomas gif I have na farther Injury of ow.


T. Quhat mean e be that Injury, quhen was I accustomit to Injury ow?


G. ea, not only have I been Iniuryit be them I luikit als lytill of, bot
rubbit, spuileit, weill beatin, and neir slane.


T. Merciful God, quhat heir I, I wald have beleuit yat the reverence of our
gray hairis and excellency of leirning should have been protectiou^ sufficent
for ow, specially of yame of our acque^ta^ce


G. Bot experience hes teichit me the contrair, for professing my self seruand
to God and the King, was sufficient cause, say they, this to demane me, swa
that the lose of my geir, ea, my awin wou^dis greuis me not sa mekle as that
sic persounis quha fumtyme were chief pilleris protectouris, ea, the verray self
doaris and setteris up of the King, and money times sensyne hes had yair handis
armit in sindrie conflictis for his defense, and protectioun of his Authority
and Royal estate, should now make it cause sufficient, not only of my reif and
Injury, bot of the reising, hirrying, stryking, slaying, and drysing to may
vile beggarrie of money thousandis in the bowellis of this miserabill country.


T. Deir friend George, this is the rewaird of sin and impiety, quhairwith
this country ouerflowis.


G. I man outher grant this cause to be sin, or impute vnrichteousnes unto God,
seeing that plaigues never cu^mis bot as Messingeris of God for impiety
committit, and the mair narrowly that I luik quhat this sin should be, or
quhairfra it should proceid, fra ye hiest degree of Nobility to the vile estate
of the pure beggar, their sall nane be found, being diligently tryit, bot in
him only salbe found matter of greitar plaigues nor we sustene this day gif we
were dealt with accordingly, how mekill mair quhe^ every mannis impiety is
intermassit togidder. God grant then that every man may ripe out the plaigues
in him self, and swa cum to amendment every man of ane.


T. Deir friend George e have gadderit weill summarlie sin to be the occasioun
of plaigues, and the tryell of every man in him self, the meanis quhair by God
is appeasit and plaigues ceissis: Bot I pray ow luik e to se at any time that
every man sall sa do, or hes exempillis teichit ow any sic thing heirtofoir.


G. All I grant can not, for the rebellious children of Satan can never call
them selfis trewlie to trial, it is sufficient gif the godly under the
plaigue lift up their hartis and schaik of their auld man.


T. Bot e bring me now to ane heid, the resolutiou^ quhairof I feir e and I
sall not weill aggre vpone easily, forasmekle as our former speikiug hes
vtterit ow to be ane professor of the King and his Authority, quhairby e wald
infer that sic as ar troublit in defense of his actioun e acknawledge to be the
children of God troublit for richteousnes and under his present roddis.


G. es trewly, for I aschame not of my Master under God.


T. On the the other side me think yat they quha sustenis ye part of our Souerane
Lady in defense of her Maiesteis richt tytill and liberty to be the children
of God troublit for richteousnes be ane pak of tressonabill seditious
conspiratouris.


G. Gif e delight to term me^ be odious tytillis mair than familiarly to confer
upon the treuth, think not bot I culd gif vtheris their Epithethes proper
aneuch lytill to our contentment and les to yair honouris.


T. Let our conference then be with modesty, partiality and affectiou^ both
set aside, and let us sp^ik in foro conscientiae.


G. I craif nathing ellis.


T. Quat law permittis, quhat conscience allowis, quhat subiectis heart can
suffer their native Princes oppressed, cassin in vile presoun, spuileit of her
Crown, honouris and dignity, and dreuin for saiftie of her life to seik
protectioun of the cruel enemeis of her Maiesteis self and Predecessouris.


G. And it all this is not sufficient punischment for her impiety.


T. Quhat? will e punische our Princes, sall the fute comptrol the heid or
command it? teiche me that Law.


G. As subiectis violating their faith and detfull obedience to their
Superiouris repyning or rebelling aganis their lauchfull Lawis and
institutiounis, may justly be reknit tressonabill tratouris to god, their
King, and commoun wealth. Euin sa gif they permit ane lascivious and insolent
Prince without any comptrolling to do per fas and nefas, quhat he pleissis,
rekning all thingis lauchfull unto him quhat his corruptit or vnbrydillit lust
listis to attempt, can be na vtherwyse reknit bot tratouris to God, their King,
and commoun wealth. For quhat were it ellis, to think that Princes and
Gouernouris of commoun welthis should not be retenit under Discipline concerning
the state of the country, nor that quhilk Papis hes ascriuit unto them, to
wit, that it is not lauchfull for any mortal man, ^lthocht he thraw ane
hundredth thousand saules ^eidlingis in the hell atanis, it were not lauchfull, I
say, anis to inquyre quhy he sa did, or to call in questioun quhidder he micht
sa do or not, we mon farther understand that the violatioun of the lawis of God
are not only craifit to be punischit in private me^, bot euin in Papis,
Empriouris, Kingis, Quenis, and all estatis of Princessis, forsamekle as in the
giving of the Law na liberty was geuin to sic transgressioun nouther any
exe^ptioun of them quhairby they may be priuilegit. Attour the florisching and
best co^moun welthis yat our Nobill predecessouris hes left mentionat in famous
Cronicklis, teichis not only how insolent Kingis hes been comptrollit of their
Gouernament, bot sum be mature deliberatioun of the counsall of Nobility
co^dempnit to perpetual presoun and yair deceissit. Vtheris degradit of their
digniteis. 2. Cro. Cap. 11. Dardanus King for his Murder and Tyranny
apprehendit be his Nobility and slane: and for the mair terror of all Princes
to govern be tyranny, his body cassin in his awin vile cloisset. 5. Cro. Cap.
6. Conarus lykwise King for his misgouernance degradit be his Nobility,
condempnit to presoun quhair he deit. Vortiger king of England spuileit of his
estait Royal be his Nobility for his misgouernance, and his Sone Vortimer
Crownit and set up in his Crown. 4. Cro. Cap. 7: 6. Cro. Cap. 19. Was not King
Farquhair chargit be ane Herald of Arms to co^peir befoir his Nobility to be
comptrollit of his misgouernance, and for his disobedience apprehendit be his
Nobility, ane other placit in his gouernament, him self impresonit to his last
braith. Gang reid the 11. Chap. of the secund buik of the Cro. and the 15. of
the same, the 15. of the third buik, and thou sall se quhat good exempil of
Nobility, verteous governance, and cair of their commou^ weill our Nobill
Predecessouris hes left us concerning the retening of insolent lascivious and
tyrannous Princes in their unlawful dewteis doing. Bot was this sa mekle as ane
questioun within their 5. eiris to call ane Prince to count, ea, to punische to
ye deith for impiety, remember ow. Participatis not often times innocent
subiectis of the plaigues that God pouris forth for the wickitnes of Kingis and
Princessis? Cryit not David (his pepill being chastosit for his offensis) it is
I o Lord, it is I, quhat hes their Innocent scheip done? How far then appertenis
it to the weilfair of subiectis that their Princes leif godly?


T. Quhen I remember the universal corruptioun of our age, and considderis
lawis and Magistratis that aucht to bring rebellious and insolent subiectis to
ordour, and the^ luikis how be vnbrydillit liberty Princes selfis rin in all
kind of misordour, thinking nathing they do should be mair callit to count nor
they were verray Goddis. My conscience beiris me record, that their Nobility
aucht to put ordour to their insolence, and that both ye lawis of God and
nature allowis the same. Bot albeit I seem to gang with ow thus far generally,
it find I not their circumstances correspondent to the depositioun of our
Maistres.


G. Quhat kind of Impiety I pray ow hes scho co^mittit? Hes scho not
corruptit the Realm with superfluity in cleithing, ryatous and excessive ban
ketting, filthy huredome, pollutit the land agane with Idolatry, quhilk God
of his mercy had anis cle^geit, sic murder as na vile barbariane or cruel
Turk culd do mair unnaturally, to put handis in her awin Innocent husband, and
bring in bed the chief executour of his murder. Now I pray ow wey quhat
caussis been heir. How stand e stupifact? Speik I pray ow and remember our
former promisis.


T. I can not deny in deid, bot me think her part of not be exaggerat sa
heichlie for money causis, and I pray ow Judge with me indifferently, first e
know scho was bot ane barn in eiris nurischit in all kind of welthynes, and
in quhat good estimatiou^ scho was in at her hame cu^ming e know, had seen
lytill or nathing in gouernament of commou^ welthis, and I trow of her awin
nature tractiue aneuch gif scho had had counsallouris cairfuller of her honor
and weilfair of ye Realm nor of beilding housis to them selfis. Swa that I
rekkin not the leist part of this her misgouerna^ce to have cu^it be their
flattrie and dissimulatioun.


G. Not that I will extenuat any part of her former faultis, it am I with ow in
that, yat gif sum of her special counsallouris had been cairfull of her
estimatioun, and never seen in her any thing derogatiue to her honor or
estate, bot straicht said Madame yis is not the way to establische our graces
Kingdom in the Lord, and as ane Father had instructit her in her dewtie,
without beiring flattrie or dissimulatioun, I trow trewlie her cause this day
had not been sa lamentabill, and I dout not bot God this day is craifing that
flattrie at sum of yair handis besides money vtheris their dishonest practisis.


T. Bot good friend George her Authority is takin fra her be her awin
dimissioun, being thairto compellit for feir of her life, quhilk scho renuncit
and annullit sensyne, and ane good part of her Nobility hes found yat scho was
ane silly innocent thing and cryis peccaui. For putting ha^dis in her, or
calling her to account of they former allegeances, and hes establischit her
lieutennentis for erectioun agane of her Authority, and confirmit the same in
Parliament, the Persoun of Flisk (in ane helter) and the secretar sayis it was
bot for ane feche yat they apprehendit her and Crownit her Sone quhill the
Murtheraris of her husband were punischit. And they menit nathing les the^ any
derogatiou^ to her Authority, for scho was als Innocent of her husbandis
Murder as any of them two was, like as their Apology set forth in prent in
her purgatiou^ of that crime beiris.


G. e gif me sa money heidis to answer to that I wat not quhair to begin.
Nottheles I sall keip that ordour in answering that e do in proponing. It is
true the King bruikis his Authority be dimissiou^ of his Mother, ane
inuentioun of they quent curteouris that lykis never to fessin any thing sa
fast bot that they may louse it agane as they se it may serve their turn, for
they settill Courtis at their appetites quhen it may import their commodity
and turnis agane vpsyde down quhen they foirse any storm tending to their
hurt, it is all their alteratiounis nathing ellis bot seiking and establisching
of the co^moun wealth, as the man socht his drownit wife up the watter, and
nathing can be weill done bot that they do may wickitly them selfis: Bot I
trow Robert Maluile ascriuis to him for good service, that he persuadit her to
dimit it, and said it wald be the occasioun they wald tak the les regaird of
her keiping, and swa be sum meanis now or than scho micht eschaip, quhilk anis
doung in her heid scho tuik never kyndlie rest quhill it was accomplischit. As
to her reuocatioun, I ask of ow gif any man had slane our Father and thairfoir
adiudgit to the deith, had heritabillie infeft ow in sum of his landis, and be
that satisfactioun had Redemit his craig fra the aix, wald e think it ane
lauchfull exceptioun to recleame they landis, and say I did it for feir of my
life, attoure this alledgit reuocatioun hes not the solempniteis dew thairto,
to wit, her awin fre liberty, and approbatioun of her Nobility in Parliament
as the Kingis Coronatioun had.


T. I have alledgit confirmatiou^ in Parliament afoir.


G. That Parliament. Is ye Duke, Huntly, and Hwme all the Nobility of
Scotland? quhair their is threttie Erlis and Lordis beside the haill Barrounis
and sa money Burghis as ar fre of their tyranny that avow is continually his
Authority. Quhair was their Co^missioun quhen Robert Scot askit for it?


T. He was the Deuillis wise to put questioun or think their wantit any
formalitie in ye thingis yai did, and their was money vtheris at that Parliament
nor e reknit, Baukcleuch, Farnyhirst, Coldinghame the Bletour of Dunkeld, and
sindrie vtheris be their Commissiounis.


G. Sic lippis sic Latous, sic a Parliament, sic Lordis of Artickles, it micht
weill have been ane Guise agane ule. Bot trow e that ane Law and a leill Sy^e
for mantening of thift and oppressioun, should set Farnyhirst and Baukcleuch
better, nor to be thronit up, to wit, in Parliament. And amangis all other
thingis their is nathing makis them mair odious and detestabill to all men,
and persuadis me^ les of their honest dealing and cair of yair co^mou^ weill,
than that they se the only meanis quhairby co^moun welthis ar brocht to utter
euersioun, yair special gaird and protectioun. Quhat cair is their for the
co^moun wealth quhair sa schamefullie Justice is defait to set them up to
Judge be ane Law in Parliament, worthyer be Parliament to be adiudgeit to ane
thousand deithis. Sall this mocking of lustice with counterfutit Co^missiounis
maid in yair awin Chalmeris void of all manner of ordour and formalitie, not be
plaiguit of God? It sall doutles: Quhat cair is their of the commoun wealth
quhair the Ministeris of Christis Eua^gell ar chaissit away from their flockis,
the house of the Lord appointit for prayer maid ane den of theifis, honest men
drawin fra their housis, their gudis violently takin fra them, the principal
Cietie of Scotland quhair florischit piece, policy, and Justice, thus
miserabillie defacit and maid ane peciabill resset to co^moun theifis,
murtheraris, Ydill vagabundis, exco^municatis, and infinite sic vtheris as for
feir of Justice durst never be seen publictlie.


T. Now George our Choler bristis forth mair irreverently nor can be weill
allowit, for their be sum honorabill men that mislykis fra their hartis that
any sic thing should happin, bot all thingis can not be keipit in frame as the
present state of thingis ar.


G. Bot I pray ow hes not the self same honorabill me^ brocht and presently
haldis all thingis out of frame, and it mo^ they be decorit with famous and
honorabill tytillis as Princes of heich honor and vertew, examinat I pray ow
how their practisis and Interprysis aggreis with their wordis, and let them
have tytillis answering thairto. Bot tell me of they honorabill men (as e call
them) that sa bewaillis this present troubill.


T. Know e not?


G. No trewly.


T. I appeill our conscience gif e trow that the Capitane of the Castle of his
awin nature outher delytis in blude, oppressioun, or troublis in the commoun
wealth.


G. e have schiftit out the evil best amang yame. Bot how can he not be thocht
the verray ground the rute and fosterar of all, seeing he dois all thingis, and
without him is done nathing that is done, for quhat ever the Secretar Inuentis,
straicht way causis he to be put in executioun. Quhat troubill had been in
Scotland throw calling ye Kingis authority in dout, gif he had remanit
constant and keipit that house to the Kingis obedience with ye Wardaris that was
in it, according to his mind that credit him? Is it not him self with the
factioun of the wardaris quhome he lousit at his awin hand hes browin all this
mischief, nouther Hammiltoun, Gordoun, Scot, nor Ker durst have rest the hen
chikkin in Edinburgh had he bot stand indifferent, and not plane enemy to the
honest men of that Town, ea, I wald not have geuin ane caill castok for all
the enemeis the King had in Scotland had he remanit honest in keiping of that
house.


T. Althocht I dout not bot e mean honestly aneuch for our self, it e know not
the merit of causis for they schuik not of the Kingis obedience bot mouit of
conscience that they had done evil in deposing his Mother, and he lousit not
they wardaris without ane warrant.


G. A warrant I grant of the Kingis coniurit enemeis and sic as had na power.
Quha may releif of waird ane man committit to waird be ane Prince culpabill
specially of tressou^? Nane bot ane King.


T. e have interruptit my purpois, I know perfitly quhe^ he lousit they
wardaris the Secreter and he offerit to gar all Scotland acknawlege the Kingis
Authority gif the Queen of Ingland wald make them sure of our Queen not to be
delyuerit to cu^ hame, quhairby they should not incur her indignatioun any
farther, and thairfoir men like men foirseing that danger they thocht it metest
(sen na other apperance their was bot scho should cum ^ame now or then) to tak
her benevolence, and be the hamebringaris of her them selfis, and be that
benefit extinguis all their former offensis, ea, yai had sa far dressed
afoirhand, that gif Scotland wald divorce her and the Earl Both well and be the
procuiraris of the furthsetting of her Marriage with ye Duke of Norffolk, scho
should approve the Kingis Authority her self agane, and interpone the King of
France souertie never to cum in the contrair, nouther ever to cum in Scotland
bot remane with her husband at liberty in Ingland or France.


G. Quhat wise men in the Lord culd of conscience bring her hame agane to be
promouit to dignity, that is sa schamefully dilatit and discouerit of sa
horribill crimes, bot should not rather procure her to be punischit according to
her demeritis, yat the land may be clengeit of blude. Bot I have thy answer in
my self, that is not the purpois of their fetch, bot quha ever compassis their
fetches and beginnis not with God as they have done in this, God sall make them
to acknawlege them, will they nill they or it be accomplischit, and happy is
that interpryse that hes sure fundament approuit of God, for quhatsumeuer
troubill is at the beginning or myddis it bringis comfort in the end. Bot how
can they two aggre, conscience mouit them to set her up agane, because they
have done wickitly in deposing of her, and that upon certane conditiounis
craifit of the Queen of Ingland, they wald have perseuerit in their wickit
handilling of her as they call it, and never maid mai^ conscience of it nor it
had been ane horribill act. The world may se it is not Conscience, it is not
her honor nor erectioun e seik, bot as it may make for our grandeuir, and I
will say that they had done as honestly and be ye apperance of succes of
thingis mair to their profit and quyetnes of the country, gif yai had rune
that course of the Kingis obedience as they begouth, and brocht all Scotland to
do the like as they braggit and bund up ane quiet Commoun wealth, that her
welcum^ame and scho had cu^min should have been na plesander to her nor scho gat
after her delyuerance out of Lochleuin at the Langsyde field, for God is it the
same God gif we had it the same feruentnes. As to that fair ressoun far fischit
afoir the net of the confirmatioun of the Kingis Authority and souertie never
to co^trauene the same for procuring her diuorceme^t to be Maryit with the Duke
of Norffolk, how the keeping of that promeis aggreis with her aspyring mind I
leif it to thy awin Judgment, and gif thou beleifis not that we should have ane
cauld coill to blaw at in seking the King of France of his promeis and
souertischip, gif scho violatit her promeis in that point, as I am may
assurit scho wald.


T. Gif I should speik my conscience, I can na wys^ red me of that laberinth, for
their is na keiping of promysis, subscriptiounis with ^eillis betuix
nichtbouris, mekil les betuix Kingis and subiectis. Bot I will leif of this and
return to our purpois tuiching the Capitane. Gif the Capitane were constant he
micht esilie cast the balance, bot the Secreter and Robert Maluile hes sa
abusit the good nature of that man and led him blindlingis fra ane degree of
defectioun to ane other, sum time dinging in his heid the Quenis delyuerance,
sum time boisting of the Duke of Norffolk, now bringing thousandis and
myleounis out of Spane, than bringing in Frenchemen, that he hes miserabillie
rune him self sa far over the heuch, that he can not find the means to recover
him self agane.


G. I will not say bot they have been evil Instrume^tis, it euin the verray
heich curage and pride of the ma^nis awin new spirit culd not away with being
under obedience to any bot sic as he plesit, or sic as the Secreter micht leid
be the nose, I call it ane new spirit in respect of that famous name, honor,
manheid, fidelity, Religioun, Magnanimity, and constancy, in quhilkis all
conductit be his auld spirit he was marrowles in Scotland, how the spirit
that gouernit him quhe^ he ressaifit yat Castle aggreis with this, Judge e, he
is sa far cha^geit that I can skantlie persuade me he is the self man. Quhat
spirit steirit him up in the beginning of his defectiou^ be ane feineit hand
writ to tak the Secreter forth of their handis to quhome he was committit?
Quhat spirit culd have reuengit ane cuffe geuin to a man of his awin Surname
with the slauchter of ane Innocent man, and ressauit in his special
protectioun the murtheraris of that Nobill Prince his Master, that was during
his dayis the bandstane of mekil quyetnes in yis Realm? Quhat spirit wald set
her up in Authority agane quhome he him self as chief Instrument brocht down
and adiudgeit worthy of ane thousand deithis? Quhat spirit wald contraueue his
awin aith maid voluntarly to his native King, quhair he protestit afoir God
that that hand quhilk subscriuit his Authority should be the last hand vnarmit
in his defense? Quhat spirit culd suffer sa money pietifull cryis of pure
saulis lamentabillie bewailling their miserabill oppressioun? Quhat spirit
culd cry out aganis the Serua^d of God for reproving of impiety? The vengeance
of God licht upon them quhilk of us two i^ the greitest occasioun of blude
schedding. My friend Thomas as God hes lettin the world se cleianeuch be the
succes of thingis quhilk of yame two it is, swa I feir the vengeance sall
follow according to his prayer without spedie repentance.


T. Their be sum thingis their quhilk I allow not bot as to the slauchter of
that man I trow their com^ never thing to him in his lyfetyme mair displesant
howbeit the same was done by his knawlege, and he offerit to satisfy the
party and the Kirk, and how extreme Iohne Knox was to him, and how
irreverently he handillit him is mair nor manifest, and I reckin that to be ane
greit part of the occasioun both of his estait and the countries, for rigorous
and extreme handilling will cause men do money thingis contrair their awin nature.


G. e have said mekill bot to lytill purpois. Think e it to be the office of
the serua^dis of God quhe^ notabill Instrumentis declynis in oppin impiety, to
participat of their wickitnes outher be silence or flattrie, Iohne Knox luikit
mair deiply in that matter nor e ar war of, and saw na acknawlegeing of the
offense done to the Magistrate, quhais satisfactioun aucht to preceid the Kirk,
bot plane contempt as appeirit weill be his awin cu^ming in proper persoun to
the house of Justice at the Regentis elbok, contempteously brak up the same and
tuik out ane of his seruandis apprehendit for the crime, and swa mendit the
first fault with ane other worse. Quhat penitence or satisfactioun outher of
King, Kirk, or party culd the^ have been gadderit? And that severity (as e
call it) quhairwith Iohne Knox handillit him sall accuse money Ministeris and
vtheris that in their hartis dampnis that fact and vtheris their interprysis,
and outher for feir or than flattrie keipis them selfis sa indifferent, that
of their doctrine and prayer they may make ane Welsche ma^nis hois. For gif
richteousnes and true deilling be on their side let Ministeris and all vtheris
Justify, allow, publictly approve and mantene it, gif not, condemn it, cry
out aganis it, threitning the plaigues of God and craif them to be powrit out
on them without spedy repentance, admonische all men to fle fra them as fra
ane consuming pestilence. Heirin standis the part of the true bringeris of
Christis Euangell, and thou that hes done or sall do vtherwyse, and bysseis thy
self mair to pleis men nor him quhais embassage thou beiris, tak thy
admonitioun out of the Reuelatioun to be spewit out of the mouth of God as
nouther het nor cauld. And as e trow yat that severity was ane greit motive to
the kendling of yis fire, I trow and other Ministeris with als greit severity
had cryit out, and threitnit the plaigues, their audacitie had not been sa
greit in atte^pting of thingis, nor it haif braggit, we have als money
ministeris on our side as they have on thairis. Considder thairfoir that over
greit lenity in reproving of sin geuis me^ audacitie and makis them sleip
sound in impiety, and ma declynis in lenity then in severity.


T. e brag mekle of richteousnes on our side, bot will e find me that impiety
with them quhilk is not in the like degree or rather greiter with our selfis,
and it is spokin that our tressoun aganis the King and country may match
thairis as our practisis with Ingland witnessis.


G. I am assurit we mantene ane richteous cause sum time Iudgeit richteous be
our selfis, thocht e now to our perpetual schame wald recent. Bot in deid all
that mantene this richteous cause ar nocht precise richteous them selfis, bot
euin in verrie money thingis ar out of the way. Alswa lat men allow the general
cause and mantene the richteousnes of it, and dampne the particular impiety in
the particularis. And because our laser will not serve to discus that heid as ye
necessity of the same craifis, e sall have it heirefter at mair lenth lytill
to the contentment of ather sides gif they mend not yair handis. As to our
practisis with Ingland, the world seis quhilk hes been may tressonabill, I
know they thunder out aganis us that we are Tratouris to our Country, wald
sell us to be slaves to our auld enemeis of Ingland, put our King and strenthis
in their handis, bot how impudently they belie us, their ^win special
assistaris can beir record. Accusit not ^he Ambassador of France them at
Londoun of ^ntrew deilling to his Master of their offer of the ^elyuerance of
the King to the Queen of Ingland, ^as not our refusal of the King plane cause
that my lord Mortoun come hame without expeditioun of ^^ suit. Quhat culd he
have craifit that he had not ^tenit grantand his delyuerance. Quhat flauerie
should we be exponit unto under the obedience of an Inglis Duke Maryit with our
Queen Enemy to Christis Euangell, and Tratour to his awin Princes, and it gang
they about with tuith and naill to accomplische that fetch, ar they not
eschamit to accuse us of tressoun quhilk them selfis practisis, it is true we
have socht dyueris times the Queen of England to put hand to oppres their
tyra^neis and tressonabill cruelty, tending not only to the euersioun of our
King and her Majesty of both their Realms bot also of the Euangell of Christ
professit thairin, quhilk appeiris mair manifest nor mysteris be spokin of, be
their only confideracie and dependence with coniurit Papistis in Ingland,
France, Spane, ea, ye Pape him self, contributing or promysing to contribute
liberally to the furthsetting of their attemptis, and it mon we be the
Tratouris, for that we will not call bak to our schame that quhilk yame selfis
did with honor, and set her agane over the Kirk of God, that hes subscriuit
that bludie co^spiracie aganis the Sanctis of God deuysit at the counsall of
Trent. Bot supponing now that lauchfullie her authority micht be erectit, should
not sic be appointit thairto in her absence, as be wisdom, foirsicht, Justice,
and verteous gouernament culd auance the Kingdom of God, and intertene the
quiet estait of her subiectis, and preserve the Realm in piece and
tranquillity quhill outher scho or her Sone ressauit it.


T. Quha doutis?


G. Confer with me a lytill then and se how the gouernament that aucht to be
aggreis with it that is, ane verray wise Governor at nuttis craking, and
specially fra two after none bak, that be him self his freindis, and
predecessouris hes practisit their fyftie eiris be murder of the blude Royal
to convert the Kingdom to his awin house, and waittis thou not quhat the heland
man said that he wald do with the Sone quhais Father he had slane. Bot he that
hes slane Grandschir, Gudschir, the Father and the Uncle, quhat rewlit commoun
wealth wald he be glaid to leif the Sone? And in how good cais think e the Sone
were in under his mercy. And sen his practisis tendis to sic middis and end,
quha doutis bot he wald glaidly be the dispatche of the Sone be that degree
neirar. And he is blynder nor ane Ass that seis not their Innocent blude with
the blude of the sanctis of god quhome he hes murtherit plaiguit in him self
and successioun, that of ane fuill is begottin ane nest of Goikis vnabill to
govern them selfis mekill les ane Kingdom, and for all this e mon brag of
their gouernament as Fatheris of the Commoun wealth.


T. Howbeit he is not verray wise, it he is ane greit man and may do mekill,
and for to help his wisdom they have ioynit with him Hu^tly wise aneuch, and
gif their be any suspitioun aganis the King, let him never cum in his handis.


G. Ane greit man I grant, and may do mekill be tressoun, murder, and
oppressioun. As to his coadiutor like to him self, his philnomy in deid
resemblis greit wisdom, and the trik that the Earl Both well and he practisit
at the Kirk of Field to the Father may be witnessing good aneuch of his good
will toward the Sone, find me the way now under sic Gouernouris to keip outher
his throt or his keiparis vncuttit, for to think that he can be keipit but
danger under their gouernament, is als mekill to think thou can hauld ane Wolf
be the eiris but perrell. it I meruel mekill how this ^^^stie freindschip
betuix the Duke, Huntly, the Capitane and the Secreter cu^mis. I am assurit
within their two eiris they were als good freindis as Pylat and Herod afoir
Christis apprehensioun.


T. The thocht of the Commoun weill sa cit them up that they culd find nane
meitar.


G. Meitar meitar wald e say to inuert all and cut the Kingis throt, tusche I
will tell the it is the cheritabill Law that commandis for evil to do good,
because the Duke pat the Lord of Grange Gudschiris heid upon the port, send him
self like ane slave to the Galayis in France, conducit ane disperat knaif to
murder his Master, and for the good service the auld Earl of Huntly thocht to
have done to the Secreter at the Iornay in the North.


T. Now e scorn me.


G. Quhy swa, sa God help me I know not ane good quality nouther in ye Duke
nor Huntly nor ane good turn that ever any of them did to any of the other
two that should muse them, bot and thou list I culd rekin thee infinite
displesuris that they have wischit them with. Bot I trow the ground be the
self ground that sewit up the freindschip betuix Pylat and Herod, for they have
sa defylit them selfis with the blude of the King and his Regentis, that their
commoun cair is how to get ane new successioun to Regne, leist sumtyme yair
bludes be craifit of them or their posterity, for vtherwyse I know their is
na men in Scotland lykis vtheris worse nor wald be glaider to se vtheris
wrakit, gif any of them micht do their turn by vtheris: for the Hammiltounis
sayis gif they culd anis get the Court, the Secreter, Master James Makgill,
Robert Maluile, the Persoun of Flisk, and sic fine Court casteris should never
walter ane Court to them.


T. I can think that weill they will never credit them.


G. Na, na, ane suirer way dispatche them atanis.


T. Bot I tell ow they luik for na les at their handis, and sum of them
thinkis to pay them hame agane, for I know that seiking sum gentill men to ryn
their course that was under unkindness with the Hammiltounis, they willit them
to fray nathing for them, for we sall schaik them of said yai how sone we
have done our turn be them, swa that the Secreteris plane fetcheis the Duke
of Norffolkis, mynding the wrakment ^aith of ye King and the Hammiltounis. And
howbeit he seem to make mekil ado for the Quenis authority, were scho at hame
vncled with the Duke his craig wald be fleitar for the widdie, nor his soillis
for ane naill in the flure, notwithstanding that scho hes promysit gif he be
honest in time cu^ming ^ganis salbe foret.


G. Bot know e gif he can be perswadit to credit that promeis, he is becum
better scholit in his Master Macheauillis principallis, qui peccare no^
pardone, swa gif he can not forgif he can not credit.


T. I am assurit he will seik the last refuge for his standing, for gif he should
wrak, he wald all ye world should wrak with him.


G. Their appeiris na les, for his only standing hes brocht Scotland to the
misery e se, and quhat it hes done in Ingland ma aig es nor ane will remember.
Bot cursit and miserabill is that standing that bringis with it the
distructioun of sa money, and that excellent wit that ^od hes indewit him with
to be occupyit in the advancing of the geuaris gloir, and comfort and
commodity of his native country and brother thus abusit direct contrair God,
sall confound and bring him to miserabill distructioun with all them that
directly fechtis aganis God, employ and all their senses and heich wittis to
^ther endis nor God hes geuin yame for. And thou o Grange, Grange (that thus
schamefully hes sufferit thy self to be abusit with that wickit Ganelon, that
for his cursed standing hes mixed heuin and eirth) afoir honorabill and innocent,
bot now execrabill both to God and man, in that thou hes participat with him,
and that godl^ ^actioun sall taist of the plaigues dew to them for their
detestabill impiety, Repent, repent, I say in time, and call to God to oppin
thy eyis, that thou may se thy awin defectioun, and how greit ane Instrument of
troubill thou art, for that rottin reid thou lenis to salbe na suirer lening
stok now nor afoir. It is not the heicht of craiges thocht they reiche to the
skyis, nor the feirfull thundering of Cannounis, nor the confideracie with all
the Kingis on ye eirth yat sall defend the fra the plaigues of God alreddy at
thy duires, except thou speedily repent.


T. I meruell that e speik their thingis of they men they have been our auld
acquentance, to quho^e e have been money wayis addettit specially to y^ Secreter
quhome e have seen ane profitabill Instrument in honest causis.


G. Let na man think of me that my freindschip co^tinewis langer nor honest and
faithful deilling be banischit. Bot allace sen that blind consait that men
restis on (he was ane good Instrument) had abusit and brocht be apperance na ma
bot him self to distructioun, for he hes houndit and presently houndis the
Nobill men in Scotland like als money tykis forth of a leische, and at the leist
nod of his heid they mon return agane, and in ye mean time him self is ay in
a sure garysoun, it tell me of his honest Interprysi^ ^t brocht not (...) the
advancement of his (...) dignity. Quh^ ^oundit out the King, Mortoun, Ruthuen,
and Lyndesay to stik Dauie, was it for any other cause than that Dauie tuik his
schaddow, fischit in his watteris, and the brybis that he wont to get for
making cruikit materis gang euin, was packit up in his Cofferis. Was not the
distructioun that is cu^min on the Earl Both well brocht about be him only,
for that he feirit his life of him and myntit to retreit his conquest, was it
for the verray haitrent that he bure to the Quenis wickitnes, that he wald have
had Lyndesay quhen scho was taken, wirrie her in her awin hair, and say scho had
ha^git her self, gif it was the mendis scho maid for auld faultis is
Impretensis this day witnessis. Angous, Mortoun, Lyndesay, be leirnit be the
fall of our Nichtbouris, for he lykis not ane compan^ mekill les ane Superior
Nichtbour.


T. I repent I should not have ane better ground for yair defense quho^e I lufe,
for they have banischit from their society the true honest verteous and godly
men, and taken to their league follow is sic a pack as is not out of the
Deuillis arms, I am assurit and the secreitis of yair hartis were rypit, it
should be fund they repent their course them selfis.

Thairfoir I eild, leuing them to their own wisdom sen they will credit na
vtheris.


G. (...) grant they m^nt of their course, not ^kill for that it (...) had ane
evil succes* and like to have worse, as for that it hes been vnnonest in the
self in the sicht of the world, and displesant to God, and than I dout not bot
God sall call them agane to their former feruencie. Vtherwyse I feir their
rewaird salbe confusioun heir and hyne. In the mean time let us pray God
outher to lichtin their eyis to repentance, or ellis to deliver our troublit
brethren fra their Tyranny.


T. Amen.
