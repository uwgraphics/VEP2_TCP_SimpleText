royal blazon or coat of arms HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE By the King.
THe Princely care which We ever bear toward the good government and relief
of Our people, suffers no occasion to pass, whereby We may exercise and
manifest the same; neither is it unknown to Our loving Subjects, by former
Proclamations of this nature, how desirous We have always been to renew and
revive the ancient and laudable custom of this Our Kingdom; whereby Noblemen
and persons of quality, were used rather to dwell and reside in the several
Counties of this Realm, where their principal seats and mansions were; then to
gather to London, and there to remain to the decay of Hospitality, and the
disseruice of the Country: Wherefore taking into Our Princely consideration,
that We being now in Our Journey toward Our Realm of Scotland, resort of
such persons unto Our City will be less needful, but rather that it is far
more convenient, that they abide and continue in their several dwellings in
the Country, to perform the duties and charge of their places, and service;
And likewise by Housekeeping to be a comfort unto their Neighbors; We do
hereby straightly charge and command all Our Lieutenants (except such as be of
our Privy Council, or are commanded to attend upon Us in Our Journey) and
also all Noblemen, Deputy Lieutenants, Knights, and other Gentlemen of
Quality, which have Mansion houses in the Country, That within twenty days
after this our Proclamation published, they depart with their wives and
families out of Our said City of London, and the Suburbs thereof, and return
to their several habitations in the Country, and there continue and abide,
until the end of the Summer vacation: Wherein nevertheless we would have this
Our commandment to be understood, that such as have necessary occasion to
attend here in Our City of London for Term business concerning their estate,
or such as shall have other special and urgent occasions, which they shall
signify and approve unto Our Privy Council, may, during the two next
Terms, or during such other times as their occasions (so to be signified and
approved as aforesaid) shall require, come up and remain within Our City of
London, or the Suburbs thereof, this Our Proclamation notwithstanding. And
because We have heretofore found much remissness and neglect in obeying Our
Proclamations, which are ever published for just and politic causes, and for
the public good; We do therefore admonish all those whom these presents may
concern, to beware, that We have no just cause to make them an example of
contempt for disobeying this Our Royal commandment.

Given at Our Court at Worsop, the eight day of April, in the fifteenth year
of Our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the fiftieth.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. Anno Dom. 1617.
