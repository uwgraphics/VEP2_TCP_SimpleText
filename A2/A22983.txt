Cum priuilegio Regiae Maiestatis.



To the honorable Master THOMAS WILSON, Doctor of the Civil laws; one of her
Majesty's principal Secretaries, and of the most honorable privy Counsel:
Grace and peace in our Savior Christ.
AMong Christians it is and has bin for long continuance an ancient custom,
Honorable, at this time, and at this day commonly of the year, either to
purchase favor, if they have none; or to confirm friendship, which they have,
with gifts and presents. Hence both hie estates, to them of low calling; and
mean persons, to their betters; and every friend to his wel-willer lightly
will send some token, if his ability do serve of a friendly heart and
affection.

In the day two special things are to be observed. One is, that our Savior
Christ was circumcised hereupon; another that the new year begins now. If
we show arguments of love one toward another, for that we have perceived the
love of our Savior to us ward, by his nativity, circumcision, and suffering in
ye flesh for our sakes 1. Pet. 2, verse. 21.
; doubtless our custom is a Christian custom: if otherwise, because the new
year begins, we seek new love, or a renewing of old good will, it is a Civil
custom; commendable in either respect, yet used in both, it better pleases
God.

I therefore hearing of the good opinion, which it has pleased your Honor to
conceive of me, have thought no time could be better than now, by some
present both to thank your Honor for the same, and to crave the continuance
thereof, til by evil demeanor I shall deserve the contrary.

My gift which I do offer is for price of no great value; such as a poor
Student may present. For as the Persians. Aeliamus variae hist. lib. 1.
from the richest to the poorest, would gratify their Kings with gifts and
rewards, some with gold, as Noble men; some with silk, and spices, as
Merchant men; and some too with simple apples, and plums, and such like fruit,
as Husbandmen, who had no better to give: So, though persons of Honor may give
you gold and jewels; merchants velvet, silk, and spices; rich men cost^ie
rewards: yet can a poor la^orer in the garden of Christian knowledge, give no
better than such as he has, apples and plums, even the fruit of his study,
and travel.

Notwithstanding, small for price though it be, I have good hope your Honor will
accept it well in worth, both for the matter it contains, which is so holy;
and for the manner of handling the same by the auctor, which is so heavenly,
that, in my judgment, neither Historia Animalium, which Aristotle gave unto
Alexander the Great; nor that of Cicero De Republica, which Cardinal Poole
sought after with the expense of 2000. crowns R. Ascham Joan. Sturmio, Epist,
l. 1. p. 37. b.
Nor finalie those sibyllian works, that Tarquin. Priscus bought full dearly
of Amalthea Lactant. de falsa sap. cap. 6.
, are so profounde for knowledge; nor many big volumes of Philosophy, for
method so exquisite; nor al ye books of humanity, so necessary for use, as
it is.

Which I do write, neither to dissuade any from the reading of those, nor to
persuade your Honor, to conceive well of this book. For I verily do think,
that both they are commendable, yea, and necessary too, applied to their due
ends; and that your Honor conceaueth better of this, than I by writing can
express, being, as you are, for your wisdom, an honorable Counseler; for
your learning, a reverend Doctor; by your sundry good, and necessary books,
a famous Writer; and for your zeal, a valiant oppugner of sin and wickedness.

But as I think thereof my self: so do I write. In which respect I have not
shunned pains to adorn the same with places of holy Scripture. For, seeing
the book, by perusing it to mine unspeakable both profit and pleasure, to
savor most fragrantlie of the flowers and sentences not of humane, that is vane
wisdom, but of Gods holy word; and to be as holy for phrase, as for matter
holy; being wholly taken out of the holy Scripture: me thought were the
places of Scripture annexed in the margin, it would be ^ quick spur, not only
unto the true Christians zealouslie to read this ancient and godly Father,
when they should see al his sentences in a manner to be nothing but very
Scripture; but also unto Papists, who, neglecting Scripture cleave overmuch
unto this, and other Fathers of the Church, to read the Scriptures, when they
should perceive al his delight to be in using the very words of the holy
Ghost.

Wherefore both for the bringing the Scripture into more credit with all
Papists; and this holy Father with some Protestants; and his method, and
manner of handling the Scriptures, to be a perpetual monument of imitation unto
both, I have added the places (the more willingly through the earnest
instigation of some godly persons, especialie of the Printer hereof, whose
good nature, and zeal, as it is not unknown to your Honor, so is it well
known to the Church of Christ, by his careful, and orderly imprinting good
books) and now have published my doings under the protection of your Honor.

Which my pains, if I shall perceive to be well taken of the godly, chiefelie
of your wisdom, I purpose, God assisting me, to proceed in setting forth
after this same order, not only the auctors Manuel and Meditations, but also
diverse and sundry of S. Augustine his works beside: that the very Papists
may see, though they know it well enough already, that Augustino plurimum
tribuamus, as it is well given out of us R. Ascham. Joan. Sturmio. li. 1. Epist.
page 16. b.
.

But, me thinks, I hear some adversaries among themselves on this wise
speaking, His quoting we condemn not, and his translating we allow, but by his
presumptuous parting of Sentences, and correcting such a Doctor, he plainly
shows, that he is by the one ouer-curious, and by the other a rank Heretic.

May it therefore please your Honor to hear my reasons of doing what I have
done, the which if your wisdom do like, I shall not weigh, what any either
Zoilus of envy, or adversary of malice will think.

Touching my parting of the sentences, I did it upon these occasions: First, to
imitate those good Books out of which they were borrowed, that is, the sacred
Scripture. For surely, in mine opinion, ^t were not well, the Book being most
notably derived out of the pure fountains of Gods holy word, if it were set
forth in any other form, than is the spring from which it flowed.

Secondly, that the Reader might the more sensibly perceive the mind and
method of the auctor. For, I dare say it, by this parting or seuering of the
sentences, a more clear light of the auctors mind will appear to him, who
gladly would understand the same, than when they are confounded, or not
parted.

Thirdly, to offer cause of deep contemplation to the zealous Christian. For
there is no sentence almost throughout the Book, which is vane, but most
heavenly, and able to make even him who is farthest from Christianity, to
occupy his mind with holy and deep meditations. Therefore, albeit they can
be placed in no form amiss, yet then best do they profit, and move the mind,
when they are parted.

Last of al, for the better disposing the places of Scripture by the Printer, I
have divided the sentences. For had the Book bin printed in that letter which
other Books of Meditations, set forth by me, are done withal, as I thought it
would, then should the places, they are so plentiful, never have stood in good
form, nor sight, as in some part of this Book may appear, notwithstanding
the letter be very great, in mine eye, for so small a volume.

Now concerning the second point, it stood me upon, both for my own credit,
and also for the behoof of others, to leave somewhat out. For had I not so
done, I should have said, that the hands of GOD, Manus inquam illae quae
affixae clauis sunt pro me Soliloq. cap. 2.
, did make me: I should have said, that the light which was made, when God
said, Let there be light, was Angelica scilicet natura Soliloq. cap. 8.
: I should have said, that the Angels, as for diverse other ends, so for this
are appointed, Vt orationes filiorum Dei offerant in conspectu maiestatis suae
Soliloq. cap. 27.
. I should have said, that the same Angels do bring Gemitus nostros atque
suspiria ad Deum, vt impetrent nobis facilem Dei benignitatis propitiationem,
and referant ad nos desideratam save gratiae benedictionem Soliloq. cap. 27.
: I should have said, that our Savior descended into Hell, Vti sedebant in
tenebris patres nostri Soliloq. cap. 32.
: I should have said, that Christ ascended, Assumpta secum ex inferis
captiuitate, quam captiuauerat antiquus ille hostis, humani generis inimicus
Soliloq. cap. 32.
: finalie, I should have said, that we ought to doubt, An ad portum salutis
peruenire valeamus Soliloq. cap. 35.
, quia omnia infuturum reseruantur incerta: and so where my purpose was to
edify, I should have destroyed the souls of the weak with erroneous
opinions. Beside, I should have cooled the zeal even of the strongest, when
thinking to proceed in holy meditation, they should find such stumbling
blocks of error cast in their way. And therefore did I judge it better to
leave them quite out, though it grieve the Papists, than to leave them in,
either to the destruction of some, or to the offense of any good Christian:
marueling much why in other English translations this matter has not bin looked
unto ere this, and these faults not wholly, as in part they be, amended.

And here I beseech your Honor, even for Gods glory; the furtherance of the
Gospel; and commodity of this land; that among al abuses which you study to
reform, as a godly Magistrate, and ought to inform her Majesty of, as a
prudent Counseler, you would remember the hurt that comes by corrupt books
in our English tongue. First, they infect the minds of the simple; secondarilie,
they offend the godly; and thirdly, they confirm the obstinate, and the more
a great deal, because they are allowed by public authority, and not either
diligently corrected, or orderly forbidden.

Again, call into mind those books which do more hurt than they, namely, the
enchantments of Circes brought out of Italy, and such ungracious works,
either translated out of Italian into English, or imitating wholly the Italian
invention. Ten Sermons at Paul's Cross Master Ascham in his Schoolmaister.
book. 1. page 26.
, do not so much good for moving men to true doctrine, as one of those books
do harm, with enticing men to il living. Yea, I say further, those books
tend not so much to corrupt honest living, as they do to subvert true religion.
Mo Papists be made by your merry books of Italy, than by your earnest books
of Louaine. This foresee subtle Papists. Page 27.
Therefore when the busy and open Papists abroad could not by their
contentious books, turn men in England fast enough from truth and right
judgment in doctrine, than the subtle and secret Papists at home, procured
baudie books to be translated out of the Italian tongue, whereby ouermanie young
wills and wits allured to wantonness, do now boldly contemn al severe books
that sound to honesty, and godliness. Page 27. b.
Which books open, not fond and common ways to vice, but such subtle,
cunning, new, and diverse shifts to carry young wills unto vanity, and young
wits unto mischief, to teach old baudes new school points, as the simple
head of an English man is not able to invent, nor never was heard of in England
before, yea when papistrie ouerflowed al. Suffer these books to be read, and
they will soon displace al books of godly learning: for they carrieng the wit
unto vanity, and marring good manners, shall easily corrupt the mind with il
opinions, and false judgment in doctrine: first to think il of al true
religion, and at last to think nothing of God himself. And that which is most
to be lamented, and therefore more needful to be looked unto, there be mo of
these ungracious books set out in print within these few months, than have
bin seen in England many score years. And because our English men made
Italians cannot hurt, but certain persons, and in certain places, therefore
these Italian books are made English, to bring mischief enough openly and
boldly to alestates, great and mean, young and old, euerie-where. So that
now they be sold in every shop in London, Page 26, b.
commended by honest titles, the sooner to corrupt honest manners, dedicated
ouer-boldlie to viriuous and honorable personages, the easelier to beguile
simple and innocent wits.

These are the words, as your wisdom smells I am sure, not of a young wit,
but of a grave head; nor of a mean Scholar, but of the best Schoolmaster that
ever England bred, and therefore not lightly to be over passed, nor quickly
to be forgotten, but with earnest endeavor oftentimes carefulie to be recorded,
as good counsel expressed from an hearty good-wil with rare eloquence, tending
to the glory of God, and benefit of this our Country, that neither such as
are well given may be alienated from virtue, nor those which are il bent,
provoked unto wickedness, through baudie, beastly, and blasphemous Books.

Last of al, remember, I humbly once again in the bowels of Jesus Christ
beseech you, remember another abuse that hurts more than both those which I
have already mentioned; namely, profane Plays, publikelie used, set forth
as banners of open defiance to the Gospel, and godliness, and that upon
Holi-daies, yea, and in those places to (I mean the Universities for learning,
and London for resort) which ought to be the Lanternes of godliness unto all the
land beside. Preachers even the grauest for wisdom and years; and the
greatest for zeal and knowledge; and not the smallest for authority,
euerie-where cry out upon them so zealouslie with such grief of heart, that
they are even tired again with crieng. Doctors condemn them Cyril. Catech. 1.
Mystag. Tertul. lib de Spect.
: By shops write against them Saluianus inuenter of the 2. blast of retraite
from plays.
: yea and the best auctors in these days of those wanton, yea wicked toies are
quite out of love with them, and ashamed of their doings Auctor of the 3. blast
of retraite from plays: and also the auctor of the School of abuse.
. Oh that the Magistrate, our sovereign Magistrate I mean, would utterly
forbid them publikelie to be used, that the common people might not haunt them,
and al should be well!

But to return to my purpose from which I have digressed, these errors, I
fear me, have caused many to doubt, whether S. Augustine were ye auctor of
this book; but being left out, as now they are, I cannot see, why S.
Augustine might not make the same, the matter is so heavenly, prayers; the
words so holy, Scripture; every thing so wisely, orderly, excellently done
by the auctor, that he must needs be a most excellent man, whosoever made the
same, and a more excellent than S. Augustine among the Doctors, I think was
never none.

Which being so, I trust I shall ^^t need to request your Honor (...) accept
this book in good part: (...) to request your Honor to par^^n my boldness in
dedicating my ^^ple doings, obscure, as I am, and (...) person unknown to your
Ho^^r, and to bear with my rude ^diousnes, and tedious rudenes, ^aue great
need; and so I hum^^ie do.

The Lord almighty, and King (...) glory, who has cast the eyes (...) his
gracious countenance upon ^^u, abide with you for evermore, and with this new
year power upon your Honor a new increase of his heavenly blessings, Amen.

For the cause, o Lord, why it loves thee not, is, because it knows thee not,
and it knows thee not, because it perceaues thee not; it perceaueth thee not,
because it comprehends not thy light, which does shine in darkness John.1, 5.
, and the darkness co^prehendeth it not.

. For whosoever is a friend of ye world Iam. 4, 4.
is an enemy to God.

O drive away the darkness Genesis 1, 2.
from the deep of my mind, that it may see thee, by understanding thee; and
know thee, by comprehending thee; and love thee, by knowing thee. For
whosoever knows thee, does love thee John. 14, verse. 15. 16. 17.
; he forgets himself Luke 9, 23 24.
; and loves thee more than himself Matt. 10, verse. 37. 38. 39.
; yea, he forsakes himself, and comes unto thee, that in thee alone he may
rejoice 1. Cor. 1, verse. 31.
.

Hence then is it, o Lord, that I love thee not as I ought to do, even because
I know thee not so perfectly, as I should 1. Cor. 13 verse. 9. 10.
; and because I have but little knowledge of thee, I love thee but little; and
for that I love thee but little, I do little rejoice in thee 1. Cor. 1, verse.
31.
. But departing from thee the true and inward joy unto outward, while I lack
thee, I seek fained comforts in these outward things 1. John. 2, verse. 15. 16.
. And so wretch that I am, that which with my whole heart, and with all my mind
Deuteronomy. 6, 5. Matt. 22, 37 Mark. 12, verse. 29. 30.
I should have surrendered unto thee alone, that have I given to vanities; and
so through loving vanity Psalm. 4, 2.
, I am become vane.

Hence also it is, that I rejoice not in thee Phili. 4, 4.
, nor cleave to thee Deuteronomy. 10, verse. 20.
, o Lord, even because I delight in outward, thou in inward Ioh 4, 23. 24.

creature Ps. 13, 95. 13. 14.

Thy workmanship I am. Thy hands have made me Psalm. 119, verse. 73.
, and facioned me.

O Lord, despise not the work of thine hands Ps. 138, 8
; respect the wounds of thine own hands, I beseech thee.

Lo, thou have written me upon the palm of thine hands Esa. 49, 16
: o Lord God, read that writing, and save me.

Behold, I thy creature sigh after thee Psa. 42, 1. 2.

; thou art my maker, oh repair me again. Spare me, o Lord, for my days are
but vanity Job. 7, 16.
.

What is man that he should talk unto GOD his maker! Spare me, o God,
speaking unto thee. Be not angry with thy servant Genesis 18, verse. 30. 32.
for presuming to talk with so mighty a Lord. Necessity has no law. Grief
compels me to speak; and the misery which I endure, enforces me to cry out.

Sick I am, I cry unto the physicion; blind I am, I hasten to the light; I am
dead, and I sigh for life. Thou art ye physicion Mat. 9,12. 13.

him, that he may come unto thee, and see the light in thy light Psa. 36, 9.

But what am I that speaks unto thee? Woe is me, Lord; spare me, o Lord Job.

What am I that speaks unto thee? Woe is me, Lord; o Lord, spare me, a
wretched man Romans 7, verse. 24.

, of short continuance, and full of troble; a man indeed, made like to vanity
Ps. 144, 4.
; compared to the foolish beasts Ps. 49, 12. 20.
; and now in very deed like to them.

And what am I more? a dark dungeon; miserable earth Ecc. 10, 9. 12. Ecc. 17,
33.
; the child of wrath Ephe. 2, 3.
; a vessel of dishonor Romans 9, verse. 21. 22.

Out upon me wretch, what am I? Alas what shall become of me, that am a vessel
of filthiness; a coffin of rottennes; replenished with stinch, and loathsomnes;
blind, poor, naked, subject to very many trobles; ignorant both when I
came, into the world, and when I shall depart Genesis 27, 2 Eccle. 9, 12. Mat. 24,
44. Revel. 3, 3.
; miserable Job. 14, 1.
, and mortal To. 6, 12. 2. Cor. 4, 11
; whose days pass away like a shade 1. Chr. 29, verse. 15. Psa. 102, 11
; whose life vanishes like the moon light; now growing like a flower Job. 14,
2. Psa. 103, 15 Esaie. 40, 6. 7. 8.
on the tree, and by and by withering; flourishing now, fading by and by?

My life, I say, is a frail life, a fleeting life Job. 7, 6. 7.
; a life, that the more it lengtheneth, the shorter it waxes; the more it
increases, the nigher it draws toward death; a life transitory, and
deceitful, replenished with the snares of death Psalm. 18, 5.
.

Now am I iocond, anon sad; now strong, anon sick; now alive, anon dead; now I
seem happy, but am always miserable; now merry, anon mourning. And so are al
things subject unto mutabilitie, that nothing continues at a stay one whole
hour together.

Hence fear, thence trembling; hence hunger, thence thirst; thence cold, hence
heat; hence faintnes, thence sorrow springs, and after al these follows
untimely death, which suddenly does carry miserable men away after a
thousand ways.

This man it kills with sickness, that man it oppresses with sorrow; this man
it famisheth with hunger, that man with thirst it dispatcheth; this man it
choakes with waters, that man it strangleth with an halter. One man it
consumes by fire, another it deuoureth by wild beasts; with sword it
slaieth another; another it corrupts with poison; and with some terrible
fear it dispatcheth some other miserable man.

And yet there is a great misery beside all this: and that is: although nothing
be more certain than death, yet woteth not man when he shall depart Genesis 27, 2
Psalm. 39, 4. ^. Eccle. 9,1.
: and then takes he a fall, and leeseth his hope Job. 8, 13. Pro. 10, 28.
when in his own judgment he stood full sure. For man cannot tell either when,
or where, or how he shall die: yet is it appointed that he shall die Heb. 9, 27
.

Now see, Lord, how great is man's wretchedness, wherein I am, and yet fear not;
how much the misery that I endure, and yet neither am trobled thereat, nor do
cry unto thee? But, Lord, I will cry unto thee before I pass away, if
happily I may abide in thee, and not pass away.

I will tell then, I will tell my misery; yea I will confess my vileness before
thee, and not be ashamed.

Chap. 3.
Of Gods wonderful light.
O Light which Tobit saw, when though blind Tob. 2, 9, 10.
, he taught his son the way of life Tob. 4, 3. 4, etc.
! O light which Izhak saw inwardly, when though outwardly blind Genesis 27, 1
, he told his son what was to come Ge. 27, 28 29.
. O light, I say, invisible, to which al ye depth of man's heart is visible 1.
King. 8, verse. 39. 1. Chr. 28, 9 Eccl. 42, 18. 1. Cor. 4, 5. Reu. 2, 23.
. O light which Jacob saw, when according to thine inward instruction, he
foretold Genesis 49, 1. 2. 3, etc.
what outwardly should happen to his sons.

Behold darkness is upon the face of the deep Genesis 1, 2.
of my mind, y^ art light Luke 2, 32. James. 1, 17

did say, Let there be light, and there was light Genesis 1, 3.
: say likewise to me, Let there be light, and light shall be made, and I shall see
light Psalm. 36, 9.
and discern all that is not light. For without thee I put darkness for light
Esa. 5, 20.
, and light for darkness.

And so without thee there is present for truth, error; for wisdom,
foolishnes; confusion and ignorance for knowledge; for sight, blindness;
by-pathes for the right way; for life, death.

Chap. 4.
The frailty of man's nature.
Behold, my Lord, because there is no life, there is death; naie rather there
is no death, because death is nothing. For thereby we come unto naught, while
we dread not to make our selves naught Ier. 10, 24

And yt deservedly, o Lord. For when we come to naught like the running water
Psalm. 58, 7
, we are recompensed according to our works: because without thee nothing was
done John. 1, 3.
, and we by doing nothing, are made nothing. For without thee, by whom al
things are made Pro. 8, 23. 23, etc. Heb. 11, 3.

Chap. 5.
What is meant by becoming nothing.
I Will confess therefore, o Father, LORD of Heaven and Earth Matt. 11, verse.
27.
, unto thee will I confess my wickedness Psalm. 32, 5.
, that so I may attain unto thy mercy.

I became wretched, and was brought unto nothing, yet knew I not so much; for
thou art the truth Ioh. 14, 6.
, and I was not with thee. Mine iniquities did wound me Ezra. 9, 7. Psalm. 38,
4. 5.
, yet was I not trobled; for thou art the life Ioh. 14, 6.
, and I was not with thee. They brought me unto nothing; for thou art the word
John. 1, 1. Hebr. 1, 2. 3.
, and I was not with thee, by whom al things were made, without whom nothing
was made John. 1, 3.
. And therefore being without thee I became nothing. For it is nothing which
brings unto nothing.

By the word al things were made John. 1, 1. 2.
whatsoever was made, and after what form soever they were made.

And God saw all that he had made Genesis 1, 31. Eccl. 39, 16. 33. Mark. 7, 37.
, and lo, it was exceeding good. Al things yt were made, were made by the
word: then whatsoever things were made by the word, are exceeding good.

Wherefore be they good? Because al things were made by the word; and without
it was made nothing, yt was made John. 1, 3.
. For nothing is good without the sovereign good.

But whereas good is not, there is evil, which indeed is nothing, because evil
is naught else, but the want of good:even as blindness is naught else, but the
want of sight.

Evil then is nothing, because it was made without the word, without which
nothing was made John. 1, 1. 3.
.

And that is evil, which is deprived of that good, whereby al things that are,
were made. But those things which be not, are not made by him. And therefore
they are nothing.

Then whatsoever was not made, are evil. Because al things that were made, were
made by the word John. 1, 1. 3.
. And al which were made by the word, were exceeding good Genesis 1, 31 Eccl. 39,
16. 33.
: wherefore for so much as al things were made by the word, evil things were
not made by it.

So it remaneth, that whatsoever things were not made, are not good: for all
things are good, which were made Ec. 39, 16. 33.
. Therefore the things not made, are evil: and so consequently nothing.
Because without the word nothing was made John. 1, 3.
. Evil then is nothing, because it was not made.

But how is evil, if it was not made? Because evil is a privation of that which
good is, thorough which good was made Genesis 1, 31
. Then to be without the word, is evil; which is to be as nothing. For besides
it, is nothing.

But what is it to be separated from the word? If thou would know that,
listen what is meant by the word.

The word of God says John. 14, 6
, I am the way, the truth, and the life. Therefore to be separated from the
word, is to be without the way, without the truth, without life, and so
nothing without him: and so evil, because it is without the word, by whom al
things were made John. 1, 1. 3.
, and they were excellently good Genesis 1, 31. Eccl. 39, 16. 33.
.

Again, to be separated from the word, by which al things were made John. 1,
3.
, is nothing else but to undo; and of something to become nothing. For without
him it is nothing.

As often therefore as thou declinest from that which good is, thou separatest
thy self from the word. For that is good. And so thou art made nothing,
because thou art without ye word, without the which was made nothing that was
made John. 1, 3.
.

Now then, o Lord my light Mica. 7, 8.
, thou have enlightened me, that I may see thee. I have seen, and known, that
as often as I am separated from thee, so often I become nothing. Because I forgot
goodness Deuteronomy. 32, verse. 18.
which thou art Matthew. 19, verse. 16. 17.
; and therefore am made evil.

Woe worth me wretch that I never marked, how I became nothing when I forsook
thee. But what needs this complaint? If I was nothing, I needed not to know.

We know that evil is nothing; and that is not, which is nothing: and that
which is not good, is not, because it is nothing.

If therefore I was nothing, when I was without thee; I was but as nothing even
like an Idol, which is nothing 1. Co. 8, 4.
, having ears, and hears not Ps. 135, 17 16.
; a nose, and smells not Psalm. 15, 5 6. 7.
; eyes, and sees not; a mouth, and speaks not; hands, and feels not;
feet, and walks not; and all the proportion of members, and yet lives not.

Chap. 6.
How the soul offends through sin.
SO then as long as I was without thee, I was naught but very nothing: and
therefore blind I was, deaf I was, and without sense. For I neither knew what
good was; nor shunned that evil was; nor perceived my wounds when I was hurt;
nor saw the darkness which I was in. Because I was without thee, the very light
John. 1, 4. 9.
, which lightneth every man that comes into the world.

Alack therefore, they wounded me, yet I sorowed not; they haled me, yet I
perceived not, for that I was not; because I was without life John. 14, 6.
, which is the word John. 1, 1. 3.
, by whom al things were made.

And therefore, o Lord my light Esa. 60, 19. 20.
, mine enemies did with me even what they would; they struck me; they striped
me; they polluted me; they corrupted me; they wounded me; yea they killed me:
because I forsook thee Hos. 7, 13.
, and so became nothing without thee.

Alack, o Lord, my life Ioh. 11, 25. John. 14, 6.
by whom I was made Genesis 1, 26. 27. Job. 33, 4. Colos. 3, 10.
; my light John. 8, 12. 1. John. 1, 5. 7.
, whereby I am directed Luke. 1, 79.
, have mercy upon me Psalm. 41, 10.
, o defender of my life Psalm. 22, 19. 20.
, and raise me up again, o Lord my God Psalm. 18, 1. 2, etc.
, my hope Psalm. 91, 2.
, my strength Exo. 15, 2.
, my rock, and my comfort in the day of my troble Psa. 59, 16. 17.
. Consider mine adversaries Psa. 25, 19. 20.
, and deliver me Psalm. 18, 17. Psalm. 59, 1. 2.
; let them which hate me Psalm. 68, 1.
fly away from my presence, and through thee let me live in thee.

For they have watched me Psa. 37, 32.
, and seeing me without thee, have despised me. They parted among themselves the
garments Psa. 22, 18.
of virtue, wherewithal thou had clothed me; they made a way through me;
they troade me under their feet; they defiled thine holy temple Psalm. 79, 1.
with the dregs of wickedness; they left me desolate, pining away through
sorrow. I followed after blind, and naked, and shackled with the cords Pro. 5,
22.
of wickedness. They dragged me after them in their circuit from vice to vice;
and from mire to mire; and so went I full weakly, God knows, before the face
of him that pursued me.

Bond I was, yet liked I slavery; blind, and desired blindenes; bound, and
did not abhor the shackles. I thought sour sweet, and sweet to be sour Esai.
5, 20.
.

Miserable I was, yet knew I not so much: because I was without the word,
without which nothing was made John. 1, 3.
, through which al things are maintained, without which al things are brought
to nothing.

For as al things by it were made John. 1, 3
, and without it was made nothing: so by it are al things maintained,
whatsoever is either in heaven, or in the earth; in the sea, or in any deep
place. Neither can any part stick to other either in a stone, or in any other
thing created, did not the word, by which al things were made, maintain it.

Wherefore, o word, I will cleave to thee Psa. 73, 28
that thou may save me. For when I forsook thee, I had perished; had not
thou, which did make me Genesis 1, 26. 27. Wisd. 2, 23. Eccles. 17, 1. 2.
Colos. 3, 10.
, renewed me again.

I sinned, thou did visit me Psalm. 8, 4. Acts. 15, 14.
; I fell, thou did erect me Psa. 37, 24.
; I was ignorant, thou did teach me Psalm. 71, 17. Psalm. 94, 10. 12.
; I was blind, thou did lighten me John, 1, 9.
.

countenance, that I may enter, and behold, and know, and praise thee with all
mine heart. For great is thy mercy toward me Psalm. 86, 13

O Lord our God, how excellent is thy name in all ye world Psalm. 8, 1. 9.

did love me first 1. Ioh. 4, 19.

And whence is it, o Creator of heaven Este. 13, 10. Esaie. 51, 13.

O wisdom, which openest the mouth of the dumme Wis. 10, 21.
; o word, by whom al things were made John. 1, 1. 3.
, open my lips Psalm. 51, 15.
, give me a voice of thanksgiving Psalm. 26, 7.
, that I may utter out all the benefits, which thou Lord, have bestowed upon
me, even from the beginning.

For lo I am, because thou have created me Genesis 1, 27. Job. 33, 4. Psalm. 100,
3. Eccles. 17, 1. 2. Colos. 3, 10.
. And the cause why thou did create, and number me among thy creatures, was
thy predestination from everlasting Romans 8, 29. 30.
, before thou made any thing from the beginning Pro. 8, 23. 24. 25. 26, etc.
, before thou did spread abrod the heavens, when there were no depthes;
neither had thou made the earth, nor settled the mountains; before the
fountains abounded with water. Before al these things which by thy word thou
did create John. 1, 1. 3.
; thou in thy most certain providence of truth, did foresee that I should
be, yea thy mind was to make me thy creature.

And whence then is it, o my Lord Baru. 2. 11. 12.
, o gracious and most hie God Psalm. 113, 5. 2. Esdr. 7, 62.
, whence is it, o most merciful Father Psa. 27, 10. Esaie. 63, 16. Luke 6, 36.
, most mighty Creator Ecc. 16, 18. 19. Eccles. 17, 1. 2. 3, etc.
, and always loving Psa. 27, 10.
? What deserved I at thy hands, what goodness saw thou in me, that moved thy
most glorious majesty to create me?

When I was not, thou did create me Genesis ^, 27. Colos. 3, 10.
. I was nothing, and of nothing thou did make me somewhat Psa. 100, 3. Wisd.
2, 23.
.

And what kind of somewhat? Not a drop of water; not fire; not a bird, nor a
fish; nor a serpent; nor a brutish beast; nor a stone, nor a stock; nor of
that kind of things which have only but being; nor of that whose nature is
only to be, and to grow; nor of that which have only being, growing, and
sense. But above al these things, it is thy will that I should consist both of
those things which have but only being, for I am; and of those things which
as well grow as be; for I am, and grow: and of those things also which have
being, growing, and sense; for I am, grow, and perceive.

And yet more than this, thou have made me a little inferior to the Angels Hebr.
2, 7.
: For I have received reason at thine hands to know thee, as well as they.

A little inferior I confess. For they have an happy knowledge of thee, even
as thou art, but I know through hope: they face to face 1. Co. 13, 10 12.
, but I dark-lie through a glass: they fully, but I in part.

Chap. 8.
The happy state of man in the life to come.
But when y^ which is perfect is come 1. Co. 13, 10 12.
that in part shall be abolished; when with open face 2. Co. 3, 18
, we shall see thy face.

Then what shall let us to be as good even as Angels Heb. 2, 7. Psalm.8, 4. 5.
, seeing thou, Lord, have bedecked us with ye crown of hope, which is adorned
with glory and honor; and seeing thou have exceedingly advanced us as thy
very friends.

Yea every way as good then, and equal to Angels. For so says thy truth;
They are equal unto the Angels Luke. 20, verse. 36.
, and are the sons of God.

What are they else but the sons of God, if they be equal unto Angels? Indeed
they shall be the sons of God; because the son of man is made the son of
God.

So that considering this thing, I dare boldly say, Man is not a little
inferior unto Angels Hebr. 2, 7.
, Man is not only equal unto Angels Luke. 20, verse. 36.
, but man is above Angels. Beeause a man is God Mat. 1, 23. 16. Luke. 2, 11.
, and God is a man John. 1, 14.
, but not an Angel.

And because the word which was in ye beginning John. 1, 1.
God with God; the word whereby God said, Let there be light Genesis 1, 3.
, and light was made; the word by which al things in the beginning were made
John. 1,3.
, became flesh John. 1, 14.
, and dwelt among us, and we have seen the glory thereof, I say man is the
most excellent creature of al other.

Behold my glory, in which I glory Ier. 9, 23.
at what time soever I do glory; Lo my joy, wherein I rejoice Phili. 4, 4.
, when I do rejoice, o Lord, my God, my life Psalm. 42, 8.
, and the whole glory of my soul.

Therefore, o Lord my God, I confess that creating me a reasonable creature,
thou did create me after a sort as good as Angels. For by thy word I may be
made perfect, so that I may attain unto the very state of Angels, and have
the adoption of sons Romans 8, 15 Galat. 4, 5. Ephesians. 1, 5.
, by thine only begotten son, o Lord, thy wel-beloued son Matt. 3, 17.
Matthew. 17, 5. 2. Pet. 1, 17.
in whom thou art well pleased; by thine only and right heir Romans 8, 16. 17.

and coeternal Heb. 13, 8.

, our Advocate with thee 1. John. 2, 1.
, and the light of our eyes John. 8, 12. 1. John. 1, 5, 7.
; who is our life John. 5, 21. 24.
, and our Savior Matthew. 1, 21. Luke. 2, 11. Act. 4,12.
, and our only hope Col. 1, 27. 1. Tim. 1, 1.
; who has loved us more than himself John. 15, 13, Ephesians. 5, 2. 1. John. 3,
16.
, by whom we have an assured trust laid up in store with thee Ephesians. 3, 12.
, and free access unto thee Heb. 4, 16.
. Because he gave them power to be the sons of God John. 1, 12
, to them I say that believe in his Name.

I will praise thy name, o Lord, who by creating me after thine own image and
similitude Genesis 1, 26. 27. 1. Cor. 11, 7.
, have made me capable of so great glory, as in time to become the son of
God John. 1, 12. Romans 8, 15. 16. 17.
.

This condition neither trees, nor stones, nor generalie those things which
either move, or increase in the air, or in the sea, or in the earth attain
unto; because he gave them no power by thy word, to become the sons of God
John. 1, 12.
; for they have no reason. For in reason consists the power, whereby we
know God. And this power he has given to men, whom he has made reasonable
after his own image, and likeness Genesis 9, 6. Colos. 3, 10.
.

I also, o Lord, am a man thorough thy grace, and by thy grace may be thy
son, which they cannot be.

Whence have I it, o Lord, the sovereign truth Ioh. 14, 6.
, and true souereigntie, even the first borne of every creature Col. 1, 15.
16. 17.
; whence have I it, that I may be ye son of God, which they cannot be?

Thou art the same God for ever Lame. 5, 19 Dan. 6, 26. Baruc. 4, 10. 14, etc.
, thou made al things Genesis 1, 1. 2, etc. John. 1, 3.
; thou did create both man Genesis 1, 26. 27. Psalm. 100, 3. Wisd. 2, 23. Eccle.
17, 1. 2. 3, etc.
, and beasts Genesis 1, 24 25. Ierem. 27, 5.
, and stones, and al green things upon the face of the earth Genesis 1, 11 12.
Job. 38, 25. 26. 27, etc.
. For no merits went before, nor deserts. Because only of thy goodness thou
createdst al things. Al creatures were like in merits. For none at al deserved
ought.

How is it then that thy mercy does more appear in this thy reasonable
creature, than in all the rest which have no reason? Why am not I, as al they
be; or else al they as I; or I alone as they? What merits had I? what had I
deserved? that thou should create me of power to become the son of God
John. 1, 2. Romans 8, 15. 16. 17.
, and deny the same to al thy other creatures?

Be it fro me, o Lord, that I should think I had any merits. It was only
thy grace; it was of thy mere goodness, that I should be partaker of that
sweetness.

Wherefore through that grace which moved thee to create me of nothing Job. 10,
8. Job. 33, 4. Psalm. 100, 3. Ps 119, 73.
, o Lord, give me this grace, I beseech thee, that I may thank thee Psalm.

for this thy goodness.

Chap. 9.
Of Gods Omnipotency.
THine Almighty hand, o GOD, which is one, and the same always Mala. 3, 5.
, has created both the Angels, in heaven, and the little worms in earth Genesis
1, 24 25.
, no whit more glorious in them, nor inferior in these.

For as none other hand could create an Angel; so none other could make the
vilest worm: as none other could lay abroad the heavens Job. 9, 8. Psalm. 104.
1, 2. 3, etc.
; so none other facion the smalest leaf of a tree: as none other could make a
body; so none other make one hear white or black Matthew. 5, verse. 36.
: But only thine almighty hand, to which al things are alike possible Matthew.
19, verse. 26. Mark. 10, 27 Mar. 14, 36. Luke 18, 27.
.

For it is no more possible for thee to create a worm, than an Angel; nor more
impossible to spread out the Heaven Esai. 42, 5.
, than a leaf: It is no easier for thee to facion a small hear, than a big
body; nor harder to build the earth upon the water Psa. 104, 5 6.
, than to lay the waters upon the earth. For thou God did what thou
would Job. 23, 13 Psalm. 115, 3.
in Heaven and in earth, in the sea, and in all the depthes Psa. 135, 6.
, and me among other things thou did make even as thou would, could,
and knew best.

Thine hand, o Lord, could have made me Matthew. 19, verse. 26. Luke 18, 27.
a stone, or a bird, or a Serpent, or some brute beast: it knew as much, but it
would not for thy mercy sake.

Wherefore then am I not a stone, or a tree, or a beast? Because thy goodness
has so ordained. Yet did not any merits of mine prevent thee, that thou
should appoint it so.

Chap. 10.
The incomprehensible praise of God.
WHere shall I get, o my Lord, where shall I get sufficient praises to extol thee
Ps. 106, 2.
?

For as thou made me Ps. 100, 3.
as it pleased thee, without mine help: so can thou magnify thy self, as it
pleases thee, without me.

Before thee, o Lord, thy praise is thy self. Let al thy works praise thee
Song of ye three children. ver. 57.
, according to thine excellent greatness Ps. 150, 2.
. Thy praise o LORD, is incomprehensible Ps. 106, 2.
. It is neither in heart conceived; nor uttered by mouth; nor perceived by
care. For these things do pass away Esai. 40, 6. 7. 8.
: but thy praise, o Lord, endures for ever.

The thought has a beginning, and it has an end; the voice has a sound, and
the voice does vanish; the ear does hear, and hearing cesseth: but thy
praise, o Lord, endures for ever.

Who then can praise thee! what man can show forth thy praise Ps. 106, 2. Ec^.
43, 30. 31.
! Thy praise is not transitory, it endures for ever.

He does praise thee, who beleceueth thee to be thine own praise. He does
praise thee, who knows himself unable to attain unto thy praise. O
perpetual praise, never vanishing; in thee is our praise, in thee shall my soul
rejoice Ier. 9, 23. 24. 1. Cor. 1, 31
.

We praise thee not, but thou praisest thy self, by thy self, and in thy
self: and our praise also is in thee.

Then have we true praise, when we have praise of thee 1. Cor, 4, 5.
; when the light does allow the light. For thou the true praise Deu. 10, 21
Psa. 118, 14. Esaie. 22, 2.
give due commendation.

And as often as we seek praise of any other besides thee Roma. 2, verse. 29.
, so often do we leefe thy praise. Because that is transitory, but thine is
eternal. If we go after transitory, we forgo eternal: and if we love eternal,
we must loath y^ praise that is transitory.

O Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1 3.
, praise eternal De. 10, 21.
, of whom al praise, without whom there is no praise, without thee I am
unable to praise thee: let me have thee, and I will praise thee.

For what am I, Lord, of my self that I should praise thee! dust and ashes am
I Ge. 18, 27.
; a dead, and stinking dog 1 Samuel 24, verse. 15. 2. Sam. 9, 8.
am I; a worm Job. 25, 6.
, and very rottennes am I.

What am I to praise thee, o Lord God most mighty Est. 14, 19. Iere. 32, 18.
, in whose hand is the breath of al mankind Job. 12, 10
, which inhabitest the eternity Esa. 57, 15.
!.

Shall darkness praise the light; or death, life? Thou art light Ioh. 8, 12. 1.
Ioh. 1, 5. 7.
, I am darkness; thou life John. 14, 6.
, and I am death. Shall vanity commend the truth? Thou art the truth John. 14, 6
, but I a man become like to vanity Psa. 144, 4
.

Why then, Lord, shall I praise thee? Shall my misery praise thee? shall stincke
commend sweetness? shall man's mortality Wisd. 7, 1.
, who is here to day, and gone to morrow Ecc. 10, 11.
, praise thee?

Shall man who is very rottennes, or the son of man a very worm Job. 25, 6.
, praise thee?

O Lord, shall he that is conceived Psa. 51, 5.
, borne Job. 14, 4.
, and brought up in wickedness praise thee? no my God. Praise is not semelie in
the mouth of a sinner Ecc. 15, 9.


O Lord my God, let thine own incomprehensible power Esai. 44, 6. 7. Psalm.

Chap. II.
The hope of a Christian must be cast upon God.
ANd I thy creature Genesis 1, 26. 27. Psalm. 139, 14. 15. Colos. 3, 10.
, will trust in the shadow of thy wings, Psa. 57, 1.
, even in thy mercy whereby thou did create me.

Help thy creature, whom of thy mercy thou have created; let me not perish
through my sin, whom of thy goodness thou have facioned; neither be
confounded in my misery, whom of thy clemency thou have made.

For what profit is in creating me, if I go down into mine own corruption?
what? have thou, o God, created the sons of men in vain Psa. 89, 47
?

Thou have created me Ps. 100, 3. Wisd. 28 23.
, o Lord, govern that which thou have created. Despise not, o God, ye works
of thine hands Psa. 138, 8.
.

Of nothing thou did create me Genesis 1, 26.
, and doubtless do not thou Lord direct me, I shall come again to nothing.

For as I was not sometime, and thou did make me of nothing Esa. 40, 28
: so Lord, if thou do not govern me, I shall return to nothing in my self.

Help me, o Lord Chro. 14 verse. 11. Psalm. 70, 5. Psa. 109, 26.

, lest I perish in my wickedness Psa. 94, 23
.

O Lord, had not thou created me, I had not bin at al: but because thou have
created me, I am. And yet am I nothing, if thou guide me not. For no grace
neither goodness of mine compelled thee to create me, but even thine own most
favorable goodness, and mercy.

O Lord my God Psalm. 99, 8. 9. Esaie. 41, 13. Matthew. 4, 7. 10.
, let that love which compelled thee to make me, compel thee also to govern
me. For to what end did thy love compel thee to make me, if I perish in my
wickedness Ps. 94, 23.
, and am not guided by thy right hand Psa. 89, 13.
?

Let that mercy of thine, o Lord my God Psa. 140, 6 8. Luke. 4, 12.
, compel thee to save that which is created, that compelled thee to create that
which was not. Let that love win thee to save, which wanne thee to create.
For it is no less now than it was; for so much as thou art love 1. Ioh. 4, 8.
, who art always the same Ps. 102, 27. Hebr. 1, 12.

, wherewith the whole world is replenished. Which thing S. John did see, and
passed not over the same in silence, when he said 1. Ioh. 2, 16.
, For all that is in the world is either the lust of the flesh, the lust of the
cies, or the pride of life.

Behold, o Lord my God Psalm. 99, 8. 9. Esaie. 41, 13. Luke. 4, 8. 12.
, the whole world is full of the snares of concupiscence, which they have
prepared for my feet Psalm. 57, 6. Psalm. 142, 3.
, and who ca^ escape them!

Even he doubtless, from whom thou take the lofty looks Ecc. 23, 4. 5. 6.
, that he be not taken by ye lust of the cies; from whom thou take carnal
co^cupisce^ce, that he be not taken by the lust of the flesh; and from whom
thou take a bold and impudent mind, that the pride of life do not slilie
deceive him. O most happy man for whom thou do these things, for doubtless
he shall go unpunished!

Now then, o my redeemer Job. 19, 25 Esai. 44, 24.

adversaries, being taken by ye traps which they have set for my feet Psalm. 57,

Chap. 13.
Of man's misery; and of Gods benefits.
O Light 1. Ioh. 1, 5. 7.
! o cleerenes, whom none other light or clerenes does behold! o light which
darckeneth al light! o cleerenes which dimmeth al strange light! o light, from
which al light! o cleerenes, from which al cleerenes does proceed! o cleerenes
in respect whereof al other brightness, is but darkness; and al other light but
dimnes!

Where thou shinest, the very darkness is bright as day; and dimnes, is light.

O most sovereign light, whom no blindness can darken; nor mistines dim; nor
darkness obscure; nor any let close up; nor shadow keep away!

O light, which inlightenest al things at one time, together, and always,
swalow me up into the depth of thy brightness, that I may on al sides behold
thee, both in thy self; and me in thee; and al things under thee.

Forsake me not Psalm. 27, 9. Psalm. 71, 18.
, o Lord, least the shadows of mine ignorance do increase; and mine offenses
multiply.

For without thee every thing is darkness to me, and al things are evil:
because nothing is good without thee the true, only Mat. 19, 16 17. Mark. 10,
17. 18. Luke. 18, 18. 19.
, and sovereign good Iame. 1, 17.
.

This I acknowledge, and this I know, o Lord my God Psalm. 99, 8. 9. Esaie. 41,
13.
. For be I in any place without thee, evil is it with me having not thee, not
only outwardly to my body, but also inwardly to my soul: because al
abundance being not with thee my God, is but beggerie; but when thy glory
apeareth Psalm. 17, 15.
, I shall be satisfied.

And, o Lord, my blessed life Psa. 42, 8. Eccle. 23, 4. John. 14. 6.
, grant that I may confess my wretchedness unto thee Psalm. 32, 5.
: for from thee the sovereign Iame. 1, 17.
, and very good Luke 18, 18 19.
it self, and from the unity of thy goodness, has the diverse kinds of
temporal things separated me being fallen into sin through carnal senses, and
from one it has parted me into many things: so that abundance to me was
combersome, and poverty was plenty, while I haunted after this and that, and
yet could never be satisfied; for in my self I found not thee the unchangeable
Romans 1, 23. 1. Tim. 1, 17.
, and singular Matt. 19, verse. 16. 17. Mark. 10, 17. 18.
, and inseperable, and only good, which had I once atteined, I should want
Reu. 7, 16. 17.
no more; which had I once found out, I should weep no more Reu. 21, 4.
; which did I once enioie, mine heart would be at rest.

Oh misery upon misery, since my miserable soul does fly from thee, with
whom she has abundance 1. Cor. 2, 9.
, and joy Reu. 7, 16.
; and follows the world, with whom she has poverty Luke 16, 25.
, and sorrow Luke 6, 25.
!

The world cries, I vanish Esaie, 51, 6. 2. Peter. 3, 5. 6. 7. 1. John. 2, 15.
16. 17.
; o Lord, thou criest, I refresh Mat. 11, 28 29. 30.

refreshes. This verily is my weakness.

O Physicion of the soul, cure it, that I may praise thee, even the salvation;
of my soul Psalm. 35. 3. Acts. 4, 12.

refreshed me even fro my youth Psalm. 71, 5.

Cast me not off Psa. 71, 9.

came down Ioh. 3, 13. John. 6, 33. 38, etc. Ephesians.4, 8. 9. 10.
unto thy servant; and to redeem thy servant thou did give thy self Romans
4, 25 Romans 8, 32. Galat. 2, 20. Ephesians. 5, 2. 25.
; and that I might live, thou did die Roma. 5, verse. 6, etc. 1. Cor. 8, 11
1. Cor. 15, 3
, and overcome death 1. Cor. 15, verse. 25. 26, etc 2. Tim. 1, 10.
.

When thou did humble thy self Phili. 2, 6. 7, etc Hebr. 2, 9.
, thou did exalt me. I was lost; I followed after wickedness; I was a
bondslaue to Satan: but thou wart sold for me Mat. 27, 3. 4. 5. Acts. 1, 16.
17, etc.
to redeem me; and so thou louedst me Ioh. 15, 13 Ephesians. 5, 1. 2. 1. Ioh. 3,

that thou gave thy blood a ransom for me 1. Pet. 2, verse. 24, etc. Ephesians.

O Lord, thou have loved me more than thy self Romans 5, 7. 8.
; because for my sake thou would needs die 2. Co. 5, 14 15. 1. These. 5, 10
.

On such wise, and with so dear a price thou have brought me home from
banishment Heb. 11, 13 16.
; redeemed me from bondage Gal. 2, 4. Galath. 5, 1. 13.
; withdrawn me from punishment Esai. 53, 3. 4, etc.
; caled me by thy name Reu. 14, 1. 11. Reave. 22, 4.
; and sealed me with thy blood Reu. 7, 3.
, that I should evermore have thee in remembrance, and never forget him, who
for my sake shunned not the cross Gal. 3, 13.

Thou have anointed me with that oil 2. Co. 1, 21
wherewith thou wast ointed, that of thee Christ I might be called a Christian
Act. 11, 26 Acts. 26, 28. 1. Pet. 4, 16.

Lo, thou have written me upon thine hands Esa. 49, 16
, so to have me in remembrance, if so be co^tinualie I have thee in mind. And
thus alwaie thy favor, and thy mercy have prevented me Psa. 59, 10
. For out of much and great perils thou have delivered me oftentimes Ps. 124,
6. 7. Eccl. 51, 1. 2, etc.
, o my savior Psalm. 18, 1. 2. Dan. 6, 27.
.

When I have wandered, thou have reclamed me; when I have bin ignorant, thou
have instructed me; thou have corrected me, when I have sinned; when I
despaired, thou have comforted me; when I fell, thou have raised me; thou have
vphelde me, when I have stood; when I have traueled, thou have guided me; when
I have come home, thou have received me; thou have watched me, when I have
slept; and when I have cried, thou have heard me.

Chap. 14.
That the eyes of the Lord, are continualie upon the doings, and cogitations of
men.
FOr these, and many mo good turns have thou done me, o Lord my God Psalm. 7,
1. 3.
, the very life of my soul Psalm. 42, 8. Eccle. 23, 4. John. 14, 6.
.

And doubtless it should be a pleasure to me not only to talk, and think
always of them, but also evermore to thank thee Ps. 116, 12 13. 17. 18.
, to praise thee, to love thee for all thy good things, and that with all mine
heart Deuteronomy. 6, 5. Deu. 11, 18. Mat. 22, 37. Luke 10, 27.
, and with all my soul, and with all my mind, and with all my strength, yea from
the very pith and intrals of mine heart, and of al my iointes, o Lord my God
Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
, the blessed sweetenes of al which delight in thee.

But thine eyes have seen mine imperfection Ps. 139, 16
; thine eyes I say are much brighter than ye Sun Ec. 23, 19
, beholding al ye ways of men, and the ground of the deep, and in every
place at al times look both upon the evil and the good Pro.15, 3.
.

For sithence thou rulest al things Psalm. 47, 1. 2. 6. 7. 8. Matt. 11, 25
, fillest al things Ier. 23, 23 24.
, art always wholly every where Ps. 139, 7. 8, etc.
; yea sithence thou have a care of al things that thou have created (for thou
hate nothing which thou have made Wisd. 11, verse. 21.
:) thou do so behold my ways and my steps Job. 31, 4.
, and so watch and ward night and day for my safety, looking so narowly unto
al my paths Job. 13, 27
, like a continual watchman Psa. 121, 4 Psalm. 127, 1.
, as though thou hadest forgot thine other creatures of heaven and earth, and
hadest cast al thy care upon me alone, having no care at al of the rest. For
the light of thine unchangeable sight neither increases, do thou see but one;
nor diminishes, if thou behold infinite and diverse things. For even as at one
time thou considerest the whole perfectly together: so does thy whole
countenance behold at one time al particulars, although diverse, and that
perfectly, together, and wholly. Yet see thou al things as one thing, and
one thing as al things: for thy self art whole, and can neither be divided,
changed Iam. 1, 17.
, nor diminished.

And therefore thou being whole in all time, and without time, do behold me
wholly, together, and always, even as though thou had naught else to
consider of. Yea, so thou stand upon my guard, as though thou would
forget al other things, and bend wholly to me alone. For always thou show
thy self present, and offerest thy self ready at al times unto me, if thou
find me ready to receive thee.

O my Lord, go I where I will, thou will never forsake me Ioshu. 1, 9. Hebr. 13,
5.
, unless I forsake thee first.

Wheresoever I become, thou leauest me not. For thou art every where Job. 23,
8. 9. 10. 13. Psalm. 139, 7. 8. 9. 10. 11. Iere. 23, 23. 24.
. So that to what place soever I go, I may find thee, by whom I may be; that I
perish not without thee, because without thee, I cannot be.

And therefore I confess indeed, that whatsoever I do, and wheresoever I do
it, I do it in thy presence Ecc. 23, 19. 20, Psalm. 139, 10. 11. 12.
; and that whatsoever it be which I do, thou see it better than I which do
it.

For when I do aught at any time, thou art present at al times, as a continual
beholder of al my thoughts 1. Kings.8, verse. 39. 2. Chr. 6, 30. Psalm. 44, 20.
21. Prou. 24, 12. Luke. 16, 15.
, intentions, delectations, and doings.

O Lord, my sighing is not hid from thee Psalm. 38, 9.
; and my very thought is open to thy sight Job. 42, 2. Psalm. 94, 11. Psalm.
139, 2.
.

Thou know, Lord, whence the spirit comes, where it is, and whether it
goes. For thou art the trier of al spirits Pro. 16, 2.
.

Also, thou best know inwardly, whether the root of that tree which has
fair leaves be sweet or sower; yea, thou narowly do search the very pith
of the roots; and by the most evident truth of thy light, thou gatherest,
numbrest, considerest, and sealest not the intent only, but the very pith
also of the root thereof, that so thou may estrender unto every man not only
according to his works Psa. 62, 12. Prou. 24, 12. Iere. 32, 18. 19. Hosea. 4,
9. Mat. 16, 27. Reu. 22, 12.
, but also according to the inner and secret pith of the root, from which
proceeds the intent of the worker Matthew. 15, verse. 18. 19. Mark. 7, 21.
. What I purpose when I work; what I think, and wherein I delight, thou
beholdest; thine ears do hear it Psa. 94, 8. 9. 10. 11.
, thine eyes see it 2. Chr. 16. verse. 9. Amos. 9, 8.
, and consider it; thou sealest, markest, notest, and wrightest the same into
thy book Reave. 5, 1. 2, etc.
, be it good or evil, that afterward, when the books shall be opened Reu. 20, 12
, and the dead judged according to the things written in those books, thou
may render for well doing rewards Matt. 25, verse. 34. 35, etc. 46. John. 5,
29. Romans 2, 6. 7. 10. Reu. 22, 14.
, and punishment for wickedness Matt. 25, verse. 41. 42, etc. 46. Reu. 22, 15.
.

Happily this is it, which thou did say by these words, I will see what
their end shall be Deuteronomy. 32, verse. 20.
; and which is spoken of thee on this wise, He tries the perfection of al
things Job. 28, 3.
. For thou doubtless in all that we do, regardest the end of the intent, more
than that which is done.

And when I diligently consider these things, o Lord my God terrible and
mighty Neh. 9, 32 Psalm. 47, 3. Psalm. 96, 4. Daniel. 9, 4.
, I am utterly aghast both through fear and shame, for so much as we have great
need to live well and vprightlie Boethius in his 5. book de Consolat. Prose. 6.
, because we do al things in the presence of that Judge, who sees al things

Show to me, that I may confess my wretchedness to thee. For I said, that I
was rich Reu. 3, 17.
, and had need of nothing; and knew not how that I was wretched, and
miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked.

I supposed my self should be somewhat, when in deed I was nothing. I
professed my self wise Romans 1, 22
, and I became a fool. I thought I was prudent, and I was deceived. For now I
see, it is thy gift Iam. 1, 17.
, without whom we can do nothing John. 15, 5. Philip. 2, 13
. Because if thou Lord keep not the City Psa. 127, 1.
, in vain does he watch, that keeps the same.

Thus have thou taught me, that I might know my self. For thou have forsaken
me, and tried me Psalm. 17, 3. Psalm. 139, 1.
, not for thy own sake, that thou might know me; but for my sake, that I
might know thee.

For as I said, I thought, Lord, I should have bin somewhat of my self; I
thought I had had sufficiency of my self 2, Co. 3, 5.
; and perceived not how it is thou, Lord, which rulest me Psa. 48, 14. Matthew.
2, 6.
, until thou wentest (...) fro me for a space Psa. 71, 12.
, and I took a fall. Then did I see, and perceive, how it was thou which ruled
me; and how I fell of my self, and rose again through thy grace Psa. 37, 23 24.
Prou. 24, 16.
.

O light 1. Ioh. 1, 5. 7.
, thou have opened mine eyes, and raised me up, and lightened me John. 1, 4. 5.
7. 8. 9.
. Now therefore I see, that man's life upon earth is but a tentation Job. 7, 1.
2, etc.
; and that no flesh can glory in thy sight 1. Cor. 1, 29
, nor be justified To. 3, 20. Galat. 2, 16.
. For all goodness, be it little or much, is thy gift Iam. 1, 17.
; and we have nothing of our selves but evil Esai. 64, 6. Genes. 6, 5. Genes.
8, 21


Whereof then may al flesh glory? of wickedness? but that is no glory, but
misery Psalm. 52, 1. Ierem. 9, 23
. May it glory of any good then? and of another goodness? O Lord, goodness is
thine Iam. 1, 17.
, and thine is the glory 1. Chr. 16, verse. 28. 29. Psalm. 29, 1. 2. Esai. 42,
8. Luke. 2, 14.
. For he who seeks of thy goodness his own Ioh. 5, 44. John. 7, 18.
, and not thy glory, (...) a very thief and robber, like the devil himself,
who would have robbed thee of thy glory Esa. 14, 13.


For whosoever would have praise Iere. 9, 23.
of that good thing which is thine, and seeks not therein thy glory, but his
own; yea although he get praise of men Eccl. 11, 2.
for thy gift; yet is he dispraised of thee. Because of thy gift he sought his
glory, and not thine. And he who is praised of men, and dispraised of thee,
neither can be defended by men, when thou shall judge; nor be delivered, when
thou shall condemn.

But, o Lord, who have formed me Esa. 44, 24
from the womb of my mother, suffer me not to fall into that reproach; and never
let it be cast in my teeth that I would have stolen away thy glory.

Al glory be ascribed unto thee Luke 2, 14.
, from whom al goodness does proceed Iam. 1, 17.
, but unto us open shame Dan.9, 7.
, and misery, to whom al evil does belong, unless thou take mercy Wis. 11, 20.
21, etc.

For thou show mercy, o Lord, thou show mercy over al Esai. 54, 7 8.
, and hate nothing which thou have made Wis. 11, 21.
; thou give us of thy good things Job. 1, 21. Job. 5, 8. 9. 10, etc. Psalm.
146, 5. 6. 7, etc. Matthew. 6, 11. Matthew. 7, 7. 8. 9. etc.
; and make us rich, o Lod God, with thy most excele^t benefits. Psa. 113, 5.
6. 7, etc.
. For thou love the poor Psalm. 12, 5.
, and make them rich even with thine own riches Luke 6, 20.
.

O Lord, behold now we are thy poor children, and thy little slocke Luke 12, 32
, open to us thy gates Psa. 78, 23
, that the poor may eat, and be satisfied Psa. 22, 26
; so they which seek thee, will praise thee.

For I know, Lord, and confess through thine instruction, that they alone shall
be enriched Matt. 5, 3. Luke. 6, 20. 21, etc.
who know themselves to be poor, and acknowledge their poverty before thee.
For such as think themselnes rich when they are poor Reu. 3, 17. 18.
, shall be barred from the participation of thy riches.

Wherefore, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
unto thee do I confess my poverty, that all the glory may be thine 1. Chr.
29. verse. 10. 11. 12.
: inasmuch as the good which I have done is thine.

I confess, o Lord, as thou have taught me, I am nothing else but altogether
vanity Psalm. 39, 5. Psalm. 144, 4.
, a shadow of death Psa. 44, 19.
, a dark dungeon, and a barren and empty ground Genesis 1, 2.
, bringing forth nothing without thou bless me, and bearing no fruit but
confusion, sin, and damnation.

If I had any goodness, I received it of thee 1. Cor. 4, 7. James. 1, 17^.
; if I have any at this time, it is thine, or I have it from thee. When I
stood, I stood through thee; but when I fell, I fell through my self; and
always I had stuck in the mire Psa. 69, 14.
, if thou had not plucked me out; I had always bin blind, if you had
not lightened me John. 1, 4, 9.
. When I fell, I had not risen again, unless thou had reached forth thine
hand Psa. 37, 23, 24.
Yea, and when thou had erected me, I had falen by and by, if thou hadest
not held me up Phil. 2, 13.
. And oftentimes I had perished, had thou not governed me Esa. 48, 17.
.

Thus evermore Lord, evermore thy grace and mercy has prevented me Psa. 59,
10.
, delivering me from al evil, saving me from those past, raising me from these
present, and arming me against miseries to come: in like sort cutting away ye
snares of sin before me, and removing al occasions and causes of offense. For
unless thou had done so, I had committed all the sins of the world.

For I am persuaded, o Lord, there has no sin bin committed before time by
man, but another may do the same, if his Creator leave him, by whom he was
made a man Job. 10, 8. 9. 10, etc. Psa. 139, 14. 15. 16. Esaie. 45, 7. 8. 9,
etc.
. But that I did not so, thou have brought it to pass 1. Cor. 4, 7
; that I absteined, thou did command; and that I believed, it was of thy
grace poured upon me Wis. 3, 14. Romans 12, 3. 6.
.

For thou Lord, did guide me both for me and thy self; and thou have given
me grace Iam. 1, 17.
and understanding to abstain both from adultery, and other wickedness.

Chap. 16.
Of the Devil, and of his manifold tentations.
THERE wanted a temptor; but thou were the cause yt he was absent; there wanted
place, and time, and that they should be lacking thou did work. There
wanted neither temptor, nor place, nor time: but thou heldest me back, that I
should not consent. The temptor came, foul and ouglie as he is; but thou did
comfort me, that I might despise him. The temptor came armed and strong Luke
11, 21
, but thou did both encourage me, and bridle him, that he could not
overcome. The temptor came like an Angel of light 2. Cor. 11, verse. 14. 15,
; but that he might not deceive me, thou did take him up; and that I might
know him, thou did open mine eyes.

For he is that great, and red Dracon Reu. 12, 3. 9.
, the old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan, having seven heads, and ten
horns, whom thou have created to play in this great, and wide sea, wherein
are things creeping innumerable Ps. 104, 25
, both small beasts, and great; that is, diverse kinds of Devils, which do
nothing neither day nor night, but range up and down, seeking whom they may
devour 1. Pet. 5, 8.
, if thou preserve not.

For he is that old Dracon Reu. 12, 9.
, which sprang up in the paradise of pleasure Genesis. 3 verse. 1, etc. 13. 14.
, drawing with his tail Reu. 12, 4.
the third part of the Stars of Heaven, and casting them to the earth; which
infecteth the waters of the earth with his poison, that men drinking thereof
may die; he spreads sharp things upon the mire Job. 41, 21.
; and trusts, that he can draw up Jorden into his mouth Job. 40, 18
; he is made without fear Job. 41, 24.
.

And who can save us from being devoured of him! who can pluck us from out his
jaws, but thou only, o Lord, who have broken the heads of that great Dracon
Genesis 3, 15. Reu. 12, 9. 10.
?

O Lord help us Psa. 44, 26 Psalm. 79, 9.
; o Lord spread forth thy wings upon us Psalm. 17, 8.
, that under them we may fly from the face of this Dracon, which pursues us
Reu. 12, 13
; and with thy shield save us from his horns Reu. 12, 3.
. For his continual care, and only desire is, to devour the souls 1. Pet. 5,
8.
, whom thou have created Genesis 1, 26. Psalm. 100, 3. Colos. 3, 10.
.

And therefore unto thee we do cry Iere. 33, 3.
, o Lord our God, deliver us from our daily adversary Mat. 6, 13. Matt. 13,
18. 19. Luke. 11, 4.
, which whether we sleep or wake, or eat, or drink 1. Co. 10, 31
, or whatsoever we do, lies at us night and day 1. Pet. 5, 8.
by all means, by all subtlety and craft Ephe. 6, 10. 11. etc. 2. Tim. 2, 26.
, now openly, now covertly aiming at us with his poisoned arowes to destroy
our souls Eccl. 21, 2.
.

And yet, such is our extreme madness, o Lord, yt albeit we do continualie
behold the Dracon before our eyes with open mouth prepared to devour us Reu.
12, 17.
: yet naietheles we snort 1. These. 5, 6
, and sport in our security, as though we were safe before him, who desires
nothing but our destruction Reu. 12, 12
.

The enemy to murder us, watches always, and sleeps not Mat. 26, 41 Mark.
14, 38
: and we sleep, but watch not 1. These. 5, 6 1. Pet. 5, 8.
for our salvation.

Behold, he has laid infinite traps before our feet 1. Tim. 3, 7.
to take us; and al our ways he has filled with snares to catch our souls
Psalm. 59, 3.
. And who can escape!

He has laid snares in riches, snares in poverty, snares in meat, snares in
drink, in pleasure snares, in sleep snares, and snares in watching; he has
laid snares in our words, snares in our works, and snares in all our ways.

But, o Lord, do thou deliver us from ye snares of the hunter Psa. 91, 3.
, and from the evil word, that we may praise thee, saying:

Blessed be the Lord Ps. 124, 6. 7.
which has not given us a pray unto their teeth. Our soul is escaped even as
a bird out of the snare of the foulers: the snare is broken, and we are
delivered.

Chap. 17.
That God is the light of the righteous.
ANd thou o Lord my light John. 1, 4. 9. John. 12, 46 1. John. 1, 5. 7.
, inlighten mine eyes John. 1, 9. Psalm. 13, 3.
, that I may see light, walk in thy light John. 8, 12. John. 11, 9. 10. John.
12, 35. 36.
, and never stumble upon the snares of Satan.

For who can escape his manifold snares, unless he see them! And who can see
them, except he be enlightened with thy light!

For that father of darkness has hid his snares in his own darkness Ephesians. 6,
11. 12.
, that therein as many as are in darkness may be entangled.

Who are the children of this darkness 1. These. 5, verse. 5.
? Such as see not thy light: in which who so walks, shall not fear Psalm. 91,
5.
. For he that walks in the day, stumbleth not John. 11, 9. 10.
. But if a man walk in the night, he stumbleth, because there is no light in
him.

O Lord, thou art the light John, 1, 4. 9. 1. John. 1, 5. 7.
; thou art the light of the sons of light 1. These. 5, 5
; you art the day which lasts ever, in which thy sons do walk, and stumble
not Ioh. 11, 9.
: without which who so walk, are in darkness, because they have not the light
of ye world John. 8, 12. John. 12, 46
.

Lo, we daily see, that the farther one is estranged from thee the true
light John. 1, 9.
, the more he wrappeth himself in the darkness of sin; and the more he lies
in darkness, the less he sees the snares laid in his way; and so the less
he knows them; and therefore is the oftener carried away, and caught in
them; and yet, which is more horrible than all this, he woteth not that he has
taken a fall. Now he that knows not his ownefal, has so much the less care
to rise again, as he has a greater opinion that he does stand 1 Cor. 10,
verse. 12.
.

But, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1.
the very light of the mind John. 1, 4. 5. 6. 7, etc. 1. John. 1, 5. 7.
, open thou mine eyes at this time, that I may see 1. Ioh. 3, 6.
, and know, least I fall in the presence of mine adversaries.

For our adversary 1. Pet. 5, 8.
laboreth to destroy us: but Lord, we beseech thee, as wax melts before the
fire Psalm. 68, 2.
; so let him perish at our presence.

For, Lord, he is the chief and principal thief, which took counsel, how
to steal away thy glory: but swolen up with pride, and puffed up, he brake
in sunder at the last, and fell upon his own face Esai. 14, 12. 13.
, whom thou flangedst headlong from thine holy mountain, and from the
multitude of thy fiery stones Eze. 28, 14 15, etc.
, in the mids whereof he walked.

Now, o Lord, and God of my life Ecc. 23, 4. Psalm. 42, 8. John. 14, 6.
, since which time that he fell, he has never ceased, to pursue thy children
Reu. 12, 12 17.
.

And for spite of thee, o King most mighty Job. 41, 25 Psalm. 24, 7. 8, etc.
Psalm.74, 12. 13, etc.
, he would destroy this thy creature Reu. 12, 12.
, whom thine almighty goodness has made after thine own image Genesis 1, 26. 27.
Gene. 9, 6. Colo. 3, 10.
, that he may inherit thy glory Matt. 25, verse. 34.
, which he has lost through his own pride Ecc. 10, 14
. But, o our mighty God Esaie 9, 6. Matt. 12, 28 29. Mark. 3, 22. 23, etc.
, bruise him into pieces Reu.12,10
, before he devour us thy silie lambs 1. Pet. 5, 8.
: and lighten our eyes, that we may behold such traps as he has prepared Ephesians.

, and escape from him unto thee, o comfort of Israel Iudit. 15, 9.

And al these things, o Lord, thou know much better than I: thou know
his quareling, and his stiff neck.

Neither do I speak this, to inform thee, who see al things Job.42, 2.
Eccl. 23, 19. 20.
, and beholdest ye most privy thought 1. King. 8, verse. 39. Psalm. 44, 20. 21.
Prou. 24, 12
: but to utter out my complaint against mine enemy 1. Pet. 5, 8. Reu. 12, 12.
before the feet of thy majesty, who art the eternal Judge Psalm. 50, 6. Heb.
12, 23. James. 5, 9.
, that thou may both condemn him Matt. 25, verse. 41.
, and save us thy children. For thou art our strength Exo. 15, 2. Psalm. 18, 2.
Revel. 5, 12.
.

For why, Lord, he is a crafty and subtle enemy, the creekes of his way
cannot easily be descried; neither can the fashion of his countenance 2. Cor.
11, verse. 14. 15.
be known of man, unless thou inlighten.

For he is now here, now there, now a Lamb, now a Wolf, now darkness, by and
by light, and according to the sundry change of things, he offers diverse
tentations to every quality, place, and time.

For to deceive the sad, he makes himself sad; to beguile such as are merry,
he sets on a merry countenance; to entrap those which are spiritual, he turns
himself into an Angel of light 2. Cor. 11, verse. 14. 15.
; to vanquishe the strong, he appears as a lamb; to devour the meek, he
shows himself a Wolf.

And al these things are to be wrought after the similitude of diverse
tentations, that he may terrify some by the fear of the night Psalm. 91, 5. 6.
; some by the arow fleeing in the day; some by the pestilence walking in the
dark, by rushing on, some; and some by the plague at noone day.

Now who is meet, that he may know these things! who can perceive his wiles;
or discover the face of his garment Job. 41, 4. 5.
; or know ye compass of his teeth!

Behold, he has hid his darts in his quiver; and shrouded his snares under ye
show of light 2, Cor. 11, verse. 14. 15.
! And this is the more hardly perceived, unless we receive light from thee, o
Lord our hope Psalm. 91. 9. Iere. 17, 17. Romans 15, 13
, that we may behold al things.

For he hides subtle traps not in the works of the flesh Gal. 5, 19.
only, which with no great ado may be descried; nor in manifest vices only,
but in spiritual exercises besides, under the color of virtues, he cloaketh
vices, and transformeth himself into an Angel of light 2. Cor. 11, verse. 14.
.

These, and many mo things does that son of Belial 2. Co. 6, 15
, even Satan himself 1. Chr. 21, 1 Job. 1, 6. Mark. 3, 23. Revel. 12, 9.
, enterprise against us, o Lord our GOD Psalm. 99, 8. 9. Esai. 37, 20.
. And sometime like a Lion 1. Pet. 5, 8.
, like a Dracon Reu. 12, 3. 4, etc. Reu. 20, 2. 3, etc.
sometime, openly and secretly, inwardly and outwardly, day and night he
lies in wait to catch our souls.

But thou, who do save those which trust in thee Psa.18, 30. Psalm. 22, 4. 5.
, deliver us, o Lord Psalm. 6, 4. Psalm. 17, 13.
, that both he may have sorrow of us, and thou be glorified in us, o Lord our
God Psa. 105, 7

Chap. 18.
Again of Gods manifold benefits.
ANd I the son of thy ha^dmaid Psa. 86, 16 Psalm. 116, 16 Wisd. 9. 5.
who have commended my self into thine hand Psalm. 31, 5. 1. Pet. 4. 19.
in these my poor confessions, will praise thee my redeemer Psalm.18, 2.
with mine whole heart; and call into mind all the good things which thou have
done for me al my life long, even fro my youth Psalm. 71, 5.
.

For I know right well that ingratitude does much displease thee Wisd. 16,
verse. 29.
, as being the root of al spiritual wickedness, and a certain wind drieng,
and burning up al goodness; and stopping the spring of thine heavenly mercy
toward man: whereby dead works now die not; and living die out of hand, and
are no more.

I then will thank thee Romans 1, 8. 1. Cor. 1, 4. Revel. 11, 17
o Lord, that I may not prove ungrateful to thee my deliverer Psalm. 18, 2.
; for thou have delivered me Eccl. 51, 3.
.

How often would that Dracon have devoured me Reu. 12, 3. 4, etc.
! but thou Lord did pluck me out of his mouth. How often have I sinned! and
how often has he bin ready to swalow me up 1. Pet. 5, 8.
! But thou, o Lord my God, have defended me Reu. 12, 7. 8.
.

When I did wickedlie against thee Dan.9, 5.
, and when I brake thy commandementes, then stood he ready to pluck me
down even to hell; but thou did hold him back.

I offended thee, but thou did defend me: I feared not thee, and yet thou
did keep me: I went from thee, and yielded to mine adversary 1. Pet. 5, 8.
; but thou did beat him back, that he durst not take me.

O Lord my God, these benefits have thou conferred upon me, and I wretch
never marked so much. For thus thou have saved me oftentimes from the jaws of
Satan Reu. 12, 7. 8.
, and taken me by force out of the Lions mouth 1. Pet. 5, 8.
, and many ways reduced me from hell, although I wist not how. For I descended
even to the gates of hell; but that I might not go in, thou did hold me
back. I drew very nigh to deaths door Ps. 107, 18.
; but so thou did work, that they could not take me.

In like sort, o my Savior Psalm. 18, 2. Exodus 15, 2. 2. Sam. 22, 2
, thou have delivered me from bodily death; when grievous sickness oppressed
me; when I have bin in many perils both on sea and land, thou have stood by
me, alwaie preserving me from fire, and sword, and from al danger saving me
of thy great mercy 2. Tim. 4, verse. 17. 18.
.

Indeed, Lord, thou did know, that if death then had taken me, my soul
had straightwaie gone into hell, and so had been damned world without end Mat.
25, 41
. But thy grace, and thy mercy did prevent me Psa. 59, 10
, o Lord my God, and saved both my body from death, and my soul from
damnation.

These and many mo benefits thou have bestowed upon me: but I was blind, and
knew not so much, until thou inlightenedst me.

Now therefore, o light of my soul John. 1, 4. 9. John. 8, 12. 1. John. 1, 5.
7.
, o Lord my God Matt. 4, 7. 10. Luke. 4, 8. 12. Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
, my life Ioh. 11, 25. John. 14, 6.
through whom I live Act. 17, 28
; the light of mine eyes John. 1, 9.
through which I see: lo, thou have enlightened me, so that I know thee; for I
live through thee; and therefore I praise thee, and give thee thanks; albeit,
I confess my thanks are vile, and bare, and far unanswerable to thy
benefits, yet such as my frailty can afford. For thou alone art my God 2.
King. 19 verse. 19. Nehem. 9, 6 Psalm. 38, 15. 21. Esai. 37, 16. 17. 20.
, and my merciful creator Genesis 1, 26 27. Psalm. 100, 3. Psalm. 119, 73 Hose. 8,
14.
, loving our souls Wis. 11, 23.
, and hating nothing which thou have made Wis. 11, 21.
.

Lo, I am of sinners, which thou have saved, the chief 1. Tim. 1, 15 16.
, that I might show an example unto others of thy most loving kindness. I will
acknowledge unto thee thy great benefits, for thou have delivered my soul
from the lowest grave Psalm. 86, 13
, both once, and twice, and thrice, and a hundred, yea, a thousand times. I
always inclined down to helwarde, but thou always did bring me back
again; and justly thou might have condemned me a thousand times, if thou
would.

But thou would not; for thou love our souls Wis. 11, 23
and dissemblest the sins of men Wis. 11, 20
because they should amend, o Lord our God of much mercy in all thy ways.

Now therefore, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3. Matthew. 4, 7. 10.
, I see and perceive these things through thy light, and my soul is astonished
in consideration of thy great mercy poured upon me; especialie for delivering
my soul from the lowest grave Ps. 86, 13.
, and for bringing me again to life Psalm. 30, 3.
. I was wholly dead, and thou have wholly revived me again.

Therefore, let it be wholly thine that I live: and wholly I do offer my self
unto thee al whole. Let my whole spirit; my whole heart; my whole body; my
whole life live to thee o my sweet life Ioh. 14, 6. John. 11, 25.
. For thou have redeemed me wholly 1. Co. 1, 30. Heb. 9, 11. 12. 13, etc.
, that thou might possess me whole; thou have renewed me wholly, that thou
might have me wholly again.

Wherefore let me love thee, o Lord my strength 2. Sam. 22 verse 3. Psalm. 18, 2
; let me love thee mine unspeakable joy. Let my whole life henceforth live
not to my self, but to thee 2. Cor. 5, verse. 15.
: my life, I say, which had perished in my misery, had it not bin raised
again in thy mercy, who art a pitiful God Psa 86, 15. Psalm. 103, 8. Psalm.
111, 4. Jonas. 4, 2.
, and a merciful, of much kindness toward thousands of them Exo. 20. 6. Deuteronomy. 5,
10.
which love thy name.

Hence is it, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3. Psalm. 18, 2, 6, etc.
, my sanctifier Eze. 37, verse. 28.
, that in thy law thou have commanded me to love thee with all mine heart Deuteronomy.
6, 5. Mat. 22, 37.
, with all my soul, with all my mind, with all my strength, and with all the
powers which I have, yea, from the very marow and pith of mine heart; and that
every hour, and moment wherein I enioie the goods of thy mercy. For I
should continualie perish, if thou did not guide me continualie; I should
continualie die, did thou not quicken me continualie; and every moment thou
do bind me unto thee, whilst every moment thou bestowest thy great
benefits upon me.

As therefore, there is no hour nor minute in all my life, wherein I enioie not
thy blessing: so ought there be no moment wherein I should not have thee
before mine eyes, and love thee with all the powers both of my body and mind
Deuteronomy. 6, 5.
.

Yet this am I not able to do, without thou give me grace, whose every good
giving, and every perfect gift is Iam. 1, 17.
, and comes down from ye Father of lights, with whom is no variablenes,
neither shadowing by turning.

For it is not in him that wills Romans 9, 16.
, nor in him that runs, but of thee which she west mercy, that we do love
thee. This, Lord, is thy gift, whose every good gift is. Thou command that
we should love thee Deuteronomy. 6, 5.
; grant which thou command, and command what thou will.

Chap. 19.
Of the feruencie of love, or charity.
O Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
, I do love thee, and always more and more I desire too love thee. For thou
art in deed sweeter than any honey Ps. 119, 103
; more nutritive than any milk Salo. so. 4, verse. 10. 11.
; and brighter than ye cleerest light Ecc. 23, 19
. And therefore thou art deerer to me than either gold Ps. 119, 72 127.
or silver, or precious stone Prou. 3, 15.
.

For I despise whatsoever I did in the world in respect of thy sweetenes, and
the glory of thine house, which I have loved Psalm. 26, 8.
.

O fire, which always burnest, and never go out; o love, which always art
inflamed, and never coolest; set me on fire. Let me wholly be inflamed of thee,
that I may love thee wholly.

For he loves thee too little, who loves any thing beside thee Matthew. 30,
verse. 37. John. 12, 25.
, except he love it for thy sake.

O Lord, let me love thee: because thou first did love me 1. Ioh. 4, 19.
.

Where shall I get words to express the signs of thy singular great love
toward me, through thine infinite benefits Ps. 116, 12
, wherewith from the beginning thou have nourished me! Namely, besides the
benefit of creation, when at the beginning thou made me of nothing after
thine own image Genesis 1, 26. 27. Genes. 5, 1. Genes. 9, 6. 1. Cor. 11, 7. Colos.
3, 10.
, in magnifieng and exalting me above al those creatures which thou hadest made
Genesis 1, 26 28. 29.
; and making me glorious with the light of thy countenance, wherwithal thou
have sealed the uppermost seat of mine heart, thereby disseuering me both from
insensible things, and also from brute beasts which have sense, and abasing
me but little beneath Angels Psalm. 8, 3. 4. 5. Hebr. 2. 7.
.

Yet was all this too little before the sight of thy Godhead. For without
cessing thou have fed me with daily, and singular, and most ample benefits;
yea, as if I were thy dear, and weak, and tender child, thou have nourished,
and refreshed me with the teates of thy comfort.

And that I might wholly serve thee Deutr. 10, verse. 20. 21. 22. Psa. 116, 12.
13. 17. 18. 19.
, thou have put al things which thou have made, under my subjection Gen.1, 26
28, etc. Psalm. 8, 6. 7. 8. Eccles. 17, 1. 2. 3. 4, etc.
.

Chap. 20.
That God has made al things to serve for man's use.
THou have made al things to serve man Psalm.8, 6.
, that man alone might serve thee altogether. And that man might be wholly
thine; thou have given him dominion Genesis 1, 26, 28, etc.
over al thy works.

For all outward things thou have created for the body; and the body for the
soul; and the soul for thy self 1. Cor.3, 21 22. 23.
: that man might only serve thee Deuteronomy. 10, verse. 20. Matthew.4, 10.
, and love thee only Deuteronomy. 6, 5. Matt. 22, 37. Mark. 12, 29 30. Luke. 10, 27
, enioieng both thee to his solace, and inferior things for his service Eccl.
17, 1. 2, etc.
.

For nothing under the coape of heaven is for worthiness comparable to the soul
of man, which was created for the chiefest good on high, by enioieng whereof it
might become blessed, to which, if it cleave ouerpassing al earthly things
which are transitory 1. Co. 7, 31 2. Pet. 3, 10. 12. 1. John. 2, 15, 16. 17.
, it cleerelie shall behold the face 1. Co. 13, 12 Revel. 22, 4.
of that eternal immortality 1.Tim. 1, 17
, and the glorious majesty of him whose image it does represent 1. Cor. 11, 7
Colos. 3, 10.
.

Then shall it in the house of the Lord 1 Reu. 21, 23. 24.
enioie those excellent good things, in comparison whereof, al outward
things, which we now see, are as nothing. For they are those things which eye
has not seen Esa. 64, 4. 1. Cor. 2, 9.
, ear has not heard, neither came into man's har^; which God has prepared for
such as love him. O Lord, such things will thou give unto ye soul of man!

And hereby, Lord, which love the souls Wis. 11, 23
, thou day by day do rejoice the souls of thy servants Psalm. 86, 4.
.

But why marvel I at these things, o Lord my God Psalm. 18, 2. 6, etc. Matthew. 4,
7. 10.
! For thou bring unto honor thine own image and similitude, according to
which they were created Genesis 9, 6. Wisd. 2, 23. Eccles. 17. 3. Colos. 3, 10.
.

For to our body, though corruptible Wis. 9, 15. Rom.1, 23.
, and vile 1. Cor. 15. verse. 42. 43. 44.
, that it might see, thou have given the cleerenes of the sky, by the hands of
thine untired servants ye Sun and Moon, which continualie day and night by
thine apointment do service Eccl. 43, 1. 2. 6. 10.
to thy children; that it might breath, thou have given the pure aer; variety
of soundes, that it might hear; sweet odors, that it might smell; qualities of
sauors, that is might taste; grosenes of al bodily things, that it might
feel; to serve his use, thou have given him the beasts of the field Psalm. 8,
6. 7. 8.
; and souls of the aer, and fishes of the sea, and fruit of the earth to
refresh him.

Thou have created medicines of the earth Ecc. 38, 4.
for all diseases, and have prepared for every several evil a several comfort.

For thou Lord art a pitiful God Psa. 86, 15. Joel. 2, 13. Eccle. 2, 12.
and a merciful; thou our maker Esa. 45, 9. Romans 9, 21.

Chap. 21.
That by the consideration of Gods temporal benefits, we may gather the
greatness of his heavenly blessings.
O Lord, reveal thy great mercy toward me; shine upon me yet more and more
with thy light, I beseech thee, that more and more I may perceive the same.

For thy great things by these smalest things Prou. 30, verse. 24. 25, etc.
Esaie. 6, 3. Esaie. 5, 16.
; and thine invisible things, by these visible creatures are seen Romans 1, 20.

, our Lord and maker Deu. 32, 18 Psalm. 100, 3. Eccles. 1, 8.

For if thou prouidest both from heaven, from the aer, from the earth, from the
sea, from light, from darkness, from heat, from shade, from deaw, from rain,
winds, showers, birds, fiishes, beasts, trees, and from the diversity of
herbs, and fruit of the earth, and from the service of al thy creatures which
serve for man's use Psalm. 8, 6. 7.
in their due season, to comfort him withal: If, I say, thou prouidest so
ample, and so infinite benefits for this vile 1. Cor. 15, verse. 42. 43, etc.
, and corruptible Wisd. 9, 15 Romans 1, 23.
body; o Lord, I beseech thee, how excellent, and how innumerable shall those
good things be, which thou have prepared for those which love thee 1. Cor. 2,
9. 10 2. Esdr. 4, 27.
, in that heavenly country Heb. 11, 13 Revel, 21, 1. 2.
, where we shall see thee face to face 1. Cor. 13, verse. 12. Reu. 22, 4.

Great Psa. 92, 5. Psalm. 111, 2.

24. Eccl. 16, 20. 21, etc.
, o Lord King of Heaven 1. Esd. 4, 46 58. Wisd. 18, 15

For since al these things are exceedingly good Genesis 1, 31. Eccle. 39, 16 33.
, and delightful, which thou impartest as well on the evil, as upon the good
Mat. 5, 45. Luke. 6, 35.
: what shall those hereafter be, which are laid up only for the good?

If thy gifts are so infinite and diverse, which in this world thou give to
thine enemies, as well as to thy friends; how great and how infinite, how sweet
and how comfortable shall those blessings be, which thou will impart only
upon thy friends! If we have so much delectation in this time of tears; what
joy will thou bring us on the day of our marriage Mat. 2 2, 1. 2, etc. Luke
14, 16. 17, etc. Revel. 19, 7 9.
! If our prison have such pleasure; how unspeakable shall the happiness of our
country be Heb. 11, 9. 10. 11, etc. 1. Cor. 2, 9.

O God, none eye without thee has seen the things which thou have prepared
for them that love thee 1. Cor. 2, 9.
! for according to the great number of thy mighty works, thy goodness is great
which thou have laid up for them which fear thee Psa. 31, 19.
.

For great art thou, o Lord my God, and incomprehensible Psa. 145, 3
, neither is there end of thy greatness, nor number of thy wisdom Psa. 147, 5
, nor measure of thy benignity: neither is there end, nor number, nor measure
of thy blessings Psa. 106, 2.

art the reward, and the blessing which they shall have that fight as they ought
to do 2. Tim. 2, 5

Chap. 22.
That godly joy takes away al present bitterness of the world.
O Lord God, sanctifier of al thy Saints Ezec. 37, verse. 28.
, these ar thy great benefits wherwithal thou have supplied the want of thine
hungry children.

For thou art the hope of the hopeles Psalm 61, 2. 3. 4.
: the joy of the comfortles 2. Cor. 1, 3. 4.
; the glorious crown of hope 1. Pet. 5, 4.
, prepared for such as overcome Reu. 2, 10.

Thou art the everlasting fulness Reu. 7, 16. 17.
, which shall be given to the hungry Matt. 5, 6. Luke. 6, 21.
. Thou art the endless comfort, which rewardest them that contemn the comfort
of this world for thy perpetual comfort Esai. 65, 13 14, etc. Matthew. 5, 4.
Luke. 6, 21.
. For they who in this world receive comfort, find no comfort in the world to
come Esai. 65, 13 14. Luke. 6, 25.
. But such as are tormented here, be there comforted Esai. 25, 8. Matthew. 5, 4.
Revel. 7, 17. Revel. 21, 4
: And suth as suffer with thee 2. Tim. 2, 12
, do reign with thee.

For no man can have pleasure in both worlds Luke. 16, verse. 25.
; neither can a man rejoice here, and hereafter too; but of necessity he
must forgo the one, which would have the other Esa. 65, 13. 14. Luke. 16, 25
.

When I consider these things, o Lord my comforter 2. Cor. 1, 3
, my soul refuses comfort in this life Psalm. 77, 2.
, that it may be meet for thine endless comfort. For reason it is, that he
should forgo thee, whosoever chooses the comfort of any before thee Luke 14,
26 27. Mat. 16, 24.
.

Wherefore, o sovereign truth John. 14, 6
, I beseech thee, suffer me not to delight in any vain pleasure. But my
request is that al other things may wax bitter to me, and thou alone seem
sweet to my soul; because thou art the vnspeabable sweetness Ps. 119, 103
, by whom al sour things are made sweet.

For thy sweetenes made the very stones of the river sweet to Stephen Acts.
7, 55. 56, etc.

Thy sweetenes made the burning greediron sweet unto Laurence Acts and
Monumentes of the Church persecut. 8. page. 72.

Through thy sweetenes the Apostles departed from the Counsel Acts. 5, 41.
reioicing, that they were counted worthy to suffer rebuke for thy Name.

Andrew went quietly, and ioifulie to the cross Acts and Monumentes of the
Church
, because he hastened unto thy sweetness.

The princes Therefore Peter is not alone the Prince of the Apostles.
of thine Apostles were so filled with this sweetenes, that for desire thereof,
one choase the galowes for his death Eusebius. li. 2, cap. 25.
, and the other cheerfulie offered his head to be struck off with a sword
Euse. in the same book and chap.
.

For to buie the same, Bartholomow gave his own skin Eccles. hist. Cent. 1.
lib. 2. ca. 20. in vita Barthol.
. And to taste this in like sort, John without shrinking back, souped off a
cup of poison.

As soon as Peter had tasted hereof, by and by forgetting al earthly things,
he brake out as if he had bin drunk into these words Mat. 17, 4. Mark. 9, 5.
Luke. 9, 33.
, Master, it is good for us to be here; if thou will, let us make here three
tabernacles, here let us abide still; and enioie thy contemplation, for we
lack nothing now. It suffices us, Lord, that we see thee. It suffices us to
be satisfied with so unspeakable sweetness.

He had tasted but one drop of sweetenes; and lothed forthwith al other
sweetenes. What think ye, he would have said, had he tasted that great
sweetness of thy Godhead, which thou have laid up for such as fear thee Psa.
31, 19.
!

That virgin also, whom we read, went as ioiefulie unto prison, as to a
banquet, had tasted this thine unspeakable sweetness.

This also, as I judge, he had tasted, who said Psa. 31, 19.
, How great is thy goodness, which thou have laid up for them that fear thee!
and who admonished, saying Psa. 34, 8.
, Taste ye, and see how gracious the Lord is.

For this is the happiness, o Lord our God, which we trust thou will give us,
for which co^tinualie we fight under thy baner 2. Tim. 2, 3 2. Cor. 10, 3. 4.

142, 7
to praise thy name, and to rejoice in thy light.

Listen, o Lord, to the cry of the tears Job. 34, 28 Psalm. 10, 11. 12. 13.
of thy poor orphans, that cry unto theee; o our father Matt. 6, 9. 11.
Luke. 11, 2. 3.
, give us this day our daily bread, in the strength whereof we may walk
night and day, and minister the same until we shall approach unto thine holy
mountain Psalm. 3, 4. Psalm. 15, 1. Psalm. 43, 3. Esaie. 57, 13.
. And I the smalest among ye little ones of thy family, when shall I come, and
appear before thy presence Psalm. 42, 2.
, o God my father Math. 6, 9.
, and my strength Psalm. 46, 1.
: that I, who praise thee now for a time, may hereafter praise thee eternalie
Reu. 21, 3. 4.
!

O blessed should I be, were I once admitted to behold thy brightness Ioh. 17,
24. 1. Cor. 13, 12
! who can show me such favor, that thou may permit me to come thereunto!

I know, Lord, I know, and acknowledge that I am unworthy to enter under thy
roof: yet for the honor of thy name, destroy not Psa. 31, 1. 17.
thy servant which puts his trust in thee Psa, 86, 2.
.

And who shall enter into thy sanctuary to consider thy power, unless thou open
unto him? And who can open, if thou shut against him Reave. 3, 7.
? for if thou destroy no man can build again Job. 12, 14.
. And if thou shut man up, none can loase him out. If thou withold ye waters
Job. 12, 15.
, al things will dry up; and if thou send them forth, they will destroy the
earth. If thou bring to nothing al which thou have made, who dare control thee
for the same Job. 11, 10
?

Moreover the goodness of thy mercy, whereby thou did al whatsoever thou
would Psa. 115, 3. Job. 23, 13.
, is everlasting Lam. 3, 22. 23. Psalm. 103, 17 18.
.

O maker of the world 2. Mac. 7, verse. 23. John. 1, 3.
thou have made us Job. 10, 8. Job. 33, 4. Psalm. 119, 73.
, therefore govern us we beseech thee. Thou have created us Psa. 100, 3.
, then despise us not, because we are the work of thine hands Ps. 138, 8.
.

For doubtless, o Lord our God Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
, we silie worms and clay Esai 64, 8.
are unable to enter into the house of thine eternity Esa. 57, 15.
, unless thou, who of nothing have created al things Psalm. 33, 8. 9. Psalm. 148,
1. 2. 5, etc. Revel. 4, 11. Revel. 10, 6.
, do guide us in Ioh. 6, 44.

Chap. 24.
That our salvation comes from God.
ANd I the work of thine hands Psa. 138, 8. Esai. 64, 8.
protest unto thee in thy fear, that I will not trust in my bow Psalm. 44, 6.
; and that not my sword, but thy right hand Psalm. 44, 3.
, and thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, shall save me. Without
which I should despair. But thou who have made me Psa. 100, 3* Psa. 119, 73.
art mine hope Psa. 91. 9.
, for thou forsakest not them Psa. 34, 22.
which trust in thee.

For thou, our Lord God, art gracious Wis. 15, 1.
, long suffering, and gouernest al things by mercy. For although we sin Wis.
15, 2.
yet are we thine: if we sin not, we are thine, for we are in thy count.

For we, all the sort of us, are but a leaf Esai. 64, 6.
; and al men living are but vanity Psalm. 39, 5.
. And our life upon earth Job. 7, 7.
, is but a blast.

Be not angry with us thine Orphans though we fall, for thou know whereof
we be made Psalm. 103, verse. 14.
, o Lord our God Psalm. 8, 1. 9.
.

O God, whose power none can resist Job. 9, 4. 5, etc. Psalm. 76, 1. 2. 3, etc.
Dani. 4, 32.
, will thou show thy strength against a leaf which is carried away with the
wind Job. 13, 25*
, and will thou follow after dry stuble? will thou, o eternal king of Israel
Ioh. 1, 49.
, will thou condemn a dead dog 1 Samuel 24, verse. 15.
? will thou condemn a poor flea?

Lord, we have heard of thy mercy, how thou have not made death Wisd. 1, 13.
; nor have pleasure in the destruction of the living.

For which cause we beseech thee, o Lord, suffer not that which thou have not
made, to have dominion over that creature which thou have made Job. 10, 8. Job.
33, 4. Psalm. 119, 73.
.

For if thou art sorry for our damnation, what does let thee, o Lord, which
can do al things Job. 23, 13. Psalm. 115, 3.
, that thou may not always rejoice for our salvation? If thou will Math. 8,
2. Mark. 1, 40.
, thou can save me, but I, though I would, cannot.

Great is the multitude of the miseries which I am in. For to will is present
with me Romans 7, 18
: but I find no means to perform that which is good.

Will that good is I cannot, unless thou will Phil. 2, 13.
; neither can I do that I would, except thine arm do strengthen me.

Again, sometime I would that I can, should not thy will be done in earth as it
is in heaven Mat. 6, 10. Luke. 11, 2.
? Yet know I not either what I can or would, unless thy wisdom lighten me.
And though I should have will sometime and power with my knowledge, yet were my
wisdom vain Romans 8, 7. 1. Cor. 1, 20.
, and imperfect, unless I were assisted by thy true wisdom.

But al things are at thy pleasure, neither can any resist thy will Romans 9, 19*
, o Lord God of al flesh Ier. 32, 27*
, which do whatsoever thou will both in Heaven, and in Earth, in the Sea, and
in all deep places Psa. 135, 6.
.

Wherefore let thy will be done Matt. 6, 10 Luke. 11, 2.
of us, who call upon thy name Ier. 15, 16.
, least this noble workmanship of thine do perish, which thou have created
for thine own glory Esai. 43, 7. Eccles. 17, 8. 9.
.

And what man lives, and shall not see death Psa. 89, 48.
? shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the grave; without thou deliver
him, which art the lively way of al life Ioh. 14, 6.
, by whom al things do live Act. 17, 28
.

Chap. 25.
That man's will is unapt unto al good works, without the grace of God.
FOr I confessed even now how thou art the stay of my life Psa. 118, 14*
Esaie.12, 2.
, o Lord my God Matt. 4, 7. 8.
, the strength of my salvation Psalm. 18, 1. 2. Psalm. 140, 7.
.

The time was when I trusted in mine own strength, which notwithstanding was
no strength. And so when I would have run, where I thought I stood most sure,
there I took the greatest fall, and came backward, not forward. And what I
thought to atteine, went the farther fro me. Thus triest thou my strength by
many such things.

Now I know thou have enlightened me, for what I thought I could best do, I
found I was least able for to do it of my self. For I said, this I will do, and
that I will bring to pass, but in the end, I could neither do the one, nor the
other. Either I had will, and lacked power Romans 7, 18
, or had power, and lacked will; for I trusted to mine own strength.

But now I confess to thee, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3. Psalm. 18, 1. 2.
, father of heaven and of earth Mat. 11, 25. Luke. 10, 21.
, that in his own strength no man shall be strong 1. Sam. 2, 9
, because the vain presumption of no flesh shall glory in thy sight 1. Cor. 1,
29
.

For it is not in man either to will, that he can do; or to do that he would; or
to know, what he would, or can do: But thou Lord it is which directest the
steps of man Prou. 16, 9.
; of that man, I say which confesses that he is directed of thee Prou. 20,
verse. 24.
, not of himself.

Wherefore, by the bowels of thy mercy Luke 1, 78.
, we beseech thee save Lord what thou have created: for if thou will Mat. 8, 2.
Mark. 1, 40.
thou can save us: and in thy will rests the strength of our salvation Psa.
140, 7.
.

Chap. 26.
The benefits which God has done for us of old.
O Lord, remember thy mercy of old Psalm. 25, 6.
, wherewithal thou have prevented us from the beginning by thy comfortable
blessings.

For before I the son of thine handmaid Wisd. 9, 5.
was borne, o Lord mine hope even fro my mothers breasts Psalm. 22, 9. 10.
, thou did prevent me, preparing a way wherein I should walk Deuteronomy. 4. 1.
2, etc.
, and come unto ye glory of thy house.

Thou knew me before thou did shape me in the belie Ps. 139, 16.
, and before I came out of the womb, thou did preordeine of me whatsoever
pleased thee. What, and how much is written concerning me in thy book lieng
in the secret place of thy consistory, I am utterly ignorant, and therefore
stand mightily in fear; but thou know. For whatsoever I do look for, by
succession of days and times a thousand years hence in this transitory world
1. Cor. 7, 31 1. John. 2, 17.
, is already accomplished in the sight of thine eternity 2. Pet. 3, 8.
; and that which shall be, is already done.

Now then, for so much as I stand in this dark night, ignorant of these things,
fear and trembling are come upon me Psalm. 55, 5.
, while I see many dangers hang over mine head from al sides; many enemies to
hunt after my soul Psalm. 91, 3.
, and an innumerable multitude of miseries to beset me round about in this
mortal life. So that, were not thou present to assist me in these evils, I
should utterly despair. But I have a great confidence in thee, o most gracious
Prince Revel. 1, 5. Reave. 19, 16.
, my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
: and the consideration of the multitude of thy compassions Psalm. 51, 1.
does comfort mine heart. And the former signs of thy goodness, which before I
was borne, prevented me Ps. 139, 13. 14. 15, etc.
, and at this time cheeflie do shine upon me, do assure mine heart of better,
and more perfect blessings to come, which thou reseruest for such as love thee
1. Cor. 2, 9. James.1, 12.
; so that I may rejoice in thee Psa. 32, 11. Ioe l. 2, 23. 1. Cor. 1, 31.
, o Lord my GOD Psalm 7, 1. ^.
, mine holy and lively joy, whereby my youth is comforted.

Chap. 27.
Of Angels appointed for the custody of men.
FOr thou did love me entirely, o my love, before I loved thee 1. Ioh. 4, 19
; thou did create me after thine own image Genesis 1, 26. 27. Eccle. 17, 3.
Colo. 3, 10.
, and advance me above al thy creatures Genesis 1, 28. 29. Psalm. 8, 4. 6, etc.
Eccle. 17, 1. 2, etc.
.

Which dignity I shall then keep, when I know thee, for whom thou have made
me 1. Cor. 3, verse. 23.


Besides thou make thy spirits messengers Psa. 104, 4.
for my sake, to whom thou have given charge over me Psalm. 91, 11. 12. Matthew.
4, 6.
to keep me in all my ways, that I hurt not my foot against a stone.

For these are the watchmen over the walls Esai. 62, 6.
of the city new Jerusalem, and of the mountains about the same, which tend,
and keep watch over thy flock, least he as a Lion make a pray of our souls,
while there is none to deliver; he, I mean that old serpent Reu. 12, 9.
, our adversary the devil, who as a roaring Lion walks about, seeking whom
he may devour 1. Pet. 5, 8.
.

They are the citizens of the blessed citic Jerusalem on high above Gal. 4, 26.
, which is the mother of us al, sent forth to minister for their sakes who
shall be heirs of salvation Heb. 1, 14.
, that they may deliver such from their enemies, and keep them in all their
ways Psa.91, 11
. For they love their fellow citizens by whom they look to have the breach
of their destruction repared.

And therefore with great care and watchfulnes they do stand about us at al
hours, and places, succurring, and providing for our necessities; yea, full
carefulie do they run between us, and thee, o Lord.

For they walk with us in all our ways, they go in and out with us,
diligently considering, how godly, and how honestly we do walk in the
mids of a naughty and crooked generation Phil. 2, 15.
; how earnestly we seek the kingdom of God, and the righteousness thereof Mat.
6, 33
; with what fear and trembling we do serve thee Psalm. 2, 11.
; and how our hearts rejoice in thee, o Lord Zech. 10, 7
.

Those which labor they stre^gthen; those which rest they protect; such as
fight they encourage; they crown such as overcome; they rejoice with such as
rejoice To. 12, 15.
, such I mean as rejoice in thee Phil. 4, 4.
; and they suffer with such as suffer, I say, with such as suffer for thy name
sake 1. Pet. 2, 19. 20. 1. Pet. 4, 14. 15.
. Great is the care which they have of us! Great is the affection of their love
toward us!

And all this for ye honor of thine inestimable goodwil wherewith thou have loved
us. For they love those whom thou do love; they keep those whom thou do
keep; they forsake those whom thou do forsake; neither can they abide such
as work iniquity; because thou also hate al them that work iniquity Psalm.
5, 5* 6.
, and wilt destroy them that speak lies.

When we do well, the Angels rejoice, but the devils are sad: when we do il,
the devils rejoice; but the Angels are sad. For there is joy among the Angels
for a sinner y^ conuerteth Luke 15, 7. 10.
: and joy to the devil for a just man that forsakes repentance.

Grant therefore, o father Math. 6, 9. Luke. 11, 2. Romans 8, 15. Galath. 4, 6.
, that they may always rejoice over us, that both thou always may be
glorified in us, and we may be brought with them into thy fold Ioh. 10, 16.
, that together we may praise thy Name, o Creator both of men Job. 10, 8. Job.
33, 4. Psalm. 100, 3. Psalm. 119, 73.
, and Angels Ps. 148, 1. 2, etc. 5.
.

These things I confess before thy Majesty, praising thee for them. For great
are these thy benefits which thou have honored us withal, in giving us thy
spirits Psa. 104, 4. Heb. 1, 7.
to be messengers for our service.

For thou had given whatsoever is contained under ye coape of heaven Genesis 1,
28. 29. Psalm. 8, 4. 6, etc.
, yet thoughtest thou all that too little, unless withal thou addest those things
which are above heaven.

For this benefit, praise ye Lord, al ye his Angels Ps. 103. 20 Psalm. 148, 2.
; praise him al ye his works Ps. 103, 22.
; yea, let al thy Saints bless thee Ps. 145, 10.
;

O our glory Judith. 15, verse. 9.
thou have exceedingly honored; enriched; and glorified us with manifold
benefits Ps. 139, 17* 18.
.

O Lord, how excellent is thy Name in all the world Psalm. 8, 1.
! For what is man, y^ thou art mindful of him Psalm. 8, 4. Job. 7, 17.
, and the son of man, that thou visitest him! For thou the ancient truth have
said Pro. 8, 31.
, My delight is with ye children of men.

Is not man rottennes, and the son of man a worm Job. 25, 6.
? Is not every man living mere vanity Psa. 39, 5. Psalm. 144, 4.
? yet thou think it good to open thine eyes upon such Job. 14, 3.
, and causest him to enter into judgment with thee.

Chap. 28.
Of Gods bottomless predestination, and foreknowledge.
TEach me, o bottomless deep Ecc. 24, 33*
, o wisdom which have made al things Pro. 8, 27. 28, etc. Eccle. 24, 6.
, and weighed the mountains in a weight Esai. 40, 12
, and hanged the mass of the earth by three fingers in a balance.

Lift up the mass of this body Wis. 9, 15
which I carry about, by thy three invisible fingers unto thy self, that I
may see and know how excellent thou art in all the world Psalm. 8, 1. Job. 7, 17.
.

O most ancient light, which did shine before al light in the holy
mountains of thine old eternity, to which al things before they were made,
were naked and open Heb. 4, 13*
! O light, which can abide no spots, inasmuch as thou art without spot Hab.
1, 13.
, and most pure! what delight can thou take with man Prou. 8, 31
! what communion has light with darkness 2. Cor. 6,14
! where is thy delight in man? In what part of me have thou prepared a meet
sanctuary for thy sacred Majesty, wherinto when thou go, thou may
delight thee to thy contentment? For meet is it that thou should have a
pure parlor, who art the purifieng virtue Psa. 19, 12. Psalm. 51, 2. 7. Titus.
2, 14.
, who can not be seen, much less possessed, but of the pure in heart Matthew.
5, 8* Psalm. 24, 3. 4.
.

But where is there so pure a temple in man 1. Co. 3, 16 1. Cor 6, 19. 2. Cor.
6, 16.
, that it may receive thee which rulest the world 2. Mac. 7,9
! who can bring a clean thing out of filthiness Job. 14, 4.
! But thou alone, who only art pure.

For who can be cleansed by the unclean Ecc. 34, 4.
? For according to the law which thou gave to our fathers in the mount out of
the mids of fire Deu. 5, 22 23. 24.
, and in the cloud covering the darksome water, Whatsoever touches an
unclean thing shall be unclean Leu. 22, 4. 5. 6. Nom. 19, 22
.

But al of us are as the cloth of a menstruous woman Esai. 64, 6.
, we proceed out of a corrupt and filthy mass; and bear in our foreheds the
spot of our uncleanness, the which we cannot hide especialie from thine eyes, who
see al things Ecc. 23, 19. Psalm. 94, 7. 8. 9.
.

So then we cannot be clean, unless thou make us clean Psalm. 51, 2. 7. Tit. 2,
14.
, who only art clean Reave. 4, 8. Revel. 15, 4.
.

And of us the sons of men those only thou make clean, in whom it has
pleased thee to make thine abode Romans 8, 9. 2. Tim. 1, 14.
, whom by the bottomless and secret depth of the incomprehensible judgments
of thy wisdom, which are always just, though they be secret, thou have
without any merits of theirs predestined before al world Ephesians. 1, 4.
; called To. 8, 30.
out of the world Ioh. 17, 6.
; justified To. 8, 30.
in the world; and after the world thou will glorify them.

Yet do y^ not this to al men, which makes the wise of this world Luke 10, 21
even to wonder, and to be astonished. And I also, Lord, when I think hereof,
am utterly aghast and amazed at the deepenes of the riches To. 11, 33.
both of thy wisdom, and knowledge. How unsearchable are ye judgments of thy
righteonsnes! thy knowledge is above my reach. For of the same claie thou have
made some vessels unto honor Romans 9, 21.
, and some to everlasting infamy.

Therefore whom out of many thou have taken Ezec. 36, verse. 24.
into an holy temple for thy self, those thou do cleanse, pouring upon them
clean water Ezec. 36, verse. 25.
, whose names and number is known to thee Psa 69, 28, Philip. 4, 3.
, which alone countest the number of the stars Ps. 147, 4.
, and call them al by their names; who also be written in the book of life
Luke 10, 20 Revel. 3, 5. Reave. 20, 12. Reu. 21, 27.
; who cannot perish Ioh. 10, 27 28.
; to whom al things work together for the best To. 8, 28.
, yea very wickedness it self. For when they fall, they be not bruised into
pieces: for thou put under thine hand Psa. 37, 24
, thou will keep al their bones Ps. 34, 20.
, so that not one of them shall be broken.

But a most vile death have the wicked, they I say, whom in the great deep
of thy secret judgments Psalm. 36, 6.
, which are always righteous, thou did foreknowe, even before thou did
make either the heaven, or the earth, should everlastingly be damned, the
number of whose names and naughty merits thou know, who have counted the
number of the sand of the sea Eccle. 1, 2. 9.
; and sounded the very bottom of the deep, whom thou have given up to their
uncleanness Romans 1, 24
, to whom al things work together for ye worst, yea even their prayer is
abomination Prou. 28, 9
; so that albe they should ascend up to the very heavens Obad. 1, 4.
, and lift their head above the clouds, and make their nest among the stars;
yet shall they be cast away in the end like doong.

Chap. 29.
Of such as once were godly, and afterward proved wicked; and contrariwise.
GReat are these thy judgments, o Lord God, o judge righteous Psa. 67, 4. Tob.
3, 2.
and strong, which iudgest right Psalm. 9, 4.
, and do things that are unsearchable Job. 5, 9. Job. 37, 5. 6, etc.
and deep: the which when I consider al my bones do shake.

For there is not a man upon earth sure, that we can serve thee godly and
purelie in fear Psalm. 2, 11.
, and rejoice before thee in trembling all the days of our life: that there
should be neither service without fear, nor joy without trembling; and that
he which has girded his harness may not boast himself 1. Ki. 20, 11.
as he that has laid it off; neither in deed that any flesh should rejoice
in thy presence 1. Cor. 1, verse. 29.
but shake and tremble before thee Psa. 2, 11.
; inasmuch as no man knows whether he be worthy love or hatred Eccle. 9, 1.
, al things being kept uncertain til the time to come.

For, Lord, we have not only heard our fathers tell, but have seen also with
our eyes, which thing I cannot utter without trembling, nor confess without
fear, how many hertofore have climed in manner up unto heaven Amos. 9, 2.
, and made their nest among the stars Obad. 1, 4.
, which afterward fell down headlong even to hell 2. Pet. 2, 4. Jude. ver. 6.
, and were hardened in wickedness.

We have seen the stars fall from heaven through the violent stroke of ye
Dracons tail Reu. 12, 4.
. And we have seen some lieng in the dust of the earth Psa. 113, 5. 6. 7. 1.
Sam. 2, 6. 7. 8. Luke. 1, 46. 47. 48, etc.
, who suddenly by thine helping hand, o Lord, have woonderfulie ascended.

We have seen the living, dieng; and the dead, rising from death: we also have
seen them which walked among the sons of God, in the mids of stones of fire
Eze. 28, 14* 16.
, even as claie to have vanished to nothing.

We have seen light become darkness; and darkness come out of light: because
publicans and harlots do go before the inhabiters into the kingdom of God
Mat. 21, 31
; and the children of the kingdom Mat. 8, 12.
are cast into utter darkness.

And how comes all this to pass, but even because they mounted up unto that
hill, wherinto the first ascended an Angel Esai. 14, 12
, and came down a devil.

But, Lord, whom thou have predestinate, them thou have called Romans 8, 30
, and sanctified, and cleansed, that they may be a meet dwelling place 1. Co.
3, 16. 1. Cor. 6, 19.
for thy majesty, with whom and in whom thy holy and pure delight is Pro. 8,
31.
, in whom thou take pleasure, and reioicest their youth, dwelling with them
2. Co. 6, 16
in their remembrance, that they may be thine holy temple 1. Co. 3, 16
: which doubtless is no small commendation of our humanity.

Chap. 30.
That the soul of a faithful man is the sanctuary of God.
FOr the soul, which thou have created Genesis 1, 26. 27. Colo. 3, 10.
, not of thy self, but by thy word John. 1, 3.
; not of the matter of any element, but of nothing; the which is reasonable,
of understanding, spiritual, living always, and ever moving, which thou have
sealed with the light of thy countenance, and hallowed by the virtue of thy
baptism, is made so capable of thy glory, that thou alone, and nothing else
can satisfy the same Psalm. 42, 1* 2.


And when it has thee, it has her hearts desire; neither is there any
outward thing beside, which it would wish. But while it desires any outward
thing, it is a manifest argument, that thou art not within. For if thou be had,
it can wish for no more Reu. 7, 17. Revel. 21, 4.
.

For inasmuch as thou art the sovereign Iam. 1, 17.
, yea all that good is; it has nothing which it may wish for more, but enioieth
thee, who art all that good is.

Now if it covet not after all that good is, it rests that it must covet after
some thing, which is not all that good is; and so consequently not the
sovereign good; and so not God, but rather a creature.

And as long as it desires a creature, it is always hungry. For although it
have what it can desire of creatures; yet remains it empty. For there is
nothing which can fulfill it, but thou alone Psalm. 42, 1. 2.
, after whose image it was created Genesis 1, 26. 27. Wisd. 2, 23. Eccles. 17, 1.
2. 3.
.

And those thou fillest, which desire nothing beside thee; and make them
meet for thee, holy Psa. 31, 23 Phil. 4, 22.

, undefiled Ephesians. 1, 4.
, and the friends of God Esai. 41, 8. Wisd. 7, 27. John. 15, 14. 15.
, which do judge al things but as doong Phil. 3, 8.
that they may win thee alone.

For this is the blessing which thou have bestowed upon man; this is the honor
wherewith thou have exalted him among al, yea, and above al creatures Psalm. 8,
1. 3, etc.
, that thy name may be woonderful throughout all the world.

Behold, o Lord my God Psalm. 18, 2 6.
, who art most hie Dan. 7, 27 1.Esdr. 6, 31. Hebr. 7, 1.
, most righteous Mat. 19, 16 17. Mark. 10. 17 18.
, almighty Dan. 7, 27. 2. Cor. 6, 18. Revel. 4, 8.
, now have I found the place where thou inhabitest, it is even the soul which
thou have created after thine own image and similitude Genesis 5, 1. Colos.3, 10.
, which does seek and long after thee alone: not the soul which neither
seeks nor desires thee.

Chap. 31.
That God neither by the outward nor inward senses can be found out.
I Have gone astraie like a lost sheep Ps. 119, 176
, seeking thee without, who art within. And much have I labored to find thee
without me, and thou dwell within me Romans 8, 9.
at leastwise if I had a lust to thee.

I went about by the lanes, and by the streets Sal. songs. 3, verse. 2.
of the city of this world, seeking thee, but I found thee not. Because I
sought thee not rightly without, who art within.

I sent abroad my messengers, namely al mine outward senses, to seek thee;
yet did I not find thee; because I sought amiss.

For now do I see, o my light Esai. 60, 19 Micah. 7, 8.
, o God, which have enlightened me John. 1, 9.
, I see now that I did not well in seeking thee by them. For thou art within,
yet could they not tell me, where thou came in Job. 9, 11.
.

For mine eyes do tell me; If he had no color, he entered not by us: Mine ears
do tell me; If he made no noise, he passed not by us: My nose tells me, If he
had no sent, he came not by me: My tasting says, if he had no savor, he
entered not by me; likewise my feeling does say, If he had no body, ask not
me the question.

Therefore, o my God, these things are not in thee. For it is neither the
fairenes of body, nor the beutie of time, nor the brightness of light, nor ye
freshnes of color, nor the melody of music, nor any thing else which is
pleasant to the ear; it is neither ye fragancie of flowers, nor the smell of
ointments or spices, nor the sweetenes of honey or manna, delightful to the
taste; neither is it those things which are louelic to be touched, or embraced;
nor finalie any thing subject to these senses which I seek, when I seek my
God. Be it far fro my thought, that I should think these things to be my God,
which are comprehended of the senses even of brutish creatures.

And yet when I seek my God, I seek for all that a certain light excelling al
light, which the eye cannot comprehend 1. Cor. 2, 9.
; a certain sound excelling al sound, which the ear can not conceive; a
certain sent, surpassing al sent, which the nose cannot discern; a certain
sweetenes, excelling al sweetenes, which no taste can judge of; and a certain
embracement, above al embracement, which no feeling can reach unto.

For this light shines, where no place is to contain it; This voice sounds,
where no aer is to carry it; this sent gives a sent, where no wind is to waste
it; this savor sauoreth, where no taste is to eat it; and this embracing is
felt, where it is not sundered. This is my God, and there shall none other be
compared unto him Baru. 3, 35
. This do I seek, when I seek my God; This do I love, when I love my God.

Too late have I loved thee, o beutie so old and yet so fresh, too late have I
loved thee! Thou were within, and I was without, where I sought thee; and I
deformed, as I am, rushed upon these goodly things Genesis 1, 31. Eccle. 39, 16.
33.
, which thou have made Genesis 1, 1. 2. 3, etc. Psalm. 148, 1. 2, etc. Eccle. 18, 1.
.

Thou were with me, but I was from thee. Those things kept me aloof from thee,
which could not be but in thee Act. 17, 25. 28.
.

I went al about seeking thee, and forsaking my self for all things.

I asked the earth if it were my God; and it answered, No: and al things in the
earth confessed the same.

I asked the sea, and the deepes, and al things creeping in them; but they
answered, We are not thy God, seek him above us.

I asked the puffing aer, and the whole aer with all the dwellers in the same
made me this answer; Anaximenes is deceived Anaximenes was of opinion that the
aer was God; as Augustine here, and Theodor. in his book de Principijs* does
record.
: for I am not thy God.

I asked the heaven, the sun, the moon, and the stars: and they said,
Neither be we thy God.

Then said I unto al those which stand about the doors of my flesh; Tell me, I
pray you, what think ye of my God? tell me somewhat of him? and they al
answered with a loud voice, He has made us Psa. 100, 3
.

Then said I to the mass of the whole world, Tell me, art thou my God, or no?
And it answered with a mighty voice, I am not; but through him I am whom thou
seek in me; He has made me John. 1, 3. 10. Heb. 11, 3.
; seek him above me, by whom I am now ruled 2. Ma. 7, 9.
, and was once created.

The asking of the creatures is the deep consideration of them: their answer,
is the testimonic which they yield of God. For all things cry, God has made us
Genesis 1, 1. 2. 3, etc. Psalm. 136, 1. 5. 6, etc. Eccl. 18, 1. Acts. 14, 15.
Act. 17, 24.
.

For, as the Apostle says Romans 1, verse. 20.
, the invisible things of God, are seen by the creation of the world, being
considered in his works.

Then I returned unto my self, and went into my self, and said thus to my
self, what art thou? I answered my self, and said, A man reasonable Genesis 1,
27. Genesis 5, 1.
, and mortal Wisd. 7, 1. 2. Esd. 7, 14. 15. Act. 14, 15.
. Then began I to discuss what that should be, and said: Whence is this kind
of creature, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
? whence but of thee? Thou have made me Psa. 100, 3
, and not I my self.

What art thou? Thou I mean by whom I live Act. 17, 28
, naie thou by whom al things do live Ps. 145, 15. Act. 17, 25.
, what art thou? Verily, thou, Lord my God Psalm. 18, 2. 6. Matthew. 4, 7. 10.

; the beginning and the end of al things Reave. 1, 8.
; who art before the world Ecc. 24, 12
, and from everlasting to everlasting Ecc. 42, 21
.

Thou art my God Deu. 6, 13. 16.
, and the Lord of al which thou have created 2. Ma. 7, 9.
, with thee are the causes of al stable things, with thee do the originals of
al changeable things abide unchangeable; and with thee do the grounds of
reasonable, unreasonable, and temporal things continue for ever.

O my God, tell me thine humble servant, o merciful God tell thy servant, even by
thy great mercies, I beseech thee, tell me, whence is this kind of creature if
not of thee? Shall any man be his own maker Psa. 100, 3.
? Have any either being, or life, but from thee Act. 17, 25* 28.
? Art not thou the principal being, from whom al being does proceed Iam. 1, 17.
? For whatsoever is, it is of thee, because without thee there is nothing.

Art not thou the welspring of life Psalm. 36, 9. John. 4, 14.
, from which flows al life? For whatsoever lives, does live through thee
Act. 17, 28
: because without thee nothing does live. Therefore, o Lord, thou have made al
things.

What? shall I ask who has made me? Thou, Lord, have made me Psa. 100, 3.
Psalm. 119, 73
, without whom nothing was made John. 1, 3.
. Thou art my maker, and I thy workmanship Psa. 139, 13* 14, etc. Wisd. 2, 23.
.

Thanks be to thee, o Lord my God, through whom I live, and through whom al
things do live, because thou have made al. Thanks be to thee, o my maker: for
thine hands have made me, and facioned me Job. 10, 8. Psa. 119, 73.
. Thanks be to thee, o my light John. 1, 4. 9. John. 8, 12. 1. John. 1, 5. 7.
; because thou have enlightened me; whereby I have found both thee and my self.
Where I found my self, there I knew my self; where I found thee, there I
knew thee; and where I knew thee, there thou did inlighten me. Thanks be to
thee, o my light, for inlightening me. But what is it that I said, I knew
thee? Art not thou a God incomprehensible Job. 23, 8. 9.
, unmeasurable Psa. 139, 7* 8. 9.
the King of kings 1. Tim. 6, verse. 15. Reu. 17, 14. Reu. 19, 16.
, and Lord of lords, who alone have immortality 1. Tim. 1, 17
, and dwell in the light that none can attain unto 1. Tim. 6, 16
, whom never man saw, neither can see? Art not thou an hidden God, whose glory
is past finding out; art not thou best known, and a wonderful beholder of thy
self?

Who then knows that which he never saw? For thou have said in thy truth, No
man shall see me and live Exodus 33, verse. 20.
: Thy Prophet has said through thy truth, No man has seen God at any time
John. 1, 18.
. Who then knows that, which he never saw? And thy truth it self John. 14, 6
has said, No man knows the Son but the Father Mat. 11, 27.
: neither knows any man the Father but the Son. Thy Trinity alone, which
is above al knowledge, is perfectly known only to it self.

Then what is it, that I, a man like to vanity Psa. 144, 4
, have said, I know thee? For who knows thee, but thy self alone?

For thou, God alone, in thy most holy, and heavenly word art said to be
almighty Genesis 35, 11 Eccles. 43, 1. 2. 3, etc. Reave. 4, 8.
, passing praise worthy Psalm. 96, 4. Psalm. 145, 3.
, passing glorious, passing honorable, passing hie Genesis 14, 18 Luke. 1, 32. 35.
, beyond al being. For thou art found superessentialie, and beyond al knowledge
to be above the nature of any thing which may be imagined, be it intellectual
or sensible, and above every name that is named Ephesians. 1, 21.
, not in this world only, but also in that which is to come: Inasmuch as
through the superessential, and secret power of thy Godhead, (how no reason,
understanding, nor being can conceive) thou dwell so as no man can either
search thee out, or have access unto thee, and that in thy self, where as
light is, that none can attain unto 2. Tim. 6, verse. 16.
, and brightness which no creature can either find out, comprehend, or utter,
whereunto no light can attain. Because it is no light to be looked upon, or
seen, but is thought to be a light exceeding both the reach of reason, and of
understanding, and is more than can be attained unto, more than unchangeable,
more than may becommunicated with any: Such a light it is, as never Angel,
nor man saw, neither can see 1. Tim. 6. verse. 16.
.

This is thy heaven, Lord, thine hiding heaven, thy passing secret heaven, I
mean thy light beyond al understanding Phil. 4, 7.
, beyond al reason, beyond being: of which it is said, The heaven of heaven is
the Lords. The heaven of heaven, in comparison whereof al other heaven is but
earth: for so much as it is passing marvel ouslie heaued up above al heaven. Yea
such an heaven, as that fiery heaven compared thereunto, is but as earth. For
this is the Lords heaven of heaven: because none knows it, but the Lord alone.

Unto this heaven no man ascends, but he which has descended from heaven
John. 3, 13*
. For no man knows the Father but the Son Mat. 11, 27
, and the Spirit of them both Ioh. 15, 26
: neither knows any man the Son, but the Father Mat. 11, 27
, and the Spirit of them both Ioh. 15, 26*
.

O sacred Trinity, o Trinity eternal, passing glorious, passing utterance,
passing finding out, which no man can attain unto 1. Tim. 6, verse. 16.
, no man comprehend Job. 23, 8. 9.
, no man conceive, as being beyond al being, and superessentialie passing al
sense, al reason, al understanding, al knowledge, al essence of supercelestial
spirits; the which nothing, no not the very Angels can either utter, or
conceive 1. Cor. 2, 9
; or venderstand, or know: thou perfectly art known 1. Cor. 13, verse. 12.
to thy self, o Trinity.

How then do I know thee, o Lord God most hie Psa. 50, 14* Luke. 1, 32. Luke.
8, 28.
, above al earth, and above al heaven, whom neither Cherubins, nor Seraphins
perfectly do know; but with the wings of their contemplations they cover his
face Esaie. 6, 1. 2.
which sits upon the hie and stately throne, saying Esai. 6, 3.
, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God of hosts, the whole world is full of thy glory!

The Prophet was astonished, and said, Woe is me, I know not what to say,
because I am a man of polluted lips Esaie. 6, 5.
! And my heart was astonished, and said likewise, Woe is me for speaking because
I am a man of polluted lips. Yet I said, I knew thee.

Notwithstanding, woe to them, Lord, who are tong-tied when they should speak
of thee. For they which babble much Matthew. 6, 7
are made mute without thee.

And I, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
, will not be still: because thou have made me Genesis 1, 26. 27. Psalm. 100, 3.
Psa. 119, 73.
, and lightened me John. 1, 9.
, and found me. So that I know thee John. 17, 3
, because thou have enlightened me John. 1, 4. 9.
.

But how do I know thee? Doubtless I know thee in thy self. I know thee
not as thou art to thy self 1. Cor. 13, verse. 12.
, but as thou art to me; yet not without thee, but in thy self. For thou art
the light which have enlightened me John. 1, 9. 1. John. 1, 5. 7.
.

For as you art to thy self, thou art known to thy self alone 1. Cor. 13,
verse. 12. John. 1, 18. 1. Tim. 6, 16 1. John. 4, 12
: but as thou art to me, according to thy grace, thou art known to me.

But what art thou to me? o merciful God Exo. 34, 6* Psalm. 86, 5.
, tell me thy miserable servant, for thy mercies sake, tell me what thou art to
me ward. Say unto my soul Psalm. 35, 3
, I am thy salvation; hide not thy face away fro me, o Lord, least I die.

Suffer me to speak with thy mercy, me I say, earth and ashes Genesis 18,
verse. 27. Job. 30, 19. Eccle. 17, 33
; suffer me to speak with thy mercy. For great is thy mercy toward me Psa.
117, 2
.

I will speak unto my God, albeit I am but dust and ashes Genesis 18, verse. 27.
.

Tell me thy humble servant, o merciful God Exo. 34, 6.
tell me thy miserable servant, for thy mercies sake tell me what art thou to me
ward?

Thou also did thunder from heaven Psa. 18, 13
with a mighty voice into the inner ear of mine heart; thou brakedst my
deafenes, so that I heard thy voice; thou did inlighten my blindness, and I
saw thy light; and knew, how y^ thou art my God Psalm. 16, 2.
. Therefore did I say, I knew thee, because I knew that thou art my God. I
knew thee to be the only very God Ioh. 17, 3.
, and whom thou have sent, Jesus Christ.

The time was, when I knew thee not. But woe worth that time, when I did not
know thee; woe worth that blindness, when I did not see thee; woe worth that
deafenes, when I did not hear thee. Then blind, deaf, and ouglie as I was, I
rusht upon those fair things which thou have made.

Yet even then thou were with me, but I was not with thee; and those kept me
far off from thee, which should not have been without thee.

Thou have enlightened me, o light of the world John. 1, 4. 9. John. 8, 12.
, so that I have seen thee, and loved thee. For no man does love thee but he
sees thee: And no man does see thee, but he which loves thee.

It was late before I loved thee, o beauty so ancient, and yet so fresh; late
was it before I loved thee. But woe worth that time when I loved thee not.

man; confessing God to be thy Father 2. Cor. 1, 3. 2. Cor. 11, 31. Ephesians. 3, 14.

according to their deeds Romans 14, 10* 2. Cor. 5, 10.

every one is worthy, rest or torment.

For all men, even as many as have received souls in their humane flesh which
they had in this world, shall rise at that day through the sound 1. Cor. 15,

Which also even from the beginning have instructed with the gift of thy grace

that they might declare abroad the woonderful mysteries of the kingdom of
God; who also together with the Father and the Son, of all the Saints of God,
art worshipped and glorified. Among whom I the son of thine handmaid Psa.

thee o my light Mich. 7, 8

For in thee, o Lord, al my bones rejoice, saying, O Lord, who is like to thee?
Among the gods who is like to thee Exo. 15, 11.
? Not that whom the hands of men have made; but thou who have made the hands
of men.

The idols of the nations are silver and gold Psa. 115, 4.
, even the works of men's hands: so is not he which made man. All the gods of
the people are idols Psalm. 96, 5.

Chap. 33.
A confession of man's wretchedness.
WHo is like unto thee o Lord, among the gods Exo. 15, 11.
! who is like unto thee, so glorious in holiness, fearful in praises, doing
wonders!

Long was it ere I knew thee, o true light John. 1, 4. 9. John. 8, 12.
, long was it ere I knew thee.

There was a great and dark cloud before my vane eyes: so that I could not
behold the sun of righteousness, nor the light of the truth.

I, a child of darkness 1. These. 5, 5*
, was wrapped in darkness, I loved darkness, because I knew not the light. Blind
I was, and I loved blindness: after darkness I followed through darkness.

Who brought me thence, where I a blind wretch, sat in darkness, and in the
shadow of death Luke 1, 79.
? Who took me by the hand, to lead me out? What was he which enlightened me?
I sought him not, yet sought he me out: I called him not, but he called me.
What was he? Even thou it was, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
, pitiful and merciful Psa. 86, 15.
, even thou Father of mercies 2. Cor. 1, 3.
, and God of al comfort. Even thou it was, my Lord GOD most holy Reu. 16, 5.
Revel. 4, 8.
, whom I confess with all mine heart, praising thy Name.

I sought not thee, yet thou soughtest me; I called not upon thee, but thou
calledst me. For thou have called me by thine own Name. With a mighty voice
thou have thundered Psa. 18, 13.
from above into the inward ear of mine heart, saying, Let there be light Gene.
1, 3.
, and light was made: insomuch as ye great cloud vanished away, and the dark
mist which had covered mine eyes melted, whereby I saw thy light, and knew
thy voice, and said:

Of a truth, Lord, thou art my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3. Math. 4, 10.
, which brought me out of darkness Luke 1, 79.
, and from the shadow of death, and have called me into thy woonderful light,
so that now I see, thanks to thee mine inlightener therefore.

And I looked back, and saw the darkness wherein I had been, and the dark
dungeon, wherein I had lien, whereat I trembled, was afraid, and uttered these
words:

Woe, woe worth the darkness wherein I lay; woe, woe to that blindness in which I
could not see the light of heaven; woe, I say, woe to mine old ignorance, when I
knew not thee, o Lord.

I thank thee, o mine inlightener John. 1, 9.
, o my Savior Luke 1, 31. 69. Luke. 2, 11. 31.
I thank thee for inlightening me, whereby I know thee.

Late it was ere I knew thee, o ancient truth Ioh. 14, 6.
, late it was ere I knew thee, o eternal truth. Thou were in the light, and I
was in darkness: I knew thee not, because I could not be enlightened, but by
thee John. 1, 9.
; and without thee there is no light.

Chap. 34.
A consideration of Gods Majesty.
O God most holy Leu. 11, 44. 45. Psalm. 99, 9. Revel. 4, 8. Revel. 16, 5.
, of inestimable majesty, God of gods Deu. 10, 17
, and Lord of lords, who art most wonderful Ecc. 43, 29. 30.
, and can neither be conceived in thought, nor expressed by word Ecc. 43, 30
31.
; of whom all the Angels in heaven do stand in fear; whom all the dominations
and thrones do adore Reave. 5, 11. 12. 13.
, and at whose presence al powers do shake; whose might and wisdom is
infinite; which upon nothing have laid the foundation of the earth Zech. 12, 1.
Hebr. 1, 2. 10.
, and gathered the waters of the sea together Psa. 33, 7. Psalm. 78, 13.
in the aer as in a botle.

O Lord most mighty 2. Co. 6, 18 Revel. 4, 8. Revel. 7, 17. Revel. 15, 3.
, most holy Leu. 11, 44 45. Revel. 4, 8.
, most puissant 1. Sam. 2, 2 8. Psalm. 24, 8. Prou. 18, 10.
, God of al flesh Ier. 32, 27.
, at whose presence heaven and earth do fly Ps. 104, 7. 8.
, and at whose beck all the elements do obeie; let al thy creatures worship and
praise thee Ps. 148, 1. 2, etc.
.

And I the son of thine handmaid Ps. 116, 16. Wisd. 9, 5.
, through thy faith do bow the neck of mine heart under the feet of thy
majesty, yielding thee most humble thanks for vouchsafing of thy mercy to
inlighten me, o true light John. 1, 4. 1. John. 1, 5. 7.
, o holy light, o wonderful light, which inlightenest not only every man
that comes into this world John. 1, 9.
, but also the eyes of the Angels in heaven.

Lo, I see now, thanks to thee; Lo, I see the light of heaven; the lightsome
beams of thy countenance do now shine upon the eyes of my mind, and comfort al
my bones.

Oh that it were fully made perfect within me! O Father of light Iam. 1, 17.
, increase it; increase I pray thee, that light which shines upon me: enlarge
it, yea do thou enlarge the same, I beseech thee.

What is this I feel? what fire is this which warmeth mine heart? what light is
it which spreads out such glorious beams upon my mind?

O fire which alwaie burnest, and art never quenched, set me on fire! O light
which alwaie shinest, and art never dimmed, inlighten me. Would to God I were
inflamed by thee!

O sacred fire, how sweetly do thou burn! how secretly do thou shine!
how desirous be they still to burn, whom thou inflamest!

Woe to them, whom thou do not inflame! And woe to them, whom thou do not
inlighten (o true light, lightening the whole world John. 1, 9.
with thy light!)

Woe to the blind eyes that behold not thee, the Sun which give light both
to heaven and earth: woe to the dazeling eyes, which cannot see thee: woe to the
eyes which turn aside and will not see the verity; and woe to those eyes which
will not turn aside from regarding vanity Ps. 119, 37.
.

For the eyes that are used to the darkness, cannot look directly upon the
beams of the most glorious truth Ioh. 3, 19.
: neither can they judge of the light, whose dwelling is in darkness. For they
see nothing but darkness, they love and allow of darkness, and going from
darkness to darkness, they know not where they fall. Miserable are they which
forgo they wot not, what: but more miserable are they which know what they
loose; which fall with open eyes, and go down quick Nomb. 16, verse. 30.
into the pit of hell.

O most happy light, whom none see but they which have pure eyes: blessed are
the pure of heart Math. 5, 8. Psalm. 24, 4.
; for they shall see God.

O purging virtue, purge me Psalm. 51, 7.
; heal the sight of mine eyes, that with a sound sight I may behold thee,
whom none but such as have pure eyes can behold.

I beseech thee, o light vnapprochable 1. Tim. 6, verse. 16.
take away by thy glorious beams ye scales which a long time have dimmed the
sight of mine eyes, that steadfastly I may behold thee, and see light in thy
light Psalm. 36, 9.
.

Thanks to thee, o my light Mich. 7, 8.
, lo I see now. O Lord, I beseech thee, enlarge thou my sight: open mine eyes
Ps. 119, 18.
that I may see the woonders of thy law; who art terrible out of thy holy
places Ps. 68, 35.
.

Lo, thanks to thee my light, I see now, yet through a glass darkly 1. Cor.
13, verse. 12.
. But when shall I see thee face to face Reu. 22, 4. 1. Cor. 13, 13.
? When comes that day of gladness and joy Sal. son. 3. verse. 11.
, wherein I shall enter into the place of thy woonderful tabernacle Psalm. 42, 4.

My soul thirsts after thee, 2.
God, the well of life Psalm. 36, 9.

O fountain of life Psa. 36, 9. John. 4, 10. 13. 14.
, o vein of living waters; when shall I come unto that water of thy sweetenes
out of a desert, wild, and watrie land; that I may see thy power and thy
glory, and quench my thirst through the waters of thy mercy?

I thirst Lord; thou art the well of life Psalm. 36, 9.
, o fill me! I thirst Lord, I thirst even for thee the living God Psalm. 42, 2.
. Oh when shall I come, and appear before thy presence!

Think thou that I shall see that day, I say that day of gladness and joy
Sal. son. 3, verse. 11.
, that day which the Lord has made Ps. 118, 24.
, for us to rejoice and be glad therein.

O that is a glorious and goodly day lasting ever, never at an end Reu. 21, 25

nothing which thou would not have.

There shall be the living life Reu. 21, 4.

shall be neither enemy to assault, nor inticement to carry away; but
sovereign and sure security, and secure quietness, and quiet joyfulness, and
ioiful blessedness, and blessed euerlastingnes, and everlasting happiness, and
the happy Trinity, and unity of Trinity, and deity of unity, and blessed
sight of deity 1. Co. 13, 12 Revel. 22, 4.

O joy above joy! o joy surpassing al joy, beside which there is no joy,
when shall I enter into thee, that I may see my God Reu. 22, 4.
who dwells in thee! I will go thither, and behold this marvelous vision.

But what keeps me back? Alas, that my freedom must yet longer be kept fro
me. O nipping sorrow, how long shall it be said to me, Where is thy God Psalm. 42,
3. 10.
? how long shall it be said to me, Wait, and wait again? And now, Lord, what
wait I for Psalm. 39, 7.
? do not we, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
, wait for the Savior Phil. 3, 20. 21.

facioned like unto his glorious body?

How long shall I wretch be tossed in the fluds of my mortalnes, crieng unto
thee, o Lord, and yet can not be heard!

O Lord, harken how I cry unto thee out of this great sea; and bring me unto
the haven of everlasting happiness.

Blessed are they, who having passed out of the peril of this sea, have found
grace to arrive before thee the safest harbor. Yea, blessed are they indeed,
who have escaped from sea to shore; from exile to their country Heb. 11, 13.
14, etc.

O happy indeed, yea three and four times happy are they, which quite
delivered from al miseries Reu. 14, 13

O everlasting kingdom 1. Pet. 1, 4.

obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and mourning shall fly away Esa. 35, 10

Tim. 2. verse. 12.
, o Lord, clothed with light as with a garment Ps. 104, 2.

O kingdom of everlasting bliss, where thou God the hope of the godly 1.

light without darkness; life without death; and al goodness without any evil is.

There youth never comes to age; life dies not; beauty palleth not; love
cools not; health decaieth not; joy withers not.

There neither pain is felt Reu. 7, 15. 16. 17.

Wherefore happy are they whom God has fetched out of this writched life,
unto so great ioies. But unhappy are we which sail through the waves of this
sea, and by these dangerous gulfes. Unhappy, I say are we whose life is in
banishment Heb. 11, 14. 15.
, and whose way is perilous Job. 7, 1. 2, etc.
; we continue as yet in the streams of water sighing after thee the haven of
the sea.

O our country Heb. 11, 14. 15.
, o our quiet Reave. 21, 4.
country, we ken thee a far off, we salute thee out of this sea, we sigh
after thee Psalm. 42, 1. 2.
out of this vale, and with tears we tug hard to come unto thee, o Christ,
God of God Ioh. 8, 42. John. 13, 3. John. 16, 27. 30.
, the hope of mankind 1. Tim. 1, 1.
, our strength and refuge, whose brightness does inlighten our eyes a far off,
as the beam of the sea star does in the dark clouds of the raging sea;
that we may be directed unto thee the haven of rest!

O Lord, with thy right hand govern thou our ship by the stern of thy cross,
that we perish not in the ways, and that the tempest of water drown us not,
nor the deep swallowe us up: but with the hook of thy cross draw us back
unto thee our only comfort, whom we behold a far off, as the morning star,
almost with weeping eyes looking for us upon the shore of the celestial contrie.

Behold, we whom thou have redeemed Esa. 35, 10 Gala. 3, 13. Tit. 2, 14.
Revel. 5, 9.
, we I say thy banished as yet Heb. 11, 14. 1. Chro. 29, verse. 15. 2. Cor. 5.
6. 9.

cry unto thee; Hear us, o God of our salvation, the hope of all the ends of
the earth, and of them that are far off in the sea Psalm. 65, 5.
.

We abide in the troublesome sea, and thou standing upon the shore beholdest al
our dangers: o save us, we pray thee, for thy name sake Ps. 44, 26. Psalm. 79,
9.

Give us grace, o Lord, among these dangers to hold and keep such a course,
that each peril escaped, we may come safe unto the haven both with ship and
merchandise, Amen.

Chap. 36.
Again touching the glory of our celestial country.
WHerefore when we shall come unto thee the well of wisdom, unto thee the lasting
light, unto thee the light which cannot be extinguished, so that we may see
thee, not through a glass darkly 1. Cor. 13. Verse. 12.
, but face to face, then shall our desire be satisfied. For there shall be
nothing without us to be wished for, but thou, o Lord, the sovereign goodness
Iam. 1, 17.
: who wilt be the reward of the blessed, the dia^^me of their glory, and the
everlasting joy upon their heads Esa. 35, 10.
, bringing peace unto them both inwardly and outwardly in thy peace which
passes al understanding Phil. 4, 7.
. There we shall see thee Rell. 22, 4.
, love thee, and praise.

In thy light we shall see light. For with thee is the well of life Psalm. 36, 9.
, and in thy light we shall see light.

And what manner of light? A light unmeasureable, a light without body,
incorruptible, incomprehensible, a light which fails not Esa. 35, 10 Reave* 7,
15. 16. 17.
, a light unquenchable, vnapprochable 1. Tim. 6, verse. 16
, uncreate, a true light, an heavenly light; which lighteneth the eyes of
Angels, which comforts ye strength of the righteous, which is the light of
lights Iam 1, 17.
, and the fountain of life Psalm. 36, 9.
, which is none other things, but even thou, o Lord my God Psalm. 7, 1. 3.
.

For thou art the light in which light we shall see light Psa. 36, 9
, that is thy self in thy self in ye brightness of thy countenance, when we
shall see thee face to face 1. Cor. 13. verse. 12. Reave. 22, 4.
.

What is it to see thee face to face, but even, as the Apostle says 1. Cor.
13, 12.
, To know even as I am known: to know thy truth and thy glory?

To know thy face is to know the power of the Father; ye wisdom of the Son;
the mercy of the holy Ghost; and the single and simple essence of the
glorious Trinity.

For to see the face of the living God Mat. 16, 16. Acts. 14, 15. Romans 9, 26.

, perfect happiness Esa. 35, 10. Revel. 21, 4. 29.
, the joy of perpetuity; ye peace of God, which passes al understanding
Phili. 4, 7.
.

This is full happiness indeed, and all the glory of man, even to see the face
of his God 1. Cor. 13, verse. 12. Reave. 22, 4.
; to see him that made heaven and earth Genesis 1, 1. Acts. 4, 24. Heb. 1, 2. 10.
; to see him that has made man Genesis 1, 26. 27. Psalm. 100, 3.
, that has saved man Phil. 3, 20. 1. Tim. 4, 10.
, that has glorified man Romans 8, 30.
.

Man shall see God in knowing him; like him in loving him; and praise him in
possessing him. For he shall be ye heritage of his people Psa. 28, 9. Psalm. 33,
12. Esaie. 19, 25.
; of his holy people, of the people whom he has redeemed Gal. 3, 13. 1. Pet.
1, 18. Revel. 5, 9.
. He shall be the possession of their felicity, he shall be the reward, and
recompense of their hope. I will be, says he Genesis 15, 1.
, thine exceeding great reward. For great things beseem a great person.

In good sooth, o Lord my God Psa. 7, 1, 3.
, thou art much greater than al Gods Exo. 18, 11
; and thy reward is exceeding great Genesis 15, 1.
.

Neither art thou great, and thy reward little: but as thou art great, so is
thy reward great. For thou art not one thing, and thy reward another.

But thou thy self art exceeding great; thou thy self art an exceeding
greatreward Genesis 15, 1.
. Thou thy self art both the crown, and the crowner; the promise, and the
promiser; the gift, and the giver; the rewarder Revel. 2, 7. 17.
, and the reward of everlasting bliss.

Thou art then the crowner, and the crown, o my God, and the diadem of mine
honor, adorned with glory, the brightness comforting, the light renewing, the
glory adorning, my great hope, the desire, and thing desired Psalm. 42, 1. 2.
from the heart of al Saints.

Thy sight therefore is all the recompense, all the reward, all the joy which we
look for.

For this is eternal life, this, I say, is thy wisdom: This is eternal life
Ioh. 17, 3.
, that we know thee to be the only true God, and whom thou haste sent Jesus
Christ.

So that when we shall see thee 1. Cor. 13, verse. 12. Reave. 22, 4.
, the only true God Deuteronomy. 6, 4. Mala. 2, 10.
, living Mat. 16, 16 Acts. 14, 15. Romans 9, 26.
, almighty Genesis 35, 11 Revel. 4, 8.
, simple Psa. 86, 10. Esaie. 37, 16. 20.
, invisible Col. 1, 15. 1. Tim. 1, 17.
, who can neither be contained Ioh. 23, 8. 9.
, nor comprehended Ier. 32, 18. 19.
; and thine only begotten Son Job. 3, 16. 18. 1. John. 4, 8. 9.
, of one substance with thee Heb. 1, 2. 3.
, and coeternal Heb. 13, 8.
, even Jesus Christ our Lord Romans 1, 1. 3. 7. 1. Cor. 16, ver. 22. 23. 24.
, whom thou did send into the world Ioh. 6, 29, 38.
, for our salvation in the power of the holy spirit; three in persons Mat. 3,
16. 17. Mark. 1, 10. 11. Luke 3, 21. 22.
, and but one in substance: an holy Leuitic. 11, verse. 44. 45. Revel. 16,
verse. 5.
, and God alone Esa. 37, 16 20.
, beside whom there is no God Deuteronomy. 33, verse. 26.
, then we shall have what now we seek, namely eternal life Gal. 6, 4. Reuela.
2, 7.
, everlasting glory Reu. 21, 4. 23, etc.
, which thou have prepared for them which love thee 1. Cor. 2, 9.
; and laid up for them that fear thee Psa 31, 19.
; and wilt give to them which seek thee Psalm. 24, 6.
, Isaie, which continualie do seek thy face.

And thou, o Lord my God, which did take me out of my mothers bowels Psalm.
71, 6.
, which reco^mended me into thine hand, suffer me not any more, I beseech
thee, to be distracted so on every side; but bring me from outward things
unto my self; and fro my self unto thee, that mine heart may alwaie say unto
thee, My face has sought thee out, Lord I will seek thy face Psalm. 27, 8.
, the face of the Lord of hosts Psalm. 59, 5.
, wherein all the everlasting glory of the saints consists.

The sight whereof is eternal life, and the everlasting glory of the saints.

Wherefore let mine heart rejoice, that it may fear thy Name. Let the heart of
such as seek the Lord Psalm. 24, 6.
, rejoice: but much more the heart of such as find him.

For if there be joy in seeking, how great shall be the joy in finding!
Wherefore I will alwaie earnestly seek thy face, yea vncessantlie will I seek
the same, if happily the gate and door of righteousness may be opened unto
me Psa. 118, 19
, that I may enter into my masters joy Mat. 25, verse. 21. 23.
.

This is the gate of the Lord Ps. 118, 20.
: the righteous shall enter through the same.

A prayer unto the holy Trinity.
O BLESSED Trinity, three Mat. 3, 16. 17. Mark. 1, 10. 11. Luke. 3, 21. 22.
, coequal and coeternal persons, one Deuteronomy. 6, 4. 2. Ki. 19, 15. 19.

God, Father Mat. 11, 25 Mar. 13, 32.
, Son Ioh. 3, 16. 18. 1. John. 4, 9.
, and the holy Ghost 2. Cor. 13, verse. 13.
, which alone inhabitest the eternity Esa. 57, 15
, and the light that no man can attain unto 1. Tim. 6, verse. 16.
: who have made the earth by thy power Ier. 51, 15.
, and rulest the world by thy wisdom:

Holy, holy, holy Esaie. 6, 3. Revel. 4, 8.
, Lord God of hosts, dreadful Deuteronomy. 7, 21. Dan. 9, 4.
and mighty Exodus 20, 5. Psalm. 24, 8.

, one essence, power, wisdom, goodness, and one undivided Trinity: Open to
me, which call unto thee, the gate of righteousness Ps. 118, 19.

Lo most honorable householder, I a poor beggar knock at thy door; command
the door to be opened to me which knock, who have said Mat. 7. 7.
, Knock and it shall be opened.

For doubtless ye groans of my paned bowels, and the cry of the tears of mine
eyes knock at thy gate, o most merciful Father.

O Lord, my whole desire is before thee Psalm. 38, 9.
, and my sighing is not hid from thee.

O Lord, hide thy face no longer fro me Psalm. 27, 9.
, neither cast thy servant away in displeasure.

Most merciful Father, hear the complaint of thy son, and reach him thine
helping hand that it may bring me out of the horrible pit Psalm. 40, 2.
, out of the lake of misery, and from the miry clay, that I perish not in the
sight of thy pitiful eyes, and in the presence of thy bowels of mercy: but may
escape unto thee my Lord God Psalm. 7, 1, 3. Matthew. 4, 7. 10.
, that I may see the riches of thy kingdom, and evermore behold thy face 1.
Cor. 13, verse. 12. Reu. 22, 4.
, and sing praises to thine holy name.

O Lord, which do woonderous things Psa. 72, 18
, comfortest mine heart through the remembrance of thee, and inlightenest mine
youth, cast me not off in the time of mine age Psalm. 71, 9.
, but rejoice al my bones, and renew my strength like the Eagles Psa. 103, 5.
