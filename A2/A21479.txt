Lover, OR The Melancholy Knight.

Originally written in the Greek Tongue, by an unknown Author.

Afterward Translated into Spanish; after that, for the Excellency thereof,
into the French Tongue by N. H. next by B. M. into the Thuscan, and now turned
into English Verse by L. L. a well-wisher to the Muses.

Ovid. de trist. Si qua meis fuerint, ut erunt, vitiosalibellis Excusata suo
tempore Lector habe. LONDON: Printed by J. Oaks for H. Mosley, and are to be
sold at his shop, at the Sign of the Princes Arms in Paul's Churchyard, 1639.

To his more than Honored Uncle Adam Lawrence: Leonard Lawrence wishes
increase of happiness, with the Years of Nestor.
Sir,
WHen first I Translated this small Treatise of Arnalte and Lucenda, I was
Resolved to have tendered it to Your Honored view, fairly written in a
well-pen'd Manuscript: but since that time my Resolutions are altered, yet not
so much through my own desires, as by the persuasion of some well-wishing
friends; who earnest to have some Copies of (I must confess) these my weak
Endeavors, encouraged me to send it to the Press, thereby to avoyde the
tediousness of writing: To these their motions I was easily persuaded, and
that the rather, 'cause my Subject had formerly been a Printed Object: (though
in another tongue) Yet I protest no vain ambition, no phantastique desire, to
be perspicuous to the transparent eye of the world incited me, but only the
importunity of friends: this I hope will excuse my forwardness, either to Your
worthy self, or any indifferent Reader; the ingenious I am sure will encourage
my resolutions; and as for the Hidra-headed multitude, let them spit the venom
of their malicious Envy, and spare not; for I have already prevented the
operation of their poison, with an Antidote of sufficient worth, which is, my
neglect of such Critical dispositions: and if this be not sufficient, why the
two Capital Letters of Your ever-honour'd name, is of force enough to confound
them with amazement. For which reason, I knowing it to be customary to such as
write Books, to Dedicate their Labors to some one or other; some tendering
their Works to the view of Grand-Personages, (I will not say in hope of
reward) others to their special friends, (perhaps in respect of love and
familiarity) yet both (I am confident (with intent, that they may be set forth
to the perspicuous eye of the world; have chose Your most respected Self, to
Patronize my post-ensuing Lines; not knowing any so worthy, or more judicious,
or to whom I am more oblieg'd. Or have I dared to tender them to the acceptance
of any other, since they are Yours, and You may justly claim them, I having
Devoted all my Services to Your Candid self. These if You daigne to protect,
I Will not care for Carping Momus, or Barking Zoylus, though they should tax me
with a Westminsterian Epitaph: albeit I confess I was never such a pretender
to Learning (though I know not much) as to steal whole Verses, though it be
lawful to Quacke-salve Lame Lines with helping words, and two Physicians use
one and the selfsame Simples (though differently Compounded) but to write
Verbatim, I Would not affront any man's ingenium, so ignobly, or dishonor my self
so basely, though thousands know it not: one may come with Virgils Verse in his
mouth, and say, Hos ego versiculos feci, tulit alter honores.
But's no matter, such Censurers may use their freedom, I will not say of
ignorance or envy, if of either I care not: It Is Your Honored self, whom I
observe: so you be pleased, it imports not who is offended.

My Genius having prompt me to present these unpolisht Lines to Your judicious
Censure; I shall entreat You Would pardon the faults my English Style affords;
and attribute them to my unskilfulnesse; I must confess (and believe) there
be many, yet since more sublimer Wits have had some, mine may be the more
excusable; for if the finest Lawne have an Iron-mould, (witness Your self) it
may be borne withal in a courser piece.

But what need I direct the freeness of Your Noble Disposition, or the
generosity of your super-excellent mind, since the Transcendency of Your
judgment, manifests that you will have this consideration; that a small hair
cannot give so great a shadow as a big Cable, nor a Needles point, so large a
circumference as a wide Circle. I need not unfold the aenigma of my meaning,
Car, au, bon entendeur ne fault que demi parolle. As Painters draw a
Counter-Figies by a living Object; so have I enterpriz'd to translate a Book,
being a Printed Subject; yet if I give not a true resemblance, or lay my
shadows right, representing the Idea of my Prose, though Metamorphis'd into
Verse, impute it to my want of Art, not of Desire: Thus, if you please to
protect these my employments, which kept my Wits busy for some spare hours,
from the taxations of false-opinionate men, whose Critical Censures I may
compare to Paris Darts, or Cephalus Shafts, which transpierce the best Armor
of proof, though of Vulcans own forging. I Will promise, when as I am grown
more cunning, and can mix my colors better, to Present You with some more
serious Piece: In the interim I, tendering these to Your protection, recommend
You to the tuition of the Universal Rector, who Felicitate all Your
Enterprises; whilst I, with all respect, and submissive Reverence, humbly kiss
Your hands, and remain in hope of the continuance of Your Favors,

Your well-wishing, and most affectionate Nephew: Leonard Lawrence.

To the Noble-minded READER.
SIR, if my Lines should chance come unto
The worthy prospect of your noble view,
Although they are (I must confess) unfit
To walk in equipage with better Wit;
Nor worth th'observance of your curious Eye,
Yet read them pray, and pass their faults; for why
A stock ungrafted never yet could yield
Such pleasant fruit as pruned Trees: the Field
Vntill'd (you know) can nothing else produce,
Unless wild weeds, good to no wholesome use.
Wild Grapes, though pressed, yield no such pleasant wines
As the rich clusters of the manured Vines:
Or can the Crab-tree such an Apple bear
As the fair Pippin; then Sir, shall I dare
Presume to think my Genius or my Brains
Can Echo forth such high Cothurnick strains,
As those ingenious Wits, who well may claim
The sacred Title of a Poets name?
Far be it from me to harbor such a thought,
Since in respect of such, I Am worse than naught
By many thousands: thus your pardon daigne,
Excuse my faults, 'twill recompense my pain:
For know some time my Muse and I have spent
This Work to finish, which I now have sent.
For since Report had falsely blazed, that I
Could steal whole Verses, but not versifie,
I chose a Subject thereby to express
The skill I have, how to compact a Verse.
Yet Sirs, bear with me, though they do not run
With fluent strains most sweetly on your tongue*
I never was lulled asleep upon the lap
Of some sweet Muse, I never took a nap
Under the shadie Leaves of Phoebus Tree,
The Groves of Tempe I did never see.
The are the first blossoms of my unskilled Brain,
Which if you please to cherish and maintain,
With the bright Sunshine of your favor, then
The uipping Frosts of selfe-opinionate men,
Nor Envies blasts shall never have the power
To crop the Bud of this my growing Flower.
This if you grant, 'twill tie me to remain
Your constant Friend, to which I sign my Name.
L. LAVVRENCE.

To all Fair Ladies, Famous for their Virtues, L. L. wishes the enjoyment of
their Desires; whether Celestial, or Terrestrial, but most especially to
that Paragon of Perfection, the very Non-such of her Sex, famous by the Name
of Mistress M. S.
OH stand my Friends ye sacred Treble-trine
Of divine Sisters, oh ye Muses Nine,
Inflame my Genius, and my thoughts inspire
With the bright beams of your Aetheriall fire:
Oh teach me words which yet were never known,
The choicest Strains that flow from Helicon,
And rape me up with Raptures 'yond the pitch
Of vulgar thought; my obtuse mind enrich
With quick Invention, for I have a task
Beyond my skill, therefore your aid I ask.
Be then propitious unto my designs,
And prompt my thoughts, that I in strenuous Lines,
And words compacted by your proper pain,
May gain excuse; yet lest I should profane
The sacred worth of those Fair Ladies, who
May claim all honor as their proper due,
What Attributes, what honored Titles shall
My trembling Tongue, my Faculties, and all
My laboring Senses study to confer
On their Rare worths, who scarce know how to err?
Call I them Ladies? why their Sex does claim
The proper Title of that Gentile Name:
Style I them fair ones? of an Angels hue,
That Is but their right, I give them but their due:
Say I they are virtuous? why their actions show
It most apparent, and the world does know
I should but flatter, if I should confine
My Tongue to style them Goddesses divine:
Though others use it, pardon me, not I,
I have no power for to Deifie,
Though I adore ye, and would sacrifice
My Life to serve ye: what shall I devise,
What shall I add, or what shall I express
To sound your praises? Oh I must confess
It is a Subject for an Homers Quill,
By far transcending my unlearned skill:
M' Invention's dull, or is it so sublime,
To touch your worths, you being most divine:
What new-coyn'd Titles, what unheard of strains
Shall I then frame, to blazon forth your fames?
Alas, I Would best strike sail, waft to the shore,
And Anchor there, not dare to venture over
This Sea of Honor, 'lesse I had the Art
Of Heraldry, your Titles to impart,
Or skill to blaze them in their several Tables
Drawn out with Or, with Argent, and with Sables;
Gules, Furs, and Azure, Bands, Bars, Chev'rons, crosses,
Bulls, Bears, and Lions, with the well-shap't Horses:
Or that my Bark were better rigged and trimmed,
Or that I had a fairer gale of wind
TO embreath the sails of my most slake Invention,
And so transport me with quick apprehension.
And now more than my Tongue can style ye, know
I am oblieg'd and eke engaged to show
Unto the prospect of your glorious eyes,
The sighs, the sobs, the woes, the miseries
Of tortured Arnalt, who does living dye
Through the unkindnesse and strange cruelty
Which fair Lucenda shows him: this his Fate
He does entreat you to compassionate,
And to bewail his sufferings, to complain
Of her neglect and tyrant-like disdain,
Which is the cause of his afflicting smart,
And of the tortures which infest his heart.
Oh if you chance but ever to distill
A Pearle-like tear, he does believe it will
Be of such force, that it will mollify
Her flinty heart, convert her cruelty
To courteous kindness, move her to repent
Her peevish coyness, cause him sweet content.
Then oh ye Rare ones, since ye thus may save
Our ill-intreated Lover from the grave,
Express your pity, oh bewail his fate,
Tax the unkindnesse and invet'rate hate
Of coy Lucenda, blame her for neglect:
Oh tell her, tell her, that such true respect
She does not merit, since she still disdaines
His profer'd love, his service, and his pains:
And let the beams of your bright goodness shine
Also fair Ladies on these Lines of mine,
Which though unworthy of your gracious view,
Vouchsafe to read, they being sent to you;
'Twill please sad Arnalt, and exhilarate
His pensive thoughts; perhaps 't may recreate
Your fancies wearied with excess of pleasure,
But 'twill reward me with too rich a Treasure,
And so engage me, that I shall not know
How to obsolve the Debts the which I owe
Unto your worths, for why, they cannot be
Repaid without some new-coyn'd Mystery:
Thus with my Book I kiss your fair white hand,
And at the Bar of your just knowledge stand
To hear our Doom; it is you must Judgment give
If by Oblivion we shall dye, or live
With Fame eternized: give your Verdict then,
And with it life in spite of envious men.
Say you will protect it, say 't shall take a nap,
Encurtain'd closely in your silken laps:
Grant this sweet Ladies unto him who still
Will be obsequious to your honored wills,
Yea, unto him, who ever will remain
More than your servant, well known by the name
of L. L.

To his respected second-selfe L. L.
HOW can thy worth be more expressed, than by
The pleasant fruits of the ingenuity?
The praise whereof shall tend to thy renown,
Yea, bind thy Temples with a Laurel Crown:
Envy may bark, but shall not bite thy name,
Nor yet have force to rob thee of thy Fame.
Heed no aspersions, set thy self at rest,
The suppressed Palm fructifieth best:
Apollo's Sons, Minerva's Darlings will
Applaud thy Genius, and maintain it still.
Thy private friends (experienced) will confess
There Is worth, there is wit, there is learning in thy Verse:
And thy familiars, wishing thee the Bays,
Have song Encomiums to thy lasting praise.
Shall I now laud thee? no, 't must be some other;
My reason's this, because I am thy brother
J. Lawrence.

To his worthy Friend the Author, upon his Translation.
THY Arnalt sad, yet sweetly sung, will move
In all delight and pleasure, win their love.
So Philomel, whilst of her Rape she plains,
The senses ravished with delightsome strains.
Then do not suffer this thy work to dwell
With dull Oblivion in her gloomy Cell:
What though thy Arnalt does himself confine
To Groves? yet to the World let thy Muse shine:
Fear not the ill-intreated Lovers Fate,
All lovingly will 'treate thy Muse, none hate.
W. M.

To His Ingenious Friend the Author, upon his Translation.
I Have beheld, with an admiring eye,
These thy first blossoms of sweet Poesy,
Sprung from thy Infant-Muse, whose leaves do show
A fragrantnesse; although they did not grow
Nigh Helicon, or on the fertile strand
Of sacred Tempe, or Parnassus Land.
Thy Verse (though sad) is fraught with such sweet Lays,
That it deserves the ever-verdent Bays
Of famed Apollo, for I vow you merit,
If for reward, a greater to inherit.
Thou show us Arnalt, yes, and thy Translation
Shows thy Genius, and thy Education:
And we that can no French, are bound to thee
In bonds of love, for letting us to see
His Love-sicke Story most exactly writ
In English Verse, penned by thy fluent wit.
No more I Will say, friend Lawrence, for thy worth
It Is badge enough to set thy virtues forth;
For who so reads thy Lines, they will confess
Thy Muse runs well, having o're-tane the Press.
R. Knowles.

To his much esteemed Friend L. L. upon his Translation of Arnalte and Lucenda.
I Must confess, these Lines which thou have writ,
Express (kind friend) thy Genius and thy Wit:
And these thy Verses have revived in me
The e'ne dead sparks of pleasing Poetry:
'Cause I Would say something in the commendation
Of this thy Poem, and well-pen'd Translation:
I do not write to beautify thy Work,
Nor under covert of thy sheets to lurk,
And so to crowd into the Press, not I,
But to applaud thy ingenuity:
The Greeks, the Italians, Spaniards, Frenchmen too,
They are beholding Sir, I vow to you:
My reason's this, since by thy pains and Pen,
The have taught pure English to their Countrymen,
And thereon their worth's perspicuous to our Nation.
By this thy copious and refined Translation.
Had thou been tutored, or at first brought up
To quaffe of Nectar in a golden Cup,
IN de never admired these thy strenuous Lines,
Nor yet have wondered at thy well pen'drimes:
But's strange, me thinks, that one who daily uses
To trade, and traffiicke, thus should Court the Muses:
Then thrive in Raptures, and transcendent Lays,
That Fame may Crown thee with a wreath of Baies.
N. P.

To his much Honored Friend, L. L.
IT were in vain for me to blaze thy worth,
This thy Translation plainly sets it forth:
And eke thy Lines, they all are so well penned,
That they alone may serve thee to commend:
Should I extol thee, why it will but show
That to the World, which they already know:
Then all I Will say, the all I do intend,
'T shall be to show, I Am proud of such a friend.
I. A.

To his true Friend, L. L.
ART graceth Nature: yet the grace of Art
Grows from those Gifts, good Nature does imparts
Noe Art, nor Natures gifts are scarce in thee,
Thy Lines will show, which, like thy self, are free.
Thy Natural Genius shines forth in thy brain,
Which Time cannot rust, nor spatring Envy stain:
The Muses bless thee still, as the have begun:
Thus prays thy friend, and thus thy friend has done*
R. M.

The Translator tenders his respect to all ingenious Poets, who, he hopes will
cherish these his Infant Verses, as being the first that he ever Writ.
I Will not venture to usurp or claim
The sacred Title of a Poets name,
Or dare to challenge ought that does belong
Unto their merits, least their worths I wrong.
The Worlds applausive praise I will resign
To Phoebus sons, their Raptures are Divine,
Sublime transcendent; and their Candor's such,
That I can but the superficies touch
Of their perfections: no, I have no skill
To sound their praises, or to guide my quill:
To portraict forth the Idea of their Fame,
Unless by writing of a Poets name;
Yet that is enough; for sweete-ton'd Poesy
Makes men immortal, and does Deifie
Them by their actions: what was ever writ
By a true Poet, Fame eternized it;
Witness an Homer, or brave Horace name,
Propertius, Virgil, or sweet Ovids fame:
Or look but back to these our Modern times,
Spencer, though dead, surviveth by his rimes;
Johnson, and others, needless to rehearse,
Are eternized by their famous Verse;
Unto whose worths, Time-during Fame has raised
Trophies of Honor, to their lasting praise.
Oh that I could but show, or else express
How much I honor the ingenuousnesse
Of great Apollo's darlings, who surpass
So far the Vulgar, as bright Diamonds glass!
My Lines are framed in a Leaden mould,
Their Strains composed of the purest gold;
Whose high-tun'd words, like precious Jems adorn
The Readers ear, too costly to be worn
By every Vulgar Critic, who despite
All sense or reason, be it wrong or right,
Will spit the venom of their malice, and
Censure men's Labors, though not understand:
But's to no purpose; say they what they will,
Poets are Poets, they but Coxecombes still.
A Small Treatise betwixt ARNALTE and LUCENDA: Entitled, The Evill-intreated
Lover.
There Is but a Summer past; the golden Sun,
He has but once his Annual course o're-run,
And lodged his fire-breathing Steeds within
The lofty Stables of cold Pisces Inn:
And fragrant Flora, dewie-breasted Queen
Of Hills and Valleys, which we all have seen
Be-spread with Grasse-greene Carpets, intermixed
With pleasing Flowers, which no Art had fixed.
For by their spreadings and their dispersed show,
One might perceive that Nature caused them grow:
Attended on with Troops of lovely Roses,
Carnations, Lillies, which the Spring discloses;
And diverse sorts of various colored Flowers,
As Pinks and Pawnses, nurs't by Aprils showers.
She has but once with this her Train given place
To wintring Hyems, with his Snow-white face,
Since I a Journey, to my self no gain,
Did undertake; for, for my Friend the pain,
I freely did embrace, for certainly,
The place at distance far remote did lie,
Whereto I was add rest: but with my Steed,
Like Pegasus I did intend to speed.
But having some days spent in this my race,
My fortunes brought me to a desert place,
Set thick with Trees, whose lofty tops aspire
To kiss the Clouds; nay yet to reach more higher,
Spreading their branches with that large extent,
That from my eyes they hid the Firmament;
Joining so close, that they did Phoebus shroud,
As he had been behind some watery cloud;
And interposed his glorious beams, that he
Was forced to peep to spy his Daphnean Tree.
Under their shades the Valleys prostrate lay,
Where Wolves and Foxes did their gamboiles play:
No silly Sheep, or Lambs were ever seen
To browse or feed upon those Plains, though green:
The laboring Ox, nor the Milke-giving Cow
Did e're graze there, or has the sharpe-edg'd Plough
Been ever known to furrow up that Land:
No House or Cottage on that ground did stand,
'Twas unfrequented, not a tract was seen
Of man or beast, 'twas all o're-growne with green,
With Thistles, Thorns, and the scratching Brier:
The Box and Holly which withstand the ire
Of Winters rage, for they are always seen
For to survive, clad in their robes of Green.
No noise I heard, no cry of coupl'd Hounds,
Whose bawling throats do make the Woods resound
Their yelping clamor, all was quiet there:
No lusty Keeper hollowed in his Dear;
'Twas hush and silent less some pretty Rill
Which murmuring ran at foot of some tall Hill,
Or else the whistlings that the Wind did breath,
Which made a rushling amongst the trembling leafes.
No Shepherd pip't the whilst his Flocks did graize:
No pretty Birds did warble out sweet Lays,
Unless 'twere such whose chirping Notes did sound
Anthems of sorrow to the listening ground:
It seemed to be the seat of pensive care,
Of melancholy, and of grim despair.
There mourning sat the harmless Turtle Dove,
And sung sad Dirges on her lifelesse Love:
And sweet-tongu'd Casta, pretty Philomel,
In mourning Lays, Tereus foul lust did tell,
And in sweet strains though sadly did relate
Her sad disasters, and most cruel Rape.
Here did I find that I was gone astray,
And that unwitting I had lost my way;
Then solid care and passion did possess
My wearied thoughts; since that no redress
I could rescounter, for that spacious Field
No guide, no Shepherd, not a man did yield:
Nor this alone my vexed mind did trouble,
The craggy ways my cares did likewise double.
The Continent it was to me unknown,
Nor no address could unto me be shown;
Which forced me wander, till at length I found
My self quite lost, I erring in that ground,
Then being straightened, finding no relief,
The uncouthnesse I did exceed with grief,
'Twixt fear and hope, I there did musing stand,
And with my heavy eyes beheld the Land,
And here, and there, and every where I spy
To ease my heart; at length my curious eye
The Heavens being fair, discerned a distance off
From forth a Grove, the smoke ascend a loffe,
So by that sign I did conjecture then,
That in that place I should rescounter men.
This hope revived me, and then wearied I
'Gan trace the path which to the Grove might lie,
And through the thickest of the Wood with speed
I did direct my almost tired Steed,
But as I traverst through the Wood, to find
Some quiet harbor to relieve my mind,
The pathlesse passage I so tedious found,
That I repented that my self I Would bound
To enterprise it; for the raged shrubs
O're-threw my Steed, and dashed me against the stubs:
The catching, scratching thorny briars then
Entangled me as they had angry been.
Th'untrodden paths with them did eke conspire,
And tript me up, and laid me in the mire;
When straight recov'ring, I re-falling found
There was no pity in that desert ground:
And thus perplex't I did not only grieve,
For I did wish that Fate an end would give
Unto my Travells, and so wishing I
Unto my wished for end a pace did hye:
For though my fortunes had me strangely crest,
That by despair my self was well-nigh lost,
I onward went, I would not quench the fire
That Hope had kindled, with my friend Desire.
I still did journey, but about the time
That golden Phoebus in the West does shine,
I gained a Hill, from whence I might descry
With ease the place, from whence the smoke did fly,
It was a Mansion, which Report did tell,
Belonged unto a man that there did dwell,
Who by his Birth was Gentle, and his fame
Unto the World did testify the same:
This Fabric he of late caused to be built,
Yet was the Front-piece not like others, gilt;
There were no Pillars hewed by curious Art,
Nor did the Marble-stones there bear a part:
No open Walks, no Arched Galleries,
As any past, with prospect pleased their eyes,
But sable black did only make the show,
For as dark Night it seemed from top to toe:
Which when I saw, it did me so affright,
That I abashed, stood at that black sight,
And there my wondering thoughts with rests desire,
Of all my former griefs did quench the fire.
But drawing nigher, Fate did me conduct
Hard by a place, and as my Fortunes luckt,
Where men were walking, 'twas; who when I found
Their sad aspects, and their lamenting sound,
Their mourning habits, and their sorrowing hearts
Did testify, that they did act their parts
In some sad Scene: for by their outward show,
As men possessed with grief, they all did go:
But one amongst the rest, who foremost went,
Whose sorrowing sighs and groans the air did rent,
Who with sad grief bewailing spent the day,
Him did the rest as Lord and Sir obey.
And howbeit, that care had quite and clean
Dried up those Ruby streams, the which were seen
His manly face to stain; and though the Rose,
In striving with the Lilly, there did lose,
Her blushing Color: yet, I pitying, say,
His gentle virtues still did bear their sway;
Nor did his, Face, that likned Cinthias waine,
Unto his Noble parts prove any stain:
And well he showed it; for he no sooner spied
My wearied self, brought there by Fortunes guide,
But did me friendly greet, although that he
Astonished was, my wondering self to see;
But that past over, and by his courteous show
He did declare, that Roses do not grow
On raggy Thistles: for, oh, Noble he,
For to descend my Horse entreated me:
And then the passage of my travels past
He having heard, himself did cause with haste,
For to provide, that Fatigated I,
With careless sleep may ease my drowsy eyes:
Then stretching forth to me his gentle hand,
He did me bring where his sad house did stand,
Which with amazement did afresh renew
My wondering eyes, and my abashed view;
Which I enforced with heed there to observe
The special marks that notice did deserve;
Observing which, unto the Gate we came,
Where neither Love, nor Fate, or flying Fame
Did carved stand; or could I ought else spy,
Unless 'twere three white scroules on which my eyes
Did prying glance; and there I reading found
This sad Inscription, on that Argent ground.
This is the Mansion
Of him that living, dies,
Though death consent not
To close up his eyes.
These Lines I having read deliberately,
We farther went, and my observing eye
Perceived, that all things in that house so sad,
Of mourning grief a representment had:
But though I sadness every where did see,
At that same time I would not curious be
To ask the reason, I omitted it,
Till I should find the time and place more fit.
Onward we walked, and so we entered in
A spacious Hall, where when a while w'had bin,
Ceres and Bacchus, with their plenteous train.
The Tables decked, and then went out again;
But long they stayed not, for they ushered in
Plenty of Viands, which their Trains did bring,
Whereon we fed: then Supper being past,
The grieving Knight he caused me for to haste
Unto my rest, and this kind he did do,
Because my Travailes and my pains he knew:
Which to refresh most courteously he lead
Me to a Chamber, where a sable bed
Did stand erected; where when I was brought,
He sighing left me, asking if that ought
I wanted; and sadly then retiring,
At these strange wonders left me there admiring:
Being alone, the bed it standing nigh,
Upon the Swanny Down, I down did lie:
And as I thought my quiet rest to take,
When silent Night does suffer few to wake:
About the hour, when as the watchful Cock,
The nights shrill Bell-man, and the Pesants clock,
Does give the signal by his early crowing,
That mid-night's past, the cheerful day is growing.
I then did hear sad sorrow breath such groans,
And sob such sighs, and utter forth such moanes,
That the strange noise with wonder did confound,
M'amazed sense, but listening then I found
That 'twas the Knight, with his attendants, who
Breath forth those groans, and made that strange ado,
For with sad Music they did shreeking plain
Of their afflictions, and their smarting pain,
Wailing, their forrowes in nights darkest shade,
'Cause it to sadness some resemblance had;
The direful Screetch-Owle, bear with them apart:
And from her screeking throat did show her Art,
In keeping time with their sad strained moanes,
Or echo like, in answering to their groans:
Hearing this noise, and in the dead of Night,
I do protest, it did me sore affright:
And then I wondered more than e're before,
For strange it seemed to hear them so deplore:
Imagination seized on sleep, caused Morpheus fly,
And wiped his Leaden slumbers from my eyes,
And did unlose those silken bands, wherein
The drowsy god had chained my eyelids in:
For those sad tones, the which I heard that Night,
Refreshing sleep did from my pores affright,
That I lay pausing in my naked bed;
Whilst thousand thoughts did traverse through my head,
But true report has since informed me,
That every night the Knight did usually
Renew with passion his lamenting moanes,
Torturing his heart with endless sighs and groans*
Which moov'd his servants to deplore his Fate,
And to bewail his sad afflicted state:
For love and pity did them jointly bind,
To be conformed to his grieved mind:
Who now will doubt but that disturbed I,
Lay fraught with wonder, since their pittious cry
Chaste sleep away: for with their tears they past
The nights sad hours, grieving whilst they last:
But when the East 'gan vest himself with gray,
Which is the ensuing of a golden day,
All was in silence hushed, they did lay by
Their doleful tones, and their distracted cries.
Rose-cheek'd Anrora, usher to the day,
Had now with-drawne Nights Curtains, called away
Gold-glistering Titan, from fair Tethis bed:
(To whose embraces he was lately fled)
Which when he heard, with speed and haste he hy'd
Unto his Chariot, which he there espied:
Then mounting up his bright refulgent beams,
Gilded the mountains, and the silyer streams:
When stately riding through the Crystal sky,
Vested in Gold, from forth a Church hard by
I heard a Saints-bell sound, whose Tones did call
The circumjacent dwellers (great and small)
Unto that Service, which is styled the Mass,
Or Mattins either: (well we will let that pass,
And to the purpose) then I did espy
My Noble Host, the Knight, with weeping eyes
Enter my Chamber, where he did express
The self same Honor and true Nobleness,
Which he vouchsafed me, the last passed Night,
When Fortune brought me to his courteous sight:
For friendly grasping of my hand, he lead
Me to the place where Service then was read:
Where when arrived, my overcurious eye
Roving about, I chanced for to espy
A Monument, with sable black be-deck'd,
Which sorrowing grief had caused the Knight erect:
And as I since have heard, he does intend
Therein to rest, when Death shall give an end
To all his cares: observing it I found
This sad Inscription which engraved was round,
See here the Memory
Of one that grieves with pain,
Since tha the sight of him nor her
With ease he cannot gain,
Although the Mass, a Service that is divine,
Was celebrated at that present time,
Which claimed attention with a due respect,
Yet Mass and Service did I then neglect,
And there my thoughts, which should have bin divine
Did poise the meaning of each several Line:
And having poised them, yet I did not spare
To note the sorrow that they did declare.
Yet though I those things saw, I troubled was,
Since of the effects I could not judge the cause.
But then from Church, Service being done,
We homeward went, where when that we were come,
We free-fac'd Plenty found, who from her store
Had spread the Table with the Cates all-o're,
Then down we sat, refresh't our appetite;
And dinner past, the sad lamenting Knight
Striving to glad me with some recreation,
The which might keep me in some agitation;
He 'gan discourse, and in's discourse did show
That he the King and Queen full well did know,
Requiring me most friendly to relate
If they attended were with Courtlike state,
Honored and served with true magnificence
As did belong unto their Excellence:
These his demands I well could satisfy,
But let them pass, for with my judging eye
I did perceive that he discourse did frame,
Me for to pleasure and to entertain:
Not from desire that he had to know,
How it with King or Queen or Court did go:
And this I judged because he was so sad,
For he his sorrow always present had;
For, for the most part he both sighed and sorrow'd,
But sometimes listening, then a smile he borrowed;
And so concluding he me to requite,
Did render thanks, and this he did recite:
Know worthy friend, that not without good reason
Our past discourse was framed, nor out of season:
For I to thee the true effects will show,
To find the Spring from whence my tears do flow,
Provided this, that you me pledge do give,
That you will not fail, nay, by the faith you live,
To publish all that my sad tongue shall tell
To virtuous Ladies, who with wit as well
As modesty are graced, oh let such know,
How one does cause me suffer smart and woe
Without just cause, how her obdurate mind
No tears will soften, no entreats make kind:
That from her sex she varies, and despite
Their sweet conditions which do men delight:
She tyrannizes, and to vanquished me,
She is more cruel than man to man would be.
Report this to them, and with grief declare
This sorrowing Note unto their gentle ears,
That they advertised may her folly blame,
And of her cruelty with me complain.
"And now ye Ladies, Angels by your hues,
"I am oblie'gd to tender to your views
"This following Work, the which I heard at large;
"Nor will I fail to execute my charge,
"Since ye by right may claim't; and it is most fit
"That to your censures I should tender it.
Translator to the Ladies.
OH that my Tongue were now with Silver tip't,
Since to ye Ladies I must sing with it:
Nay, I could wish the concave of my throat
Were lined with Brass, since that I the note
Of the sad Knight must sound unto your ears,
And with my Verse express his mourning tears,
Oh! could I gain but little Philomel,
Phoebus sweet Bird, within my breast to dwell,
That she might teach me how to warble forth
A mourning Ditty, for I now am loath
To venture on this following work: for why,
I am unskilled, nor e're could versifie.
And then again, I did it enterprise,
Ere I did find that it unto your eyes
Should be presented: had it been to men,
I Would not have cared, if they had censured them:
But's to your honored sex, you will judge aright,
And on my faults your sweet eyes soon will light:
But pass them Ladies, when ye them espy,
Not on my faults, on me reflect your eyes:
And pardon Ladies, if my Muse affords
No pleasing strains, or if my ill placed words
Express no sweetness, or my halting Verse
Do not run current; for I never converst
With the Nine Muses, never did I clime
Pernassus top, my wits for to sublime;
Helicons sweet water I did never taste,
But if I drank't, it was upon the waste:
Ambrosia, Nectar never did I touch,
Then of my rudeness censure not too much.
But stay my Muse, if you this course do keep,
You Will run astray, and I be forced to seek
A new my Subject: then let us not digress
From our intended purpose, but rehearse
The Knights sad words. Oh neither let my tongue
Injure Arnalte, or the Author wrong.
The Knight to the Traveller.
SIR, I do think that I should injure thee
Beyond all Reason, in a high degree,
If I should fail those secrets to unshrowd,
Which now are veiled under silence Cloud:
Or to declare of my demands the cause,
With their effects, and what the reason was
That moved me to them; for it is not of late
That I the King and Queen, their Princely state
Have truly known; for by their high renown,
Their virtuous goodness which their acts do crown,
Their fames divulged, the world enough does know,
Their honored worths; but for your pains I owe
Some kind requital, since you have declared
All what you knew, and thereof nothing spared:
My thanks I Will tender for to gratify
In some respects thy noble courtesy.
But other reasons moved me to demand
Those fained questions, and my speech was framed
Unto another end; for I mean t'impart
The grieving passions of my sorrowing heart
Unto thy self, and so confer on thee
The Treasureship of all my miseries:
For I believe thou will vouchsafe to rest
Some sort of pity in thy manly breast,
Which will incite thee to bewail my Fate,
And the oppressions of my wretched state'
Causing thee harbor in thy solid brain,
What I recount, that so you may proclaim
In future times the sum of all my grief,
And how I live still hopeless of relief.
Attend me then with silence, but first know
I thanks to Thebes for my nurture owe,
For that is my Nation, which Agenors son,
Cadmus did build, when as he durst not turn
Back to his Father, 'cause he could not gain
His dear Europa, whom great Jove had taine.
With this same Cadmus, the Boeotian King,
I for a long time nourished have been,
And eke a long time's past, since unkind Death
Deprived my Father of his vital breath,
Whose honored self was named as I, Arnalte:
But I Will refrain to certify unto thee
What that he was; for it will ill become
Me for to praise him, since I am his son.
In these past days King Cadmus kept his Court
Within fair Thebes, and his chief'st resort
Was oftnest thither; for which reason, I
Did there recide, and live most constantly;
Following my study, mixed with recreation,
Sometimes with sport, sometimes in contemplation,
Void of all care I lived, my Heart was free,
From Love-sicke passions, or his tyranny:
Whilst thus I lived, in hight of perfect bliss,
Unconstant Fortune (who e're whirling is)
Cast me from forth the seat of man's chief hap,
And flung me head long in Pandoreas lap;
For one a day, when as my self I found
Quiet in mind, and eke in all parts sound,
Free from disturbance of unquiet cares,
Or pensive thoughts, commixt with palid fears,
An eminent man, in Thebes City known:
For Fame his worth on her shrill Trumpe had blown;
Yielded himself unto pale ashie death;
Who Victor-like exhaled his fainting breath:
Unto whose fun'rall Rites and Obsequies,
The stately Courtier and the Burgeous hyes,
And diverse others, who did all intend
To grace the body of their deceast friend,
Whose life-lesse Corpse with many watrey eyes
Was brought to Church in a most solemn wise:
Where when arrived, it in the midst was placed,
During sueh time the Ceremonies last:
And there abode, whilst that with weeping eyes,
His nighest kin the Rites did solemnize:
Chiefly his Daughter; who, alas did seem
Like fair faced Venus, Loves Celestial Queen,
When she wore mourning for the timelesse death
Of sweet Adonis, wonder of the earth:
For she with shreekes, and sad lamenting cries,
Distilled salt tears, which flowed from her eyes,
In that abundant manner, as if all
The rainy showers had been forced to fall,
Trickling along her cheeks, which to my view
Seemed like transparent drops of Pearly Dew
On fragrant Roses, e're the bright-fac'd Sun
Had kissed them dry: tears did not only run
From her bright Crystal Fountains, for she tare
Her silken Vestments, and her flaxe-like hair:
The Cypress Veil, which her fair face did shroud,
Like golden Phoebus in a watery Cloud,
She rent in pieces, with her snow-white bands
Disheveled her curious breded bands,
The winds enamored, ravished with delight
At the fair prospect of so rich a sight,
Breath forth their milder gales and gently blew
Their fanning winds, by which her bright hair flew
In amorous dangling, frisling her fair tresses,
Which in Meanders hung, and curled esses:
And like the surges of the rolling maine
They rise and fall, or as upon some plain,
We see the pretty rising Hillocks stand,
Or as the furrows of the plowd up Land;
These Sunne-like Tresses twined in artlesse knots,
Where in close ambush wanton Cupid lurkes,
She did unroote without the least respite,
She waged a War, maintained a deadly fight,
'Twixt her fair Hands, and those disheveled hairs,
Which without pity from her Head she tears;
And they not able to with-stand her might,
Overcome in battle, trembling took their flight
In scattered troops, and some quite dead did lie
On her spread shoulders, obvious to the eye
Of the beholders; in that pittious hew,
That those that did this cruel conflict view,
At their rare beauty did not only wonder,
But grieved to see them severed so assunder,
Pitying their usage, and their ruined state,
Seeking to save them, though, alas, too late:
Overcome with passion, and distracting woe,
Half mad with sorrow; she, oh she did throw
Her tender body on the senseless ground,
And there lay groveling with her tears e'ne drowned*
Her acclamations mixed with grievous groans,
Her sighs, her sobs, her sad lamenting moanes
Were powered forth, in that distracted wise,
That all who saw her jointly sympathiz'd
With her in sorrow; some bewailed her Fate,
Others her loss, the rest compassionate:
Those outrages, the which she did inflict
On her fair self; alas, she did commit
Such cruelty, that pity moov'd all those
That were spectators of her grievous woes,
To have a feeling of her inward smart,
Whose cruel tortures did infest her heart:
For every one did tax this Virgins Fate,
And her sad sorrows caused them Lachrymate:
Since in her passions she was so extreme,
For to her grief she limited no mean;
Which so surprest her, that she seemed to be
The very abstract of calamity.
But now, alas! she of whom I speak,
Whose sad Remembrance makes my heart to break;
Oh she it is! yea, she that bears the name
Of fair Lucenda! my e're honored Dame.
Then list awhile, and my sad tongue shall tell,
How she in worth all others does excel:
I Will thus describe her in each several eye:
A Cupid sits enthroned with Majesty,
Virtue attends her, modesty does grace
The Rose-like blushes of her lovely face:
Her pure complexion does surpass the snow,
And stains the Lillies in their milke-white show:
The pleasing Grace, which makes her lovely seem,
May claim precedence of the Paphian Queen:
Like polished Ivory does her forehead shine;
Her soft silk Tresses in Meanders twine;
And are so bright, that Phoebus he does shroud,
If her he spies, his face behind a Cloud:
As sparkling Diamonds shine her splendent eyes,
Or as bright stars, which twinkle in the skies,
Whose radient beams do such a luster dart,
That with a flash they have consumed my heart:
Her nose's well featured, of the handsom'st mould,
Not long, or peaked, signs that grace a scould:
Her cheeks resemble two fresh flowery banks,
Where bright Carnatious grow in dispersed ranks;
And in those cheeks the red and whit discloses
Such pleasing glimps, as Lawne over spreading Roses:
Her Lips like Rubies, which by Art are joined,
Do sweetly close, and friendly are combined;
And for their color, they by far exceed
The Rosiate blood, which purple Grapes do bleed;
Who when they move, they presently do show
Of Orient Pearls, a well-ranged row:
Her Organ-voyce it may parallel
The sweete-tun'd notes of pretty Philomel;
Nay, far surpass, the Spheres it may exceed,
For if she sing her tones do raptures breed:
Her breath so fragrant, that it does surscent
The Arabian Spices, those from India sent:
A lovely Dimple sets forth her Chin,
And wanton Cupid plays bo-peepe therein:
A snow-white neck supporteth eke her head,
And from that neck two fair large shoulders spread:
Her Virgin bosom branched with swelling veins,
Distilled from Heaven in Aprilian raines;
Whose Azur'd Dye does stain the Saphiers hew,
And make 'em yield that they are not so blew;
Bears two white hills, whose whitenes may compare
With snow, or Down, the which the Swan does wear;
Soft as white wool, or as the airy bed,
Whereon Queen Juno lost her maidenhead;
Upon whose tops, two pretty Arbours stand,
Composed of Roses, framed by Natures hand:
Betwixt those Hills a pleasant Vale does lie,
And 't's consecrated to Loves Deity;
Much like unto that shadie Grove it is seated,
Where fair Idalia her Adonis treated
For to embrace her, whilst the unkind Lad
Reject her suite, and left her vexing sad.
Her hands and arms, they like unto the rest,
Are well proportioned, and for to be pressed
Within their folds there is no greater bliss:
Oh were my hap that I may purchase this!
For other parts, the which I do not know,
I will not mention, lest I speak too low:
There Is only this, as there are several graces,
In several limbs they have their several places;
And this I Will say, and speak it evermore,
Nature in her has laid up all her store.
Nor is this all, it is but the Cabinet
Wherein a Jemme of greater worth is kept;
A Soul unspotted, free from vulgar stain,
Immaculate, an honorable Name:
A gentle heart, a truely-noble mind,
Not proud, but humble, very courteous, kind;
Rich in good thoughts, of virtues having store,
Judicious, witty, but in vices poor.
In brief, to praise her goes beyond my skill,
'Twould fit a Pensill, or some Poets quill.
But to the purpose; I was sore agash't
At this rare Lady, whose strange acts abasht,
M'admiring self possessed with sudden fear,
For I did doubt that she would lend an ear
Unto th'alurements of despair; for why,
She did afflict her self most cruelly,
And wonder rapt me with amazement, when
I had the prospect of so rich a Jemme,
Being so perfect in each linament,
That like an Angel from Joves Palace sent,
She did appear unto my trembling view,
So fair, so bright, so glorious was her hew.
The Corpse being laid with order in his Tomb,
And publicly before the world inhum'd,
Lucenda thence did wailing home return;
And I likewise, who then began to burn
With new-felt Fire, whose tormenting flame
Tortured my heart with an unusual pain.
Thus being wounded with Loves fiery Dart,
I did endeavor to recure my heart:
Which to effect, the Groves I did frequent,
The Woods, the Fields, that so I might prevent
Love of his purpose; but in vain the fields,
Or silent Woods, no comfort to me yield;
Though solitude I did accompany,
No ease I gained, no help, no remedy:
'Twas labor lost, the place affords no ease,
I still was tortured with my strange disease,
And well I knew incontinent I found
That solitude did not alone abound:
Nor get that hope at random from me sped;
But that all solace from my heart was fled.
The twice Twelve Sisters clad in black and white:
The Day attending, and the darksome Night,
Their charge observing, suffered for to pass,
Thus many a day that runned through their glass;
Whilst I endeavored for to entertain
Dreaming Oblivion, and to sleep my brain
In Lethean water, that I might forget
The fixed Resolves whereon my mind was set:
For since my entrance I so prickly found,
So cruel, cragged, and such thorny ground,
I knew the issue would more tedious be,
And far more rugged unto love-sicke me.
Yet this availed not, albeit time did haste
With flying wings; nor would a minute waste,
The more he flew, the more my pains drew nigh,
In whose hot flames my wounded heart did fry:
'Twas water thrown with Smiths upon the fire,
Which does not quench, but makes it flame the higher
For as my griefs increase and multiply,
With winged speed my helps from me did fly:
Thus in a Lab'rinth I was strangely got,
And there I wandered, having not the knot
To re-conduct me forth, I seeking, stray
In untrod paths, I found no ready way.
Ten thousand thoughts lay hamm'ring in my brains,
Who forged out means how to assuage my pains.
But proved so brittle, that they did not hold
Whilst I assayed them; thus my hopes grew cold
For want of succor, and most wretched I
Endured much anguish, then necessity,
The slye Inventor of unheard of facts,
Th'accomplisher of more than common acts,
By her sage counsel showed me by what ways
I might released be from this strange maize;
And thus advised me, that I by a Page
Who waited on me in his equipage,
And to Lucendas house did often resort,
Her Brother to associate and disport,
Might certify, I having the fit means
To fair Lucenda, (whose transpiercing beams
Inflamed my heart) the passion that I felt
For her sweet self, though I did often melt
To brackish tears, and from my eyes did flow
Such Rivolets as might an Ocean grow.
My thoughts thus having prompt me, I'gan spy
In every place for opportunity:
T'obviate which I did encharge my Page
For to frequent more often, and to engage
Himself more dearly to Lucendas Brother,
Yet on his life m'intents not to discover.
This his imposed charge he modestly
Did execute, with speed sought remedy
In such a wise, that he went in and out
My Ladies Mansion, none did him mis-doubt;
And having diverse times him well advised
For to be secret, and unto his eyes
Presented diverse chastisements, if he
Unto my secrets should disloyal be;
Gave him a Letter, the which did contain
These following Lines written with great pain.
Arnaltes Letter to Lucenda*
THou matchless piece of worth, the Worlds chief treasure*
On whose fair forehead sits a world of pleasure,
Natures sole Darling, and my souls delight;
Fairer than Venus, than the Sun more bright:
For why thy Beauty does by far out-ray
The Orient brightness of a Sunshine day:
If that my fortunes so propitious were
To my desires, as you are Phoenix rare;
I Would rather wish that you were certifi'd
Of my pure Love, purer than Gold though tried,
Or that my Faith and constant Loyalty
Were but perspicuous to your glorious eye,
Then that you should vouchsafe to read my Lines,
Th'Interpreters of my enforced designs:
Had I this favor, (fairest) were it so,
Observing me, you easily might know
The passion that I suffer; which is such,
And so out-raging, vexing me so much,
That 'twould be able freely to obtain,
That which I hoped by Writing for to gain:
For by missive you can only know
My grieving ends, but then my tears would show
The desperate state wherein afflicted I,
Do pass my days in endless misery.
My heaped griefs would likewise then supply
My failing words, and to you testify
The truth of that which now your self may doubt;
And from your breast, distrust they would banish out.
For though the afflictions Fortune has not spared
To let me suffer, cannot be declared,
Yet through my pain your Judgment would conceive
The very truth, the reason why I grieve:
Now since such hap, my hap does not possess,
I Will force my Lines my Sorrows to express.
Know, fair Lucenda, since that very day,
Your Honored Father was involved in clay,
Your more than mortal grace, and my affection
Captived my heart, enthralled me to subjection*
Your shining living Lamps, whose glorious light
Transcend the Stars, that wait on Cinthia bright,
Directed me at that same present time,
To offer to thy self (who seemed divine)
My life, my service, and I vowed to be
A faithful Servant unto honored thee:
Whilst thus I gazed at thy most rare beauty,
The Priests had done unto the Corpse their duty,
And your fair self did homeward then repair:
Whence fleeting time did all your Sorrows bear;
For, for to grieve you found it was in vain,
Since your lost Father tears could not regaine:
You being gone, I likewise homeward went,
Where when arrived, I inwardly did scent
A strange disturbance, all my spirits quak't,
My vitals trembled, Ague-like I shook:
My blood ran boiling in my veins, my heart
Lay panting, throb'd with anxious smart:
And I bewailed the cruel smarting pain,
Which I do suffer from that secret flame
Which love has kindled, dazzling in your eyes,
Whose radiant beams with torments me surpised.
Sweet I beseech thee credit this; believe,
That for thy self I do both pine and grieve,
For I Am so strongly fettered in Loves band,
That naught can free me 'lesse thou lend a hand*
Being as feeble my passions to o're-sway,
As you have force, t'inforce my heart obey:
More over, I thee assure, that want of power
More than my own free will caused me yield over
My thralled self, and tender to thy shrine
My vows, my life, and thus vel nil am thine.
Had I the means, or were I helped by might,
Then from thy face I straight would take my flight:
But spite my will, perforce I am constrained
To seek thee out by whom my heart is pained:
Nor from your beauty (fairest) can I fly,
Since in my thraldom does my freedom lie:
For over me you sway so strong a hand,
And over my self I have so small command,
That if I purpose (Lady) not to love thee,
I am not able, your Graces do so move me:
For why, alas, my wounded sorrowing heart
(...) through thy virtues, my love bearing part:
So firmly knit, and linkt with Loves strong band
To thy sweet self, that naught can it dis-band.
Thus let these Lines (sweet Mistress) certify,
If that I Would had the possibility.
Rather than that I would have hoped in vain,
For help of thee, by whom my heart's nigh slain;
I Would thee have banished from my quiet mind,
Nor thee have suffered harbor there to find
But Fate has order't, and I am condemned
By Destiny, to be thy truest friend:
Or have I had the means to avoid the ill
Of this good hap, which thus remain must still:
Protract not now thy comfort, but with speed,
St^nch thou those wounds that in my heart do bleed:
Heal me, for why, I suffer cruel smart
From thy bright eyes, which have transpierc'd my heart:
Deny me not thy gracious favor then,
But by thy smiles glad me 'bove other men:
For by the greatness of my suffering pain,
I do deserve these favors to obtain;
And since in so few days thy Sunne-like eyes
Have out-ray'd me in a most cruel wise:
Consider in what an Obligation you
Are reduable, and to me it is due:
Since I had rather lose my self for thee,
Than to be saved, unless thy means it be:
And since thou art the cause of my torment,
The pain is pleasing, and gives me content,
And my destruction, for thy sake do I,
Though with great loss, esteem it victory.
Then sweet assist me, let me not despair,
Cherish the affection, which to thee I bear:
Although ay yet no recompense I crave,
For I do hope, when you shall knowledge have
Of the estate, wherein I loving live,
That then your notice will you freedom give
To loose the reins to reason, which you will find
Not to be absent, gracing of your mind:
And whereas reason's present, there'l not want
A large reward, for it will kindness grant:
Now with this hope I straight ways will expel
Unquiet thoughts; despair shall never dwell
Within my breast; but since disposed I am,
Rather to suffer my afflicting pain,
Than to petition, or to intercede
For thy assistance, I will cease to plead
To gain thy favor, 'cause I Will give an end
To this my missive, which I now do send:
Only vouchsafe my teare-drown'd face to see,
That of my griefs it may a testate be:
For why, dear love, a lovers pleading eyes
May more express, than Letters can comprize.
Thus was my Letter finished, yet friend know,
E're I give order that my Page should go
For to deliver't to the milk white hand
Of her, at whom all eyes amazed stand:
I did instruct him in what manner he
Ought to proceed, and careful for to be;
Wisely to choose the place, and time most fit,
To tender to her view what I had writ:
That if perhaps Lucenda should refuse
For to receive it, then she might not choose:
These my commands unto th'obsequious will
Of my observing Page, were pleasing still:
For by his actions he did still express
His love and care to gain me some redress,
Daily endeavoring to relieve me, he
At length had spied her all alone to be;
Then taking hold of opportunity,
He there entreated her as covertly
As possibly he might, that she would vouchsafe
TO accept my Lines, to daigne me so much grace;
How she did like of this Discourse so strange,
She made expression by her colors change:
Nor could she so dissemble, or disguise
Her inward thoughts, but by her blushing eyes
She did reveal them; for we often discry
By outward Symptoms what does inward lie.
Yet never the less my Page, as well advised,
Weighing the pain I suffered from her eyes,
At naught did marvel, but did still entreat
Her gracious pity to assuage my heat:
But she, alas, did no attention lend
To his intreates, nor yet her favor send;
For seeing that she still was importuned,
That on her patience he too far presumed,
Thinking to free her self, she forthwith went
From her soft resting seat with discontent.
Which when my Page perceived, he suddenly,
With large stepped paces after her did hye,
And swiftly speeding, he her over-tooke,
Then threw my Letter where she needs must look,
Which fell so fairly, that necessity
Enforced her will thereon to cast her eye,
And take it up, but with such entertain,
That it a thousand rents did straight ways gain:
Which spightfull act did re-assault my heart,
With a strong troop of more than killing smarts.
For when I saw my hopes thus blasted, and
My griefs still crescent, I had no command
Over my sad soul; a death-resembling cold
Possessed my spirits, and my hopes controlled:
Which deep distemper of my wounded breast
Did so torment me, that it did express
Me more than wretched: thus I still endured
Heart-burning tortures, hopeless to be cured,
Unless pale Death should penetrate my heart
With the sharp edge of his all-killing Dart.
Thus fraught with passion and distracting care,
O're-come with grief, poss'est with grim despair,
Unto my self I grew so strange a foe,
And such a friend unto my smarting woe,
That I embraced it with a great delight,
And entertained it daily in my sight.
For if for refuge or some help I sought,
I had recourse unto my sorrowing thoughts:
And like sad Philomel in mourning Lays,
I warbling, grieving spent full many days;
Until a morning which with ruddy look,
Did drive dim mists from off the silver Brooks,
And that Aurora clad in Purple gay,
Had chased black Night, and brought on cheerful Day,
Or that bright Titan in the Eastern streams
Began to bathe his fiery-flaming beams;
For then my Page who still was circumspect,
And took great heed m'affaires not to neglect,
Came in and told me how Lucenda, she
The following night resolved for to be
At divine service; this then straight-wayes past
For truth unto my breast, since th'Eve it was
Of Christ his Mass: (Oh ever honored time,
Too great a Subject for my love-sicke Rhyme)
Having heard this, I straight ways summoned in
My Wits to counsel what I should begin.
Then for to ease my sad afflicted heart,
I did intend a new projected part;
Which to accomplish I resolved, disguised
In Ladies habit for to blind the eyes
Of slye suspicion; so for to draw near
My honored Lady, sitting void of fear,
Hoping by that fine slight for to prevent
The babbling tongue of dangers utterment;
Then being accoutr'd every way complete,
Vested like her I went, and took my seat
Nigh to the place whereas she used to be
At any time of high solemnity;
And she not doubting of my cunning plot,
(For so disguised alack she knew me not)
At her arrival, though her tongue were mute,
With courtesy she did me then salute.
Nights Negro Queen, having the earth o're-spread
With her black veil, and in bright Phoebus stead,
Pale Luna shining with her spangl'd train,
Whose glimmering lights did dart a twinkling flame:
I found occasion since the silent Night,
Th'obscure place (which might some others fright)
Propitious proved, these words for to declare
Unto Lucenda in perfections rare.
Arnalte to Lucenda being disguised.
REnowned Lady, famous by the Name
Of fair Lucenda, which you truly claim;
Had I the Elixer of all humane wit,
Or were my tongue with Gold or Silver tipped:
Were I composed of Rethorick, could my words
Sound forth more sweetness than the true accords
Of Lutes, or Harps, or might my Genius claim
Precedence of smooth'd-tongu'd Tullies fame,
Yet were my words too mean I must confess,
For your attention, sweetest I profess;
Not able for to counterpoise the grace
Which does adorn your Angelick face!
For these same Reasons let me (Sweet) entreat
Thee not to heed what that my tongue shall speak;
For had I (Fairest) but such skill to plain
Of thy unkindnesse, a to have might to pain
My yielding heart, I Would justly then declare
My self as learned as you are beauteous fair:
But mark the passions of my wounded heart,
The Abundance of my sighs, whose cruel smart
At this same instant I present to thee;
That of my pain they may affirmers be.
I do not know what gain you hope to get
Out of my loss, what good you do expect
From my ill hap, for I have let you know
By my sad Lines, that I my life do owe
Unto thee Lady by my misery,
Expressed my self sole yours until I die:
Yet armed with rage, dispightfully you tor'd
My sad Epistle, wherein I implored
Thee to release me from that anxious pain
Which thou have caused me (Fairest) to sustain.
You ought to have given leave unto my Lines
To Have done their message, by which my designs
You might have known, and how in passions I
Have ever lived, since first of thee my eye
(Guided by Fate) so fair a prospect gained,
That to thy self I find my heart enchain'd:
Persevere not I pray so vehemently,
Nor be not thus resolved; alas for why?
The cloudie mists of base report will stain
The lively gloss of your renowned fame*
Nor will your fame alone endamag'd be,
For I shall suffer through your tyranny,
And lose a jemme prized beyond all wealth,
(Man's chiefest hap) the enjoyment of my health:
Where will thou find excuse, whose force may serve
Thee to acquit of what thou do deserve?
Or warrantise thee too, too cruel action
Of these strange acts, or their offending fashion.
Thou hear'st the anguish with the which my tongue
Does crave redress, for my heart-killing wrong:
Full well you know that Virtues differ far
From rigorous forces; how in kind they are
Unlike each other, that you cannot be
Virtuous, if cruel; kind, if harsh to me;
Nor can you (fairest) Virtues period gain,
Unless you gracious courtesy retain:
Then since it in your gracious power does lie,
With one poor word fully to satisfy
And recompense my service, clear the shot
Of all my pains, the word deny me not;
For I no greater hap desire to gain,
Than that by your consent I may proclaim
My self your servant, for so honored I
My ills received from thee may satisfy:
Speak then thou Non-such of thy sex, for why,
I Am rapt with wonder, since that thy reply
Is still protracted; let thy Organ-voyce
Pronounce some comfort, and my soul rejoice.
Do not consent (dear heart) to suffer me
With tediousness still to solicit thee:
Behold my sighs, my tears, how they express
The weakness of my might, whose edifice
So slightly's built, and by the combat rude
Which you deliver, and is still pursued,
So much is shaken, that is more apt to fall,
Then prove a Fortress to my life in thrall.
Why standst thou mute, why make you no reply?
Oh tune thy tongue, whose pleasing melody
Does far transcend the sweet harmonious strains
Of well-touch'd Lutes, composed by Musicks pains.
Perhaps you think your answer will defame
Your reputation, or your honor stain;
Or else those honey-words the which distill
From 'twixt your lips, whose Tones with Music fill
My ravished ears, at such a rate you prize,
That you believe that they will scandalize
Your spotless credit, should you let them slip
Into my ears from 'twixt your Rose-leav'd lips:
If so, take heed lest mastered with conceit,
Your self you wrong not, or too much forget:
For certainly 'twill to your shame redound,
Not to your glory, if you me confound.
Oh then Lucenda, do not strive to gain
Of cruel murdresse the abhorred name;
Do not, I prithee, for so small a price
Lose thy true servant, and his services:
What shall I say, what shall I else repeat,
To make thee certain of my pain most great?
My tongue wants words my inward griefs to show,
I want expression to declare my woe.
Sure I was borne not it to certify,
But to be certain of my misery:
Having been taught of her to grieve and plain,
Then to find ease for my afflicting pain.
Now since my will, and your excelling worth
Have not an equal measure, none of both,
Thrice Noble Lady, I Will cease to importune
Your honored self, nor yet with words presume
You to disquiet; let it then suffice
That thou have seen through prospect of thy eyes,
That if from me expected hope you banish,
My life will end, which now does pine and languish,
Then having scarcely finished these my words,
With trembling voice this answer she affords.
Lucenda to Arnalte.
THou deem'st, Arnalte, by thy cunning shift,
Thy filed talk, and this thy fancied drift
TO overcome my virtues, and my spotless fame,
Which would redound unto my utter shame:
Whioh if you hope to purchase, or inherit,
As the true Crown belonging to your merit,
In truth you will fail, for ever to obtain
What you expect, by this your course so vain.
For this I Will tell you Sir, you may conceive
What likes you best, but 'twill in fine deceive
Yonr expectations; for Sir, know you must
That in my weak defense as much I trust,
As you, in your persuasions: therefore fly
These resolutions, do no more rely
On thy strange fancies, but henceforth surcease
From thy demands, and to thy self grant peace:
This I advise thee, 'cause it will proclaim
Far more your wisdom, than if you maintain
These fond resolves; for in the least respect,
You Will never accomplish what you do project:
And that you may, Arnalte be more sure,
Know of a certain, all the Worlds great power
Cannot in sunder break the well-bar'd gate
Of the fixed purpose which I do relate.
Sail by this Land-marke, for it will address
Thee to the haven of true happiness:
Though I have daign'd at this same present time
To answer thee, why it has only been
To this intent, that having no assurance,
You might not hope, or let your suit of durance:
Since in these cases it is Speransa's kind,
Sooner than ease, prolonged delays to find:
Or if my tongue (too mild) do not express
A severe harshnesse, (for you must confess
You have deserved it, and should I inflict,
You cannot tax me, since you merit it)
In some respects, is for to favourise
Thy loyalty, observed by my eyes.
I do not question, or will I deny
But that you love me, which to testify,
Thou oftener seek'st me than I do desire;
Yet howsoever, thy pains must lose their higher:
For I pronounce your hope shall so far fly
As your request and importunity
Proves tedious to me. I no more will hear
These irksome treats, which do offend my ear:
Perhaps 'tmay be, you think, because my words
Are mild and pleasing, that my deeds 'l accord
With them in kindness; being exempted free
From rigorous strictness, or severity.
Do not still sooth your hopes, I plainly tell,
If such a thought within your breast does dwell,
'Twill not avail you ought. Arnalte know,
If your insulting love you don't of rethrow,
Or else divert its course I Will give it over
Unto some one who shall you not deplore,
But have the power justly to plain of thee,
And eke avenge, and wreake this injury.
For these same reasons, it is my wil'd-desire
You leave dispute, without delay retire:
For better it is with speed for to apply
Some saving means, some helping remedy,
Than by delays protracting, to enforce
Betwixt the soul and body a divorce:
This to advertise I did think most fit,
Since there is more loss than gain for thee in it:
Yet howsoever this my counsel laud,
And my well-wishes to the world applaud.
Be not so rashly bold, to dare to tell,
That with my speech I have not used you well.
For I declare, if such discourse you'gin,
As but to say you have abused bin,
That great ill hap shall surely thee befall,
Which I will slight, not it regard at all.
Henceforth you ought your hot desires suppress,
And curb your will, and to your self grant peace;
Which I believe you will do: for as your eyes,
Drowned up in tears your vow'd-good-will likewise,
Do manifest, and plainly show to me,
That 'twill more pleasing, and delightful be
To thee Arnalte, rather to present
Pleasures unto me, than sad discontent.
This if you slight, the love which you maintain
I shall suspect, though you it true proclaim;
And to your self it will procure but loss,
And unto me but angers vexing cross.
Now to the end that your intents may prove
Your self as prudent as your sighs you love:
And that your actions may express you thus,
To be as wise, as you are amorous:
I will no more (...) untrodden path direct
W^^^ you (...) keep your self for to protect.
Arnalte to the Traveller.
THus (...) Lucenda's answer (friend) agree
(...) correspond unto my misery:
A^^ (...) withdrew its self from lending aid,
Although with tears I her most humbly prayed:
For with dis^aine I was of her rewarded,
That pity wept to see me unregarded:
And by so much my hope did fail and cease,
By so much more desire did increase,
For hearing of her sweet mellifluous prate,
Inrich't with skill, whose tones might decorate
The heavenly Spheres, I found my self bereft
Of living motion, only it had left
My sense alive; for in that ecstasy
Though rapt I was, yet lived my memory
The which attended with great heed to prye,
If it at length some good hap might descry:
for of her well-tnn'd words it did take note,
That sweetly warbled from her silver throat.
But with her threats, her words did jointly end,
And my reward fast locked, she left behind:
For to prefer my danger, yet sad I,
Of any thing, I least did fear to dye;
The which intending she should understand,
Some days being past, the task I took in hand:
And on a night before her house my tongue
Unto her ears did chant this following Song.
The Song.
IF the afflictions which infest my heart
Must still increase, and gain no final end,
Can any one conceive the anxious smart,
Which does my heart with cruel tortures end?
Since I still living dye, yet cannot gain
Death's easing help to free me of my pain.
If all my gain in loss be comprehended,
And that my passions and heart-throbbing woes
(Although they are of wretched me be-friended)
Still prove to be my most invet'rate foes,
Why do I live, and not implore pale Death
To end my pains, by stopping of my breath?
Yet if it seem to your rare self, that I
Deserve these torments at my proper due,
Delighting still to be my enemy,
Who feels such pains as I receive from you?
For though I living dye, I cannot gain
Deaths easing help, to free me of my pain.
Perhaps the air of this sad song might keep
Lucenda waking, drive away her sleep;
Yet sure I am my plaints and sighing groans
Could not awake her heart to hear my moanes,
Nor all my vows, protests could her persuade,
Nor my laments her marble-breast invade.
Then seeing of my self to be neglected,
And that my service was of her rejected,
And that my sorrows over me did sway,
That I perforce was forced for to obey
Unto their wills; for as they waxed great,
My pores did fail, and I grew wondrous weak;
And eke my hope was troubled in such wise,
That it did cause my tender weeping eyes
To rain such showers, that I at length became
Half blind with sorrow, waxing wondrous wane,
Dissigur'd pale; and this exceeded all,
I grew so desperate, that I'gan to bawle
And rail against my wretched self, and say,
O wretched Caitiffe, where wou't thou away:
Stay hapless man, whereto art thou become?
Or to what place arrived? where wou't thou run?
Have thou yet hope, why do thou not despair?
Or see you not that from you's banished far
Redress or help? or that is impossible
To cure thy wounds, or ever make thee well?
How clearly do these signs to thee presage
Thy present loss, and future ruinage,
Since thou have reared by thy aspiring eye
Too high the Ladder of thy Loyalty?
For thou must look to fall thence sooner down,
Than mount the top, thy wishes there to crown:
Thou art the man that must more ill endure,
For thou art he who of no hap art sure;
Slave to thy self, who do abhor to live,
Yet not to wish, for thereto scope you give.
What lucklesse Planet reigned at thy Birth?
What fatal Omen was presaged on earth?
I do perceive that by degrees you waste,
And that desire will you o're-come at last.
Have not thou then great reason for to crave
That Death would lay thee in a silent grave?
Yet though you wished, or that for ease you chus't
Unto your heart, yet ought you to refus't,
Thereby to shun the loss thou must sustain,
And fly perdition which the soul may gain.
Then out I cried, I have so great a task,
I know not what to choose, to say, or ask.
Oh my forsaken soul, why do possess
A habitation so full of wretchedness?
And thou my eye, enemy to my heart,
Immortal foe, why did thou me convert
To Cupids Doctrine? Did I e're give cause
That thou should me submit to loves false Laws?
Thou were unwitting, his rewards are vain,
When his employments are too full of pain.
Yet did you know that he who truly loved,
If life he kept, from torments never moved.
Thou knew'st th'impuissance: oh to what intent
Did yield thy self unto his government?
Reply you may that you had no more power
To disobey, than I have at this hour
Will to forget her; what ills are these I see
That thus afflict, torment, and torture me?
Oh hapless man! even as thy forces fail,
So do thy sorrows over thee prevail.
For at this present by thy acts thou thought
To Enrich thy mind, but thou alas can naught:
For which attempt thou will receive great shame,
Thy life's endangered, injured is thy fame:
For these requitalls thou ought sooner grieve,
Than laud her kindness, or her praises give.
But since it is thus, let patience recompense
Thy pains, and end the war thou have commenst,
And bide the brunts the which thou do attend,
For they hereafter will more fury lend.
Though now they are easy, very light to bear,
Yet in the end continuance will out-weare
Thy soul with grief, and toil thy understanding.
If this assuage not, or be a disbanding,
Why summon reason, and appeal if she
Assist thee not, or else abandons thee.
Bewail thy cares, and open the gates then wide,
And welcome death; for at this present tide
Thou may not think to gain the remedy,
Which sense and reason unto thee deny.
Arnalte to the Traveller.
THus to my self I breathed out these laments,
And many more; but yet their sad relents
In silence I will bury, lest that I
Sold you offend through their prolixity:
But being lancht into the Sea of care,
The Galley of my passions I'gan steer
And row to Land-ward, but the raging waves
Of these my torments, like so many graves,
Were ready still for to devour me
Up in the bowels of their misery;
And coupling mischiefs with their rowlings let,
That I safe harbor in no wise could get:
Then in that stor^^^ I did of Lethe drink,
That of my used delights I did not think:
I grew so pensive, and so wondrous sad
That no delight in any thing I had;
Sorrow and care they did their service tender,
And wanton pleasure did her place surrender.
Abstain I did from the sweet company
Of my familiars, no society
With my dear friends, did I from that time keep,
I Would work enough to curse my Fate and weep.
No where I went, unless sometimes to Court,
The King to visit, (not my self to sport.)
But now my friends they had a great desire
To know the reason why I did retire,
And daily questioned and inquired to know
How I did fare; this did enforce me go
Unto the Court upon an Even-tide,
And there as soon as that the King me spied*
Having betwixt us past a Complement,
He did invite me to a Tournament,
Which by some Gallants who did often resort
His Grace to visit, some Signiors of the Court
Was enterpriz'd; and howbeit that I
Was more addicted to my privacy
Than to assemblies, yet my will to obey
I did enforce, and this to him did say,
That since his Grace vouchsaf't me to command,
I ready was, nor would his will with-stand.
Wherefore the King, he certifi'd to me
The manner often, the day when it should be:
The Term prefix't, it being well-nigh come,
That our attempts should truly then be done,
I did entreat the King for to enjoyne
All the fair Ladies who at that same time
Were resident in Thebes or the Court,
For to repair unto the Masking sport,
As well as to the Tilting, and have sight
Of the Nights Revells as the days delight:
It pleased him well, and I conceived by this,
Lucenda to invite they would not miss,
Great trouble then did my sad heart betide,
My anguishes with sudden hopes were prized;
And at that instant I was far more glad,
Than other times I was accounted sad.
The Lists being reared, and that his royal grace,
With his fair consort had possessed their place,
The Combatants, the signal given, 'gin
To rank themselves, each hoping Fame to win;
When by the Scaffold of the Queen I past,
Checking my barbed Steed, who with a grace
I caused curvete, to mount, to praunce, and leap,
And bravely vault, and such a measure keep,
That not a Dancer truer steps could trace,
Though he should traverse, hop, fall back, or chase;
For like a Kid he wantonly would skip,
Then like a Bark, or else some well-rig'd Ship
Which rides at Anchor, and does rolling lie,
He'de rise and fall, yet onward would not fly:
He springs, he leaps, then on two feet he stands,
Then on all four, then spurns about the sands;
He neighes, he foames, he puffes, he blows, he sweats,
And with his hoofes the clayie ground he beats;
Then round he runs, as he would make a ring
Composed of Horse-shoos; then his heels he flings,
Which strikes the dirt into the gazers eyes,
And makes a dust which does obscure the skies:
Stocke-still he stands, then suddenly he runs
With full carreere, then round about he turns,
And in his course he suddenly does stop,
And gently prauncing he does sideling trote*
Thus managing my Steed, I suddenly,
Through visir of my Helmet chanced to spy
Lucenda's sweet aspect, whose face contains
All rare perfections, and in her remains
Th'abstract of all beauty; oh this sight
How pleasing was it! how full of sweet delight!
Yet did I not discover the content
That I received through fortunes blandishment:
But hark me friend, and I will now declare,
And let thee know the emblem that I bear:
A balance 'twas, a scale of which was green:
The other black, a set of waights therein:
The green scale high, the black scale very low,
And on m'Impressa writ was this Motto.
How light my hope does way, you may discern*
How heavy sorrow, this to you may learn.
Through Nights approach the Tourney had an end,
Each one retires, their courses homeward bend:
The King, Queen, Ladies, they return to Court,
The Knights dis-arme themselves for other sport:
The masking hour time does usher in;
And then the Maskers they their sport begin:
Some sit and talk, some others neately trip
With measured steps, and freely dance and skip,
With those they will select, but wretched I
Afresh 'gan grieve, and wail my misery:
Since that I saw my self to have such store
Of sighs and sorrows, but in comforts poor:
Thus e'ne o're-whelmed in the sea of grief,
Merely dispairing of the least relief,
I roused my spirits, and I straight ways went
Unto Lucenda, and I did present
My service to her, treating her to glance
A gracious look, and daigne with me to dance:
To which she had not willingly con'scended,
If that the custom had not me befriended:
Then up she rose, and gave me her fair hand,
The touch whereof had power to command
A fleeting soul, to stay his hasty flight,
Thinking Elysium in her glorious sight:
Who has the skill of words for to express
The joy, sorrow, grief, and happiness
I jointly did conceive? how each did strive,
For sometimes dying, I as soon revive:
Like Tantalus I was afflicted still,
I saw my helps, but could not have my will,
Which by the vest I wore, I did express,
For on my Mancell broyder'd was this Verse,
The dying man he does exceed in grief,
Yet unkind death to kill him does deny:
Himself he lives not, and for his relief,
He seeks for death, who from him still does fly.
The Dance ended, Lucenda she retires
So nigh the Queen (crossing my desires)
That 'twas impossible to confer,
But one or other would us over-heare:
Wherefore I did resolve for to indite
A Letter to her, and in black and white
To give her knowledge of those things, which I
At that same present could not verbally:
Then to a Wardrobe I my self withdrew,
And there afresh my passions 'gan renew:
For pen and paper I Would no sooner taken,
But straight I felt my former burning flame;
Through heat of which I suffering cruel smart,
With pain I wrote the torments of my heart.
Ending my Letter, which in pleats most small
I foulded up, returning therewithal
Toward Lucenda, slily dropping down
Into the train of her embroidered Gown:
Yet this I could not act so cunningly,
But she perceived it with her rolling eye:
Yet in respect and honor of the Queen
She was constrained to pas't, as if unscene:
Th'affects of my sad missive I Will repeat,
And how my Lines in my behalf did treat.
The Letter.
HAd I, Lucenda, but such cause to right
My wronged self, as I have cause to write;
Doubtless I should my self most happy count,
And sweet delights my sorrows would surmount.
But no, alas, all wisdom, wit, or might
(By being thine) from me have taken their flight,
And left me guarded with a troop of cares,
Environed round with griefs, and grim dispaires:
So that I doubt I never shall obtain
Thy gracious favor to assuage my pain:
My words and lines have so much to thee shown,
That more to say, it is to me unknown:
There Is only this, if you my hope delay,
My speech, my life, they both will soon decay.
Alas, you may be surer of the ill
For which I grieve, lament, and mourn still,
Through my bewailings, or my brinish tears
Than by my words; for they are mixed with fears:
For whereas anguish does overcome the heart,
The eye supplies the tongue, and acts its part:
Oh wretched man, in that estat I live,
That to my self I know not what to give:
For let my faith never so lively be,
I find reward a sluggard still to me.
Yet if you think, if that you should vouchsafe
To grant me peace, (and so my life keep safe)
You should wage war against your honored fame;
Far be it from me, I do not thereat aim;
Desire I do not that you should afford,
If It be your pleasure, unto me a word:
Only vouchsafe on me to cast your eye,
For it is a kindness which will satisfy,
And recompense all ills you ever have
Conferred upon me, being of your slave.
Oh sweet Lucenda cease, give over to be
Unto my self so harsh an enemy;
For if you will that Death an end shall give
Unto my life, I have no mind to live:
Thus without trouble we may both consent,
Or much dispute, agree and be content.
But Sweet consider, if you cause me die,
You will be branded with base infamy;
And the report of your ill actions, they
Will not so lightly cease or fly away,
So long as time shall last, or fly with wings,
Or the continuance be of mortal things,
There will be mention of thy cruelty,
And of my end, caused through thy tyranny.
Oh follow Reason, and esteem thou will
That it is ill done to punish where is no guilt,
Unless you think that he does so deserve
A punishment, who does you love and serve.
In such a case its you have only might,
And I must suffer be it wrong or right.
But since you told me that you do believe
That I you love, and thereto credit give,
Why read my Letter, and then call to mind
The pain I suffer, 'cause you are unkind,
For sure I am if that my torments were
Presented to you, whispered in your ear,
You Would have more cause your rigor to repent,
Than to continu't to my detriment.
Or were the passions, which to give you have pleased,
In equal balance with my service peas'd,
Certain I am that then you would confess
To have no reason much joy to express,
Or boasting brag of the great prise you gain,
Which through my loss you winning do obtain.
But to conclude, my Letter for to end,
I do entreat that I no more may send,
But that this now may be the last; for why,
The presence's able for to verify
That which the Paper may fail to rehearse,
It wanting tears my sorrows to express:
Oh daigne to see me otherwise, I shall
Desire death to ease me out of thrall.
Arnalte to the Traveller.
M'Epistle being in the custody
Of fair Lucenda, I did long to see
How she would use't, for this intent did I
With steadfast look fix still on her my eye;
Yet could I naught perceive the which might ease
My longing thoughts, or my expectance please:
For still the doubts I had, or the mistrust
Expelled my hopes, and then obey I must.
Besides my self I was, yea, so amazed,
My friend I answer not to what he says,
But in a shivering passion I conferred,
And trembling voice which from the purpose erred.
Alas! had any but approacht, my heart
Panting for life, overcome with cruel smart,
They might have known that unkind Loves assaults
Did torture me for her offensive faults.
Now Silvered Cinthia in her spangled sphere
Began to decline, and not to shine so clear;
And Nights black Queen had almost run her race,
For she from far might spy Aurora's face,
Which gave an end unto the Mask and sport,
And every one returned home from Court:
Some in their Coaches, some on foot depart.
But I addicted rather to my smart,
Than to repose my self, I having seen
Lucenda bid goodnight unto the Queen,
In my disguised habit I did trace
Her Angell-foot-steps to her dewlling place.
Nor did I leave her there, but did aspire
To mount her Chamber, being a story higher;
And being there, I then did strive to see
What would the issue of my Letter be:
But all the while that I with her did stay,
I could not see her to my sight display
A piece of Paper. Barred of my desire,
My hope being frustrate, I did then retire:
But watchful Love, who never falls asleep,
With sundry thoughts awake did strive to keep
My drowsy self, and so he chas't away
My quiet slumbers: but as soon as Day
I saw to peep, (and that the Negro Queen
Was fled away, for fear she should be seen
Of bright Apollo, whose bright beams did shine
Through my Glasse-windows, as he 'gan to clime
Th'Easterne Hills with his fire-breathing Teeme,
Whose hoofes like Brass, or else like Gold did seem)
Unto her Mansion I my Page then sent
To make a search, but 'twas with this intent,
Only to see if he should chance to find
Some pieces of th'Embassage of my mind.
For this discovery I did him encharge
No place to leave unsought, to look at large
In every corner, with great heed to pry
In common rooms, and those of privacy.
Not to pass by the place where they did use
To cast their ordure, that of all to choose:
My Page his duty did, yet could not he
Bring any news the which might flatter me,
Or cause me hope, and so extenuate
The burning flame of my prodigious Fate.
But like to Sisyphus I roll a Stone,
And turn a whirling Wheel like Ixion:
The further still I went some help to find,
I found it absent, staying still behind,
So that I could not hide my flaming fire,
Kindled by Love, continued by Desire,
But 'twas perceived through the sweltry smoke
Of my hot sighs, which did me well-nigh choke:
And the consuming flame, by which my heart
Did suffer torments 'yond Perillus Art.
This caused me grow so wondrous solitary,
That I kept house, being of my self a weary:
But then my Sister, who Belisa hight,
In my misfortunes claimed a part, as right
Belonging to her, and with me would share,
And so a world of sorrow for me bear.
For on a day as we did both devise,
She burst out tears, which flowed from her eyes
In such abundant manner, as if all
The rainy showers had been forced to fall;
Beseeching me the cause not to conceal
Of my sad sorrow, but it to reveal.
Her plaints did move me that I was compelled
To manifest, what I would feign have held
Secret and private; yet e're I did't rehearse,
Drying her eyes these words she did express.
Belisa to Arnalte.
O Dearest Brother, for Jove's sake I pray
No longer hide thy sorrows, now display
The very truth, and satisfaction give
To my requests, and show me why you grieve:
For why so often as I have thee demanded,
Thou still found'st figmens that thy self had feigned:
Consider if the truth you do deny,
Or paliate from me the verity;
The love I bear thee, may with my regreets
Be intermixed, and so at odds be set.
That you are my debtor you your self confess,
If that I love thee, thou maintain'st no less,
Returning love for love, and mutually
In your affections make a sympathy:
Reciprocal affection you return,
To recompense my kindness so both burn
In mutual flames of that same sacred fire,
Which Jove in breasts consanguin'd does inspire.
But by your words and speech you do declaime
That which in actions you do not maintain.
You know full well that such pretenses ought
To be omitted, not to think such thoughts,
Let me entreat thee on my heart bestow
The secretary-ship of all thy woe:
For to whose trust ought you such things confide,
If not to mine, whose loyalty you have tried?
For sure you are, if you desire death,
That I do crave as soon to lose my breath.
If you fly pleasures, and abhor their sight,
Mournings please me, and therein I delight.
If care and travail you affect or love,
Rest I despise, for it does tedious prove.
Thus your afflictions, and my ills alike,
Torment one heart, with tortures on it strike.
Now if you are advised, resolved to calm
These wherling surges, safely steer the helm;
By whose assistance can you't easier do,
Than by her help, who for your hap does sue?
Your griefs t'unload, if that you daigne or please,
We Will jointly bear them, so shall you have ease.
If It be your pleasure that we wail and weep,
We Will naught else do, our eyes in tears we will steep.
Shall we each other comfort, moan your smart?
I am content, be it so with all my heart.
Will you have it hidden, or at least concealed?
We Will keep it close, it shall not be revealed.
If you desire some help for to effect,
To ease your self, I will it not neglect.
Then show not such small love to her I pray,
Whose chief observance is thee to obey.
Believe not that your slye pretenses can
O're-come my judgment, though you are a man.
Your sighs betray you, and they manifest,
What of your self you strive not to confess:
Reason does tell, that love ought not to be
Less in expression than fraternity.
Death would most pleasing be, should I my life
Lose for to ease thee, rid thee out of strife:
For I perceive thy sufferings are so strong,
The'le cut thee off, not let thee live too long.
Oh rowse thy spirits, recover strength, you will find
Fortune proves cross, unlucky, and unkind
Unto her Darlings; to the Caitiffe she is
The chiefest hope to ease his miseries,
If so unstedfast she is, so variable,
Unconstant, wherling, never still unstable,
And eke so fickle, that her Minions need
Not blaze her favors, or her noble deeds;
Never doubt her kindness, do not too much care,
Of her good will I wish you not despair.
Her wheel still turns, and daily she imparts
Some accidents to one or others hearts.
The saddest many you know does mitigate
His vexing sorrow, if he do it relate
Unto his friend; for through the recreation
Of words, oft-times torments lose their station*
Sorrow does inward swell if but concealed,
But if disclosed, it may perhaps be healed:
Thus if the Keys of these my counsels may
Unlock thy helps, and thereto make thee way,
Refuse them not; or do you take delight
On your afflictions to think day and night,
Your precious time wastfully expending
By parlying to your self, yet no good tending?
I know (believe me) that the hidden flame
Which you reveal not, it does but inflame
Thy soul with torments, and that obscured fire
Does burn thy heart with coals of hot desire:
Whereas the sorrows which you did express,
Through utterment their pain is grown more less*
In what degree thy torments be, or are,
In their concealment there is more danger far
Than to detect them, 'specially to me,
Who in my heart do bear and owe to thee
More love and friendship than my tongue can show,
Or words express, or thoughts conceive to knew.
Now fearing least that I too far presume,
I Will at this present cease to importune
Thee with my treaties, leave off my requests,
And end discourse, and to my words give rest.
Arnalte to Belisa.
MY sister pausing, I did this reply:
Thy passion sister moves me to comply
Unto thy will, and forces me declare,
What by my gesture does most plain appear:
But I am urged, more through thy earnestness,
Than my own will, to answer thy requests.
Had I not seen these thy unfaigned tears,
Thou never had heard this answer with thy ears:
Yet e're I ought relate, I thee entreat,
When as my tongue my sufferings shall repeat,
Not to disturb thy self; for sooner I,
Then leave my purpose, am resolved to dye.
Then thus it is, my self I do not know
By what strange means, but I was forced to bow,
And yield my self to Loves all-conquering Laws,
Without provisoes, or a helping clause;
To which my fortune has me so confined,
That naught but trouble I do daily find:
For my sad heart's besieged, environed round
With many torments, who would me confound.
A thousand sobs guard my distressed heart,
As many sighs their vexing aid impart:
Millions of woes, like bands of armed Knights,
Stop up the passage of my sweet delights;
Which siege still dures, and in that cruel wise,
That all th'opposement that I can devise,
Whether in mining with my deepest thoughts,
Or climbing Ladders by aspiring wrought,
Cannot obtain a wished for victory.
For love opposes, proves an enemy
Unto my fortune, who does faintly strive
Against th'incounters, which love fiercely drives.
Oh thus it is, if death do not lend succor,
Too late 'twill be, if else where I't recover:
Why then, dear sister, do not grieve I pray,
Or vex thy self, though sorrow should me slay,
But rather joy, since thou have a brother,
Who can his sorrows, and his torments smother.
If ought thou wilt do wherewith thou will me pleasure,
Dry up those tears, which trickle out of measure
Along thy cheeks, bedewing thy fair face,
Where love and beauty sit with equal grace:
If tears would help me, I Would alone deplore,
I need no partner, for of tears I Have store.
But since these watery streams, which overflow
Like rising Nilus, cause but passion grow;
Far better it is to let thy Sluices down,
And stop their fury, least they do thee drown.
Two different Planets reigned at our births,
Mine prophes'd sorrow, thine presaged mirth:
For all the pleasure that I Would seek or choose,
I Would turn it over to thy proper use,
'Cause justly it to thee does appertain;
For care and travail, I do naught else claim,
And can more stoutly bear them and resist
Them manfully, and spite their force subsist
With far more vigor than thou can express;
For in thy heart there is no room to rest
Or harbor such afflictions, be content
For these my reasons, and I pray consent
That we may live, my self in sad distress,
And thou in joy and true happiness.
If this you contradict, or else oppose,
I shall believe that you profess but shows,
Not wishing me the good you do express,
Since to my will you prove to be adverse:
Doubling my woes, causing my pain to thrive
Through thy bewailings: oh practice, learn, strive
To overcome thy sorrow, cease henceforth to grieve,
Or moan the pain wherein I tortured live,
Else shall I have more cause for to lament,
Feeling more sorrow linkt with discontent.
My Sister seeing that no otherwise
I her requests did answer satisfice,
Did then intend not to solicit more
To know the reason why I did deplore:
But cunningly resolved for to find
The sad effects of my disturbed mind,
And to search out with slye subtilties
The hidden Spring from whence my pains did rise*
For endless woes did still associate me,
And vexing sorrows kept me company.
My Sister then she was no sooner gone,
But I gave way to let my grief come on
More freely then I ever did before,
Which I did cherish daily more and more:
What anguishes, what torments did acquaint
M'afflicted heart which did through sorrow faint
With their hard usage, and their cruel power,
Turning my sweet into a bitter sower!
During the which I never could take my rest.
I was borne wretched, and did live oppressed;
But being got on sorrows highest staire,
Arrived at the period of despair,
I then remembered how on a certain time
I had revealed unto a friend of mine,
(A Gentleman, and my familiar mate)
The love I bear Lucenda, and the state
Wherein I lived, and how that he did strive
That loving humor from my mind to drive:
For which occasion since I had not been
To show my mind, or else to speak with him,
Weighing the danger that might so arise,
For well I knew in such necessities
And weighty matters, if a man disclose
His secret thoughts (although he do suppose
It Is to his friend) he may the hazard run,
His hope to frustrate, and so overturne
His expectation; for through secrecy
The Lover's crowned with true felicity.
Yet ne'rethelesse casting these doubts aside,
I did conclude once more for to unhide
To him of whom I speak all my affections,
Hoping he would pity give me some directions.
What me emboldned, was because that he
Next neighbor was unto Lucenda she:
Were I lodged where this my friend did dwell,
I then might see and please my eyesight well:
For which intent I sent to pray him come
To visit me, which straight of him was done.
Then at's arrival, I the cause did show
For which I caused him come, and let him know
The confidence and trust I did repose
In him my friend, these secrets to disclose.
For this he thank't me very lovingly;
And whereas he before did often try
For to divert me from my fixed intent,
My mind to alter, which to love was bent,
He now gave notice that he did approve
To lend me succor to obtain my love:
Which to effect, more pity to infuse
Within his breast, these words I then did use,
Arnalte to Yerso.
YErso, my faithful truest friend, if I
At this same present unto the discry
Perspicuously the things which till this time
In clouds of silence have obscured been,
It is thy virtue, and the confidence
I have of thee that moves me to commence't:
Be not displeased, nor take it ill in part,
That I so long have lingered to impart;
For well you know that Silence is esteemed
In Cupids Palace, and unwise he is deemed
Who blabs Loves secrets: this then wrought in me
A thousand thoughts, which your benignity
Has chaste away; and now (dear friend) at length
I feel my anguish to abate its strength;
Since thus it is, where may I better rest
My secret thoughts than in thy noble breast;
Since that thy virtue and thy amity
Are both agreed, to guard them carefully.
Then friend and brother, I to thee declare,
Against life and death I wage a tedious war;
Death I encounter, 'cause he will not obey,
Life I oppose, 'cause she stands in my way.
This cruel conflict it began, when as
Lucenda's father from this life did pass:
Then first I saw her, and since that time
Continued without means for to combine
A friendly peace or truce, for love seeing
Me so submisse, my chiefest practice being
In due observance of her strict commands,
Or true performance of her ask't demands:
With all his might wounded my (love-sicke) heart
With burning Shafts, and hot impoyson'd darts,
So that his Combat being wondrous rude,
And my resistance weak, I was pursued
Even unto death; for his assaults have been
Without cessation, or a finishing:
And my defense unto so poor an end,
That those who should have been my truest friends,
They have betrayed me, and forsaken me,
To shroud themselves in more security;
For hope renounced me, help did from me fly,
Reason she shunned me, succor came not nigh.
Now if you think, because I this propound,
That in my wits I am not well, or sound,
Believe me ( Yerso) I should so possess,
Had I no sense, a real happiness.
Were I unwitting of my overthrow,
I for my loss should feel no pain or woe;
Were I of wit and reason both bereaved,
I should not fear or questioned to be healed:
And so not hoping, I should not despair
Of ease, or help, for which I now do care.
Thus dearest friend, thou see what that I am,
How to my self no safeguard lend I can,
Unless the Bands of thy most kind affections,
And armed troops of thy well-wisht directions
Do me assist, and undertake to guard
My wretched heart, which from all help is barred.
Upon a means I Have thought, which to effect
To sweet content may truly me direct.
For since thy lodging does so near adjoyne
Unto Lucendas, whose sweet looks enjoyne
My dazel'd sight her aspect to behold,
(Which shames Apollo though he shine like Gold)
I crave dear friend that thou will suffer me
For to inhabit some few Months with thee.
For all the joy and the bliss I crave,
Is but a prospect of her face to have:
Then I entreat thee that thou wilt not deny
To lend me help my mind to satisfy;
For, for this purpose I have for thee sent,
That being acquainted with my fixed intent,
Thou might assist me, I implore thy aid:
For thou a means of great god Love were made.
And cause I credit you have more desire
For to befriend me than I can require,
I Will cease to parley, or to urge you more,
And end my suite, and my requests give over.
Answer of Yerso to Arnalte.
OF thee, and to thee Arnalte I complain,
Since in your breast you harbor and retain
Doubt and suspicion, with the fiend distrust,
And that of me more-o're tax you I must,
Since you transgress the limits of affection,
Seeking strange ways, and not your friends protection.
Ill done it was so long for to obscure,
Or hide from me the ills you do endure:
Put case it is thus, that Loves ordained Laws
Bind you to silence, not to blab your cause;
You may be pitty'd, but no way relieved,
If you conceal your pain, you being grieved:
For it is a Maxim, and most true indeed,
"Who spare to ask, must likewise spare to speed.
Thou may, Arnalte, this thy self assure,
The grief of thy afflictions will endure
More constant with me than my words to plain,
Or to condole thy sorrows and thy pain.
But could thy torments but divided be,
I Would be a partner in thy misery:
Yet what in actions cannot be expressed,
Shall be accomplished through my willingness.
Thou do declare, that in the splendent eyes
Of bright Lucenda treason hidden lies,
Which traitorously thy life does overthrow,
From those fair eyes my cares do likewise grow:
For if in thee she moves afflicting passion,
My life she ruins with a strange destruction.
Yet to the end our wills may both accord,
(Free from discordance, of true friends abhorred)
From this day forward I will banish quite
The thought of her who used me to delight:
Assuring you that I Will conclude a peace
To pleasure thee, and cause my war to cease,
Though it do grieve me very vehemently,
I Will it effect to gain my liberty,
And turn thee over to the bondage which
Thou do desire, satisfy thy wish;
And that the rather, 'cause I will secure
My liberty, for of no hap I Am sure;
By my retreat I shall infranchis'd be,
And you will remain still in captivity.
Thou pray'st me also that I Would thee advise,
Receive thy plaints, and listen to thy cries:
If from my counsel could such profit grow,
As flowing tears from thy sad sorrows, know
Thou should be healed straight, exempted free
From ill or pain, or any misery.
But let me'tell thee, I am rapt with wonder,
That thou would be vanquished, and by force brought under
The cruel bondage of so weak a foe,
Who will usurp, and you must duty owe.
And thou (brave spirit) who art memoriz'd
For thy great acts above the lofty skies,
Thou art enthralled, alas, now confined
Unto the will of a weak woman's mind,
Oh call to mind how thy bright shining fame
Will be ecclipsed, if thou do this same,
And thy rare worth, how will it blasted be
With the report of shameful infamy?
Fly these abuses, and courageously
Resist fond love with valor manfully.
Nor say I this because I would dehort
Thee from thy purpose, or at least exhort
Thee not to love; for I would have thee dare
To cherish it, but with a pallid fear:
And seeking shun it, wish, yet not crave,
For to enjoy what you do wish to have.
Or would I have thee all at once expel
Love from thy heart, (affections chiefest cell)
For then thou would as great a hazard run,
As it appears thou have already done
Through thy consentment: since thou do obey
To love false soothings, or his flattering lay.
Love is a cheater, he pretends most fair,
In stead of hap he will leave you naught but care:
Who loves him least, and does him most neglect,
His Laws reward him with a due respect.
I am persuaded you'de do wondrous well,
Should you repeat, and plainly to him tell
The baseness of his deeds, how shameless he
Abuses thee through his base treachery.
Let no despair too much with thee reside,
And have a care how you do love confide.
Consider Hope, how it is her condition,
Though things seem easy, not to grant fruition:
Regard how Fortune, though she be unstable,
Gives end to things unstedfast, variable:
And thus Lucenda, Authresse of thy woe,
In time she may some pity to thee show,
And please thy senses, with her Organ voice
Revive thy spirits, and thy heart rejoice:
Now if you will advised by me be,
Thou shall obtain what seems hard to thee.
Come to my house, use it, oh do not stand
On terms I pray, it is at your command:
Thou have me injured, having all this time
Delayed it, thou knowing I am thine:
But 'cause hence-forward I Will more careful be
To cure thy wounds, applying remedy,
Than to prove tedious with my words or talk,
I Will silent be: and now wilt please you walk?
Arnalte to the Traveller.
THus friend you have heard the answer Yerso made,
But when he plaind of this sweet virtuous maid,
Renowned Lucenda, I began to swell,
Being impoyson'd with a fiend of Hell.
Suspicion scorcht me, raging jealousy
Did burn my heart, which in hot flames did fry:
But howsoever I made no outward show,
How that the fire inwardly did glow:
For I conjectured that these fantasies
From too much love and fondness did arise.
Sometimes I doubt him, which being scarcely thought,
Those thoughts I banish, set them all at naught,
And then I way his kindness, and his proffer:
Our ancient friendship, how he near did offer
The least unkindnesse, and I then embrace,
To make his house my dwelling for a space.
The giddy Moon did scarcely three times run
Her mighty course, or has the glorious Sun
(With fiery Steeds, and flaming Chariot hurled)
Thrice bid good morrow to the nether world,
Whilst here I so journ'd; but I straight perceived
I was defrauded, and, alas, deceived:
For though I watched, or heedfully did look,
I could not see her, though this pains I took.
Thus worse and worse my pains did daily grow,
And in so many kinds I did it show,
That diverse people did thereof take note,
That variously they did of it report,
And that so public, that my sister dear,
The kind Belisa, came of it to hear;
And she considering of my present pain,
And future ills I might at length sustain,
With care endeavored, adding all her skill,
To find the reason of my grieving ill.
Through her entreaties she did so much learn,
That she did see, perceive, and eke discern,
That all my woes and pains they did arise
From the fair fountains of the Crystal eyes
Of sweet Lucenda; thus resolved, she speeds
To find her out which caused my heart to bleed,
Alt'ring her course of life, striving to be
Far more familiar than she wont to be
With Dame Lucenda, though long since 'twixt them
Love and affection had conversant been,
The days great King, bright-ey'd Hiperion,
In golden triumph brightly shining run
His wonted Progress over and over again,
Himself to bathe in the cool Western Maine,
E're that my sister could gain swift-wing'd time
To be propitious unto her design.
But on a day, about the time which we
Call the Maridian, when the Sun we see
With hottest rays, and fiery breath to clime
Th'Ecclipticke Pole, my sister then did dine
With fair Lucenda, and then dinner past,
She did retire with her welcome guest
To a withdrawing room, there to repose,
Where when they were my sister this disclosed.
Belisa to Lucenda.
COurteous Lucenda, virtues chiefest heir,
Our Sexes glory, for there is none so fair:
Oh let thy goodness as transparent be,
As those bright beams which in your eyes we see:
Thy wonted prudence and thy wisdom use,
Be not offended, all distaste refuse;
Oh tax me not, although I should offend
Thee with my words, my dearest, dearest friend.
Dear tax me not of indiscretion,
For any word the which my trembling tongue
Shall utter to thee, if you apprehend
Aright my meaning, I shall be esteemed
And praised, I hope rather, then to be told
That I presume, offend, or am too bold:
And that the rather, 'cause another grief
Emboldneth me to plead for his relief.
Give ear Lucenda, and you then shall know,
That it is long since that sorrow, pain, and woe
Thrives with my brother, and the sacred Lamp
Of his rich health, burns smothering in a dampe:
So that all help which we to him apply
Effects no cure, it proves contrary.
Now knowing this, and seeing that the date
Of his sick life was e'ne exterminate
Through vehement pain, and cruel killing smart,
Which rents his breast, and tears in two his heart;
Him I besought with sighs, and tears, and cries,
For to reveal, discover to my eyes
His hidden passions, which did e'ne exhale
His fainting breath (to puff up Charons sail)
But all I did could not, alack, prevail;
He still was silent, though I weep or wail.
But I at length through slye suspicion found,
Of all his cares the true and perfect ground:
And still inquiring, I did find this out,
(Conjecture, aiding, and distrustful doubt)
That thou the motive art which does atract
His dying heart, with blind loves torments rackt:
And eke the means consists friend in thee
To heal his pain, release, and set him free.
Now to assure your self that all is true
Which I express, declare, and tell to you,
No other proof you need, but the complaints
I move, of him whose soul with sorrow faints.
Had I not seen the dangerous storm wherein
His life's nigh ship-wrack't, I would not have bin
So unadvised rash, for to complain
Of the afflictions which he does sustain.
A great desire I moreover have
To do him service, and his life to save;
For if my will resist, why straight I find
His sad disasters to divert my mind,
And my true love, and unfeigned affection,
If that I err grants me a true direction:
And this I vow, could but my life release
Him from afflictions, to his heart give ease,
I Would not respect it, I would lay it down,
His wounded heart with future bliss to crown.
You know the fruit the last Plague did us yield,
How Charon wafted to the Elisian fields
Our honored Parents; will you likewise act
A Tragedy as grievous, and as black,
As full of horror, to the utter ruin
Of all our Lineage, and our house undoing?
Yet if so cruel you your self express,
You will receive small praise, you must confess.
Avouch I can, and this affirm indeed,
If you deny to help him now in need,
Care-freeing death will to his pain give rest,
And ease his life, which now is but oppressed.
Consider but how deeply you are bound
Unto his love, which is most pure and sound:
For though you him disdain, his suit neglect,
Still, still he loves you, owes you all respect.
And since to him these toylesome labors seem
Full of delight, and care he quiet deemes,
For there is not any one so well acquainted
With your Conditions, with unkindnesse tainted.
You are beholding, in a high degree,
Unto his faithful love and constancy.
Nor is this all, for it does plain appear
He does respect your honor, truly fear
To tax your worth, for he with pleasure fain's
To undergo his sorrows and his pains:
And though his bnrthen might fit Atlas back*
With constancy he bears the heavy pack.
Then do not daigne to let such loyalty
To fail or perish, unrewarded dye;
Which if you suffer, then the Sisters three,
The Goddesses of Mortals destinies,
They Will cut his thread, and so he will end his days
To your dishonor, his never dying praise:
Since now you may dis-ranke the mighty bands
Of his strong passions, quench the fiery brands
Of burning love, if only you will daigne
To send some Lines, subscribed with your name;
For Loves sake grant it, and you then shall have
Of me your friend a most submissive slave.
Lucenda to Belisa.
Dear friend Belisa, let not any doubt
Possess thy thoughts, suspicion banish out;
Nor do not think that thou shall taxed be
For any thing thou have revealed to me:
Nor is thy honor blemish't, or thy fame
So much as spotted with asmutch or stain:
It is as pure as the Pirenian snow,
As bright as Lillies in their milke-white shows.
This to affirm, I my Conscience call,
And thy renown well known in general.
Put case y'ad wronged me with your passed words,
Your bashfulnesse and modesty affords
As soon redress; thus you ought rather mourn
For your dear brother, with affliction torn,
Than to excuse the fault that is not committed,
But it is your goodness, and you ought be pitty'd.
Oh how it grieves me that my answer cannot
Yield thee no comfort, or wished so lace grant!
I make no question of thy brothers pain,
And less I wonder that for him you plain.
Now if he will, what you do say he will,
That is, consent my mind for to fulfill,
Himself shall act it, but provided this,
That to my worth it no dishonor is:
For I as much my honor must respect,
As you his life; (nor I his life neglect)
For well you know, if Ladies do consent
Unto th'allurings, and the blandishment
Of sighing Lovers, then their fame will be
Eclipsed in Clouds of shameful infamy.
Oh do not crave that I should act that which!
Your self would shun: (our honors prejudice)
Are you unwitting of the sacred light
Of my pure virtues, would grow dark as night,
Should I inflame with my pure Virgin fire
The waxen Taper of the hot desire
Of thy dear brother? would to God that this
Thou had not mentioned, since so grave it is.
Alas, alas, how oftentimes have I
Wished this my beauty were deformity?
How often have I, when I have been alone,
Bewayld his tears with tears, and moan'd his moan?
Since that his thoughts do mount, and aim so high,
That they e'ne reach impossibility,
As great a mind I have, as much desire
Him to assist, as you have to require:
And if that ought his safety could procure,
My Fame exempted, I would it endure:
But since my loss must prove to be his gain,
I cannot help him, would I never so feign.
This let him know, as also that I grieve
For his hard chance, yet cannot him relieve,
Now if my answer do not satisfy
Thy expectations, do not tax me, why?
There is no fault in me, my honor blame;
For could I help him I would do the same.
Oh tax me not Belisa of ill will:
Nor do thou blame me, I have done no ill.
Arnalte to the Traveller.
WIth quick return my sister to me came
From fair Lucenda (whose transcendent name
I ever honor) this she certifi'd;
But yet her answer she from me did hide,
Thinking at length to imprint into my mind
That for my good, which now did prove unkind.
Yet all her words they could me not persuade,
Nor would I credit ought, though it did invade
My pensive breast; for what my sister told,
'Twas ambiguous, 'surance did not hold
League with her fictions; for if the effect
Proves false or feigned, it cannot truth direct.
These sundry reasons moved me to suppose
My sister had not gained what she prepos'd.
Then sad despair did straight possess my breast,
And expelled hope of any help or rest:
Thus destitute of any means to ease,
M'afflicted mind, or sorrows to appease,
I did resolve to feign, as if at naught
I prized Lucenda, not to cherish thought
Of her perfections; for I notice had
She careless was, and void of all regard
Concerning my afflictions; m' unkind Fate
She did not tax, or once compassionate.
But to the purpose, my resolved intent
I executed, made experiment,
Praying my sister for to certify
Unto Lucenda, that hence-forward I
Would take less pains, my self for to confine
Unto her service, though she seemed Divine.
And that hereafter I would learn to live
Like to my self, and not my freedom give
Unto a Lady, who did disregard
My life and love, and gave me no reward:
My sister said a word she would not miss,
Yet e're she went I her advised this,
That she should mark, and with a curious eye
Observe the blushes of her Phismony:
And above all, when that she should declare
Her message to her, then to have a care
For to behold the looks which she should glance,
With the mutations of her countenance:
For by the gesture one may sooner find,
Than by the words the meaning of the mind;
And by the color that does come and go,
The hearts intentions one may plainly know.
As also to regard when she should cease,
If that Lucenda too should hold her peace;
Or else make show as if she did not care
For all the love or honor I her bear:
And if she should respond whether it were
Sudden or doubtful, uttered with a fear:
For hard it is such things for to obscure,
If love be perfect, or affection pure.
Now did my sister, having understood
My will and pleasure, write in lines of blood
Within her heart, and lodged in her mind,
What I had told her, and then went to find
Virtuous Lucenda; who when sh'ad found,
The place consenting, this she did propound.
Belisa to Lucenda.
IF my requests have caused as much distaste
To thee Lucenda, as I am shame-fac't
TO entreat them of thee, then I marvel much
Your clemency and goodness should be such
As to regard me, and most graciously
For to forgive so great an injury;
Yet howsoever it is so ordained,
That the harsh torments of the Captive, and
My loving brother, moove and cause in thee,
Unquiet anger, and disturbers be
Of thy sweet thoughts, and my earnest suing
As irksome to thee as my brothers woing.
The love I bear him it compelling me,
And trusting in thy virtuous courtesy,
I have presumed my self for to present
Before thy face with his sad strained laments.
Hear then I pray thee, and with me bear part,
Since without them I live without a heart.
Lucenda know my brother does intend
No more to love thee, but to give an end
Unto those thoughts, that he himself may free
From servitude, and gain his liberty:
Although the beauty and the lovely grace,
With the perfections of thy pleasing face,
Have fettered him in chains of wilful love,
And strongly bound him that he scarce can move:
Yet he does say he will do it, and forsake
His Country too, and then his absence make
An Arbitrator 'twixt thy cruelty
And his true love, and constant loyalty:
And thus exiled he does hope to find
What you deny him, being still unkind.
But if you do permit, or else consent
To let him act this his resolved intent,
Long after him I shall not live, but dye;
For after death my soul with his must fly.
If he himself absent he cannot live,
And I alone; who shall me comfort give?
And so forsaken, living desolate,
Death will my light with speed extenuate:
And thus shall I as disrespected be,
As if I were thy mortal enemy.
You take more pains for to seem merciful,
Than really for to be pitiful:
For you reject the faithful constancy
Of your true friend, who does continually
Wish you more good than any living wight
Can optate for you, to your sweet delight.
Yet not withstanding has it ever been
Heard of, or known, or at least wise seen,
That any one did ever gratify
Such generous actions with discourtesie?
Wou't have his mind be whole, his will be sound
When thou his heart with torments do confound?
Let me entreat thee, (nay for love of me)
New Laws establish, and henceforth decree
Other Injunctions to thy resolved will,
And with unkindnesse do not thou him kill.
Nor speak I this to incite thee to transgress
The bounded limits of thy vertuousnesse:
But if you act what I to you propound,
It to your praise and glory will redound:
Since through your pity you may save, relieve
Two dying bodies, and their lives reprieve.
Oh say not nay (dear friend) to my requests,
Since that thy honor shall not be molest:
Revolve unto thy self what will become
Of my dear brother, if he abandon
Thy company; and what will eke betide*
To me (he absent) when alone I bide?
Take heed least you cause him precipitate,
And my sad sorrow do not exasperate.
Oh call to mind, alas, do not forget
His grief, my anguish, sweet now pity it:
For Jove's dread sake be not so obstinate,
Selfe-wil'd, resolved, or so opinionate:
Oppose thy will, but spotless, without stain
Unto thy honor, or thy virtuous fame:
So shall you served be, honored, and I
Have consolation in my misery.
Oh be not guilty of his overthrow,
Nor causer of my cruell-killing woe:
Strive to overcome the passion of thy will,
Withstand its rage, the fury of it kill:
For all things governed by the wills direction
Come home with loss, and not with gains protection.
With my entreaties be not thou offended,
But let me thus far be of thee befriended,
That thou will daigne some lines to recommend
Unto my brother, and that to this end,
That the bright Taper of his living light
Be not snuft out, and so his day made night:
For it is against all reason, Law, or sense,
To punish him who has done no offense.
Lucenda to Belisa.
Dry up thy tears Belisa, weep no more,
Assuage thy passions, and thy grieve give over,
For from this day I will conformed be
Unto your will, and grant what you decree.
Now would to God that I had not a tongue,
Then with my words my self I should not wrong:
And although the fault already is transgrest,
Too credulous, my self I have expressed.
Yet could I not withstand it, since thou will
Take to thy self the blame of all my guilt;
Thy self oblieging for to set me free,
Clad in white robes of pure innocence.
Oh do not bragging boast, or boasting vaunt
Of what thy treaties have enforced me grant:
The trickling tears which from thy eyes did run,
Like armed troops, my will have overcome:
Yet notwithstanding I delight do take
In my displeasure, since it recreates
Thy pensive thoughts, and my affection's such,
That ought for thee I cannot think too much:
For if my loss thy gain may prove to be,
I do desire to suffer it for thee;
Entreating thee to grant me so much love
As to obtain it, you have treaties moved
Not presently to vilify; neglect
The prize obtained with base disrespect:
For it is a rule well known in general,
Most common too, and kindly unto all;
That things not purchac'd we do highly prize,
But once obtained we do them then despise,
Remember well, that from this present tide,
You reduable are to me oblieg'd.
The longest day you live do not forget
The recompense to countervaile this debt.
Consider how at this same present time
My honors thread I do untwist, untwine:
Yet since I have my self thus hazarded
To write unto him, I will have no dread,
With this proviso, that my Letter give
Peace to his war, quietly cause him live.
Oh would to God 't had been his sacred will,
That at that time when I my heart did fill
With the sad thought of this determination,
(Embracing sorrow with deliberation)
That then the earth had gaped, and swallowed me
Up in her bowels of obscurity;
For then had I been eased by pale-faced death
Of that which now will last whilst I have breath:
My soul must suffer't, since commiseration
Has enterpriz'd against its self this action.
And though Belisa I do now repent
Me of these things to which I do consent,
Yet have I not the power to revoke
What I do grant, because I would provoke
Some joy to thee, also to intermixe
Mirth with the sorrow, in thy true heart fixed.
Therefore will I give way that thy request
Shall take possession of my pensive breast:
And to the end that thou may have a sight
Of my pen'd-missive, I Will begin to write.
A Letter of Lucenda to Arnalte.
I Do believe my Letter will not find
Thee, friend Arnalte, glader in thy mind,
Than sad it left me; yet for to complain
I Would had no cause, had but my hand been lame,
Or else benumbed, at that same instant, when
It did touch paper with the well-nib pen,
To write this missive, since it captives me,
Thralling my freedom and my liberty;
Giving to thee that which I never thought,
A gage too precious, where it owed thee naught*
Be not too proud, 'cause unto thee I write,
Nor yet too sad, if henceforth to thy sight
M' Epistles come not; let reason mitigate
Thy present glory, and my missive take.
With shows well-tempered give it entertain,
With wise expressions; do not thou proclaim
Thy inward joy, hide it, and disguise
Thy vehement love from all observing eyes.
Remember well when as such victories
Are published, that men then sacrifice
Ladies bright honors, but since friend so well
What Is needful for thee thou thy self can tell:
Be not less heedfull those things to direct,
Which may assist me, or my fame protect:
Still have before thy eyes, never forget,
How thee to pleasure I my self neglect,
Changing my Title: I who used to have
Respect and honor, am become a slave,
To favor thee, for I have hazarded
My reputation, and a discord bred
Within my self: for at that instant when
You chant your glory, very, very then
I wail and weep, since I thee to content,
Suffer great loss unto my detriment,
Staining my honor, spotting of my fame
With base aspersions, blasting of my name.
How often have I with-drawne my trembling hand
From off this paper, and gi'n strict command
Unto my pen not one word more to write?
Ah, but alas, who has the strength or might
For to withstand thy importunities,
Or ward themselves from thy persuading cries?
Thou have gained rest unto thy labor now:
For doubt assurance, and moreover thou
Have cause to glory, and thy self to glad,
Since no occasions left to make thee sad.
Thy sister tells me thou will hence depart:
I thee assure 't would grieve me to the heart:
For those who cannot any help express,
Ought not direct men unto sad distress.
To tell the truth, I rather do mistrust
This is deceit, than real, true, or just:
Yet to deceive me if you did intend,
I do declare that thou have gained thy end.
But howsoever, I would have you know
I understood it, though I made no show;
And to the end you thinking to beguile
Or circumvent me, you be not the while
O're-reacht, defrauded; for full well I know,
That amongst ye, who love, do duty owe:
When that by wiles you to the period come
Of your designs, and slily overcome
Us female Creatures, think ye have achieved
A victory most highly to be prized.
Deem not thy self so subtle, nor think me
So indiscreet, or simple for to be:
But that I have perceived it in that kind,
That more for pity of thy vexed mind,
Than dread of thee, these few lines I do write,
What you endure your sister does recite.
For she does so assure me of thy pain,
And with her tear likewise aver the same;
That not alone I thereto credit give:
For, for thy sufferings I both mourn and grieve,
And in that wise that I would let thee know it
By this my Letter which does plainly shew't.
Let this content thee, or else otherwise
You may lose that which you have made your prize:
Comfort thy self, and so thy self retire
Into thy self, never more aspire
To find me out with toylesome labor, why,
Your long discourse, and the small time that I
Can spare to hear it, will exasperate
Afresh your sorrows, and them aggravate.
Arnalte to the Traveller.
SHe having this her Letter finished,
She gav't my sister, who with swift-wing'd speed
Made haste to find me, being at that tide
Into my Closet for a while retired:
But when I saw her, I did by her gesture,
What she did speak; e're she it spoke conjecture.
Then drawing nigh me, she began to tell
I should not mourn, but my cares expel:
For she did bring me what Lucenda had
Concluded of them, thus bid me be glad.
Wherefore she 'gan for to recite at last,
What 'twixt Lucenda and her self had past;
And from her bosom she drew forth the Letter,
Which did reprieve my life, and made me debtor
Still unto death; then holding 't in my hand,
I did along while pausing with it stand.
Nor could I be persuaded it could be,
That such good hap should happen unto me.
Then kissing sweetly with a true respect
That blessed Paper, and the snow-white neck,
And Swan-like hands of my most dearest sister,
I broke it open having often kissed her:
And then I read it, but who then had seen
Me, would have judged I had surprised been
With sweet delight, and easily have sed
That pleasing pleasure had me ravished.
The virtue of that Letter did inflame
More bright my fire, and I deemed the same
Beyond esteem, and with excess of joy,
My soul was rapt in such an ecstasy,
That it well nigh my body did forsake,
For to give way that it more room might make
For these new joys, and to entertain
Delight and pleasure in liew of my pain.
But having read it, and re-read it, I
Then found contentment and alacrity;
Not too predominate, for grim despair
As well as joy, claimed an equal share:
For when I thought my drooping self to glad,
I lost my courage, for no hope I had.
And if I would lament, why the good will
Which she professed me, did oppose me still:
So what to do, alas I could not tell,
My counsel left me, doubt did with me dwell.
But 'cause my griefs were far more vehement
Than all the joy, or the sweet content
Her Letter brought me, I did then indite
This answer to her, which I thus recite.
The Letter of Arnalte to Lucenda.
THose well-pen'd Lines that were composed by thee,
Divine Lucenda, and addressed to me,
I have received, but I must confess
With more content than now I can express;
For when they were presented to me, then
I deemed my self the happiest of men:
But when I read them sorrow did affright
All joy from me, and all sweet delight:
For being closed they promised me redress,
But being opened, nothing else expressed,
Unless unkindnesse, which did overthrow
My expectations, throb my heart with woe,
By which I judge there is more likelihood
For future ills than for my present good:
So that I cannot really express
Such true delight as I ought to confess;
For if I think thy favor to obtain,
My torments thrive, and I grow rich in pain:
For by your writing you do quite destroy
All hope of comfort, or delight some joy.
My ills you say do grieve you, wherefore then
Do you express that which you do not mean?
Why do you publish, or with words proclaim,
What with your will you mean not to maintain?
If so it were, that my afflictions they
Displeasing were, then might you truly say
What you maintained; and then you would retract
What you commit now both in word and fact.
Ah dear Lucenda, why do you pretend
Not truly with your truly loving friend.
I have the name, but you commit the act;
I gain the honor, you express the fact.
Truly I Would rather that my sufferings were
Doubtful unto thee, than that thou should bear
Credit unto them, giving no redress
Unto my torments, or my wretchedness.
You do propose, dear love, to me that I
Should Court your favors very modestly:
If I could ease my self so freely well
As I can bear my Sorrows, let me tell
Thee, dearest Mistress, I would never groan
Under the burden of my grief or moan;
My smarting pain with speed I would recure,
These grievous torments which I do endure.
Now if you please (fair love) to succor me,
Or to allay my killing misery,
Let me entreat thee (Sweetest) not to daigne
Despair a triumph over my Soul to gain:
Neither permit grim Death to bathe his Dart
Within the crimson river of my heart:
Let it suffice that thou have robbed me
Of the best part of life; sweet Lady see
How that my tears entreat thee for thy grace,
Which if you grant not, death will come in place;
For why, my sorrows which do parallel
Thy heavenly beauty, which does all excel,
The are too heavy and insufferable,
I cannot bear them the are intolerable.
This is the cause, I feeling of my Fate,
And how unkindly you it aggravate;
That I cannot rejoice, or dure to see
Another glader than my self to be:
For I do wish that every one were used
With love as basely as I am abused:
And since my love does daily still increase,
And that reward does grant me no release,
I do resolve unto some place to go,
Never to return; for this I Will let thee know,
That Death and Time in this my banishment,
Shall ease my cares, and kill sad languishment.
Now since you have bard up all hope from me,
Of speaking to thee, yet vouch safe to see
Me e're I part; nor speak I this t'impaire
Thy bright renown, as glorious and as fair
As Phoebus Rays, for let it not (sweet) be
In any place debarred from company;
Or where suspicion wanders but in sight
Of my dear sister, in whom you delight;
So shall you see my grief, and eke behold
My blooming color turned into the mould
Of pale-faced tawny, and all cheerful grace
To be eclipsed within my youthful face;
And as black grounds, they set off to the sight
Transparent colors, most of all the white.
So I being present, my pale hew will show
How fragrant Roses freshly bud and grow
In milke-white fields; I mean those Virgin plains,
Your cheeks imbelisht with Carnation stains.
If this you grant, or else consent that I
Shall you behold with my unworthy eyes,
Then may you free the wretched captived heart
Of thy poor vassal from all cruel smart,
And with that hap enrich my fortunes so,
That what want means I never more shall know,
What else to write I cannot tell, but this,
If you vouchsafe to grant me so much bliss,
As to permit me thy sweet face to see,
My self I Will prostrate with humility,
And kiss thy feet, and on my bended knee,
And eyes erected, ever honor thee.
Arnalte to the Traveller.
MY Letter ended, I did then implore
My sisters aid, entreating her once more
For to present unto Lucenda's view
This Letter which I have rehearst to you:
This she did grant me, being thereto moved
More through my treaties, than her will approved:
For shame forbad her, but then pure affection
O're-came all hindrance, and gave her direction.
Then like to those who do expect their fate,
With speed she hasted for to obviate
Her good or ill, and to Lucenda she
Tendered the Letter that was sent by me;
But she was forced unanswered to return
To wretched me, whose heart in flames did burn
Of fiery love, still fewel'd with disdain,
Which did increase more furiously my flame,
This moved my sister daily to end endeavor
TO effect some means that she might me deliver.
Then on a day virtuous Lucenda and
My sister meeting, she could not withstand
My sisters treats, though her defense were great,
But did vouchsafe that I with her should speak.
This sentence added wings unto the speed
Of my dear sister, who was glad indeed,
To bring me tidings of so great a bliss,
And thankt great Jove that he had daign'd her this,
That she was borne the bearer for to be
Of the good news which she did bring to me:
She did rejoice, and then did declare
What was decreed of sweet Lucenda, fair
As bright Aurora, Conduct to the Day,
Whose Roseate blushes to our sight displayes
Phoebus approach each day when he does rise
From Tethys bed, to travail through the skies.
Who ever saw a Prisoner doomed to death,
Gain a Reprivall for his sentenced breath,
And that unlook't for, since he has no hope
But for to breath his last by Sword or Rope;
Is so transported, that he scarce believes,
Hearing the Injunction of those new decrees?
But being assured, he with excess of measure
Courts this his Fortune with a world of pleasure.
Or else a Pilot in a raging storm,
Deemes Bark, and goods, himself, and all forlorn,
Since whirling winds feloniously do crack
His twisted Cables, cause his Anchors slack
Their forked hold, and drive him in despite
Of Steer, or Helm, he knows not wrong or right:
Mounting him one while to the azur'd sky,
And then as soon red rive him furiously
Unto the bottom of the vast extent
Of Neptunes foaming watery Regiment:
Whilst thus he is tossed on the Sea-swelling waves,
And well-nigh swallowed in their watery graves,
Fraught with despair, possessed he never more,
Shall set his footing on the sandy shore,
Does suddenly through light of Phoebus ray,
Spies from a far the prospect of a bay.
Yet former fear has so possessed his breast,
And present ruin, that he fears this blessed
Appearance's but an object of illusion,
His hopes to flatter, ere their last confusion,
But then the winds (though angry) and the light
Give him full view of what he had in sight:
Th'irefull Seas transport him where the Tide
Does drive his Bark, that it may safely ride.
Then being safe, and out of dangers way,
He thanks great Jove, and with the cheerful day
Does rowse his spirits, and expels quite
The sad remembrance of the passed night:
Even thus was I, until that news reprieved
My dying soul, and my sad heart relieved.
For scarce my Sister had breathed out her words,
But sweet content such pleasure me affords,
That whilst I lived, I never did possess
Such sweet delight, and pleasing happiness:
For, for to express it it is impossible:
My tongue's too weak my own delights to tell,
My anguishes were metamorphosed
To sudden joys, sorrow from me fled
With swiftest speed: with mirth and pleasure then
My soul and heart did jointly entertain
That blessed news, and at that very time
Love did me cherish, saying he was mine.
But then the Guardians of the bright-fac't Day
Had set the hour, and we must away
Unto the place assigned; for we did come
When as bright Titan, otherwise the Sun
Comes dancing forth, Heavens Eastern-gate set wide,
To mount his Chariot, which does for him bide.
Unto a Chapel then I did retire,
Unto a Cell, where usually the Friar
Used for to shrift the people who confess
Their sins, and crimes, with their past wickedness.
Joining to which Lucenda straight-wayes came,
And took her seat; I seeing of the same,
The place consenting, I began to show
With words and tears my torments and my woes,
Arnalte to Lucenda in the Friars Cell.
FAirest of Ladies, Mistress of my heart,
Renowned Lucenda, Auth'resse of my smart;
The gracious favor, and the honored grace,
Which at this present you to me vouchsafe;
It Is truly such, that I for e're despair
To recompense thy kindness, or thy care:
Unless my service it may satisfy
In some respects thy noble courtesy;
Sweet love accept them, and dear Mistress let
My weeping eyes; and sorrowful aspect
Give thee assurance of my constant love,
Which whilst I live I vow shall never move.
The Pelican shall never more express
Unto her young ones her kind tenderness.
The Negro Moore shall change his swarthy hew,
The gods shall homage unto mortals do,
E're I forsake to love and honor thee;
Why then, why then release my poor heart free,
Redress my wrongs, relieve me, do me right,
In liew of sorrow, grant me sweet delight:
Pity thy Captive, and some favor show
Unto my heart inveloped with woe.
File of those shackles, with which thy disdain
Has fettered me, release me out of palne.
Let this incite thee, fairest, to apply
Some cooling Cordial, for alas I fry,
And burn in flames of hot tormenting fire,
Kindled by love, continued by desire.
Oh help me now, for it will more redound
Unto thy praise to save, than to confound.
Alas, alas, I suffer not alone,
Others are wronged; for why, my grieving moan
Has shown my torments so perspicuously,
That diverse meaning for to love, do fly
From love with speed, fearing alas to be
Scorcht with the fire of discourtesie.
Then since its thus, (thou wonder of our times)
Repent thee of thy former passed crimes;
Sweet I beseech thee, these thy faults amend,
And with thy kindness cherish me thy friend.
I do not know what reason that you have
Not to be served, when all others crave
For to possess those things which you refuse,
And with their wills, what you forsake, would choose*
It is most easy for to know, that I
Have far more want, nay, more necessity
Of thy assistance, than thou have desire
That I should serve thee; or to quench the fire
Of my hot sufferings. Oh, how is my heart
Suppressed with tortures, and afflicting smart!
What rude encounters, what assaults have I
With-stood with courage through my constancy!
What cruel combats has my fainting hope
Delivered me! how has my faith taken scope
For to assault me! that to thee it is known,
They have my health impaired, and overthrown.
Alas, alas, is it possible for me
With words to utter (fairest) unto thee
The perturbations that I have endured
Within my mind, in no wise to be cured
But by thy aid? could this effected be,
How would thou blame thy self for harming me.
Oh never man endured such a cross!
Oh, never man joyed less hap, more loss!
Oh never yet so great a memory
Did with Oblivion insepulted lie.
Thus my affection, linked with disdain,
Sends Death unto me with a world of pain:
This I would let thee Lady understand,
That you henceforward may your will command
To right my wrongs, that so you in the end
May prove my Mistress, and my dearest friend:
And eke acquaint thee with the smarting pain
And tedious torments that I do sustain,
Thereby to show thee, that my constancy
Maugre all tortures, yet did never dye;
Nor have I found my self to be as yet
Weary of what you please on me to inflict:
For I have deemed my loss a prize to be,
Since you have gained what was lost by me.
Not is it without great reason, for if I
Endure afflictions, your Sun-shaming eye
Is cause of it, that superexc'lent grace,
Which Nature lent to beautify thy face.
Now since thou art certain of the love I bear
To thee my Sweet, in all perfections rare,
You Would injure reason, and injustice do
Unto my faith, if so be it that you
Establish not new orders to your will,
Restoring life to him you well nigh kill.
Now that you may hereafter exercise
Works of Repentance, listen to my cries,
And grant dear Lady, that I may inherit
The happy favor, since it is my merit,
To touch your fair hands with a reverent kiss,
I crave no more, then Sweet now daigne me this.
Grant me this favor Lady, besides which
I shall not dare no other to beseech:
Yet if I should chance to transgress, confine
Me to such tortures as you please: divine
And glorious Lady, if I ever swerve,
Let me be punished as I do deserve.
Lucenda's Answer to Arnalte.
HAd I Arnalte, but such fluent strains,
Or high-tun'd words, (compacted by the pains
Of sweet-tongu'd Rethorick) as thou do express,
Ingeniously I unto thee confess,
I should have skill to answer thee as well,
As thou have Art, thy sorrows for to tell.
Long since it is, since that thy presence and
My shame assiege me with a well-train'd Band
Of invitations, who do so oppose
And ward themselves from my word-speaking blows,
That they do drive me into such a straight,
That I believe all aid will come too late;
Being so confounded, and perplex't in mind,
That no relief in any thing I find:
Since that my fame has gained so deep a wound,
That Art, nor words can e're recure it sound.
For though my ignorance do me acquit,
Yet Reason checks me with her curbing bit,
And does condemn me, since my honored fame
I Have hazarded, and says I am too blame.
Thou animat'st me that I should convert
Thy sad disasters into pleasing mirth:
I rather have more cause to mourn and grieve
For my transgressions, than thee to relieve.
Since what thou suffer'st, it is sufferable,
My honor causing't to be tolerable:
For why the offense, the which I perpetrate
At this same instant, will precipitate
My honor head long, or at least defame
With foul disgrace my clear unspotted name,
And thus the danger which does threaten me,
Since I forget my self, to speak with thee,
May sooner to thy disadvantage chance,
Than to thy profit, or thy gain to inhance:
For I do fear thou can not silent be,
Or bar thy lips with bolts of secrecy,
Clouding the triumph which thou do obtain
In mists of silence, from the ear of fame.
For oftentimes the joy that we conceive
Of supposed favor, does our hopes deceive;
And so the tongue (too forward) does express
What the heart with reason strives not to confess.
Yet if you be so lavish, to report't,
It Is at my peril, and you will scale the Fort
Of my high-towring honor, and so raze
That to the ground, which yet has stood with praise.
How have thy treaties gained the upper hand,
That my resistance cannot them with-stand!
What woman is there that believes thee,
But to her self she must disloyal be?
Alas, alas, how danger does attend
Us silly Damsells, if our ears we lend
To men's persuasions, whose beginnings we,
If wise we were, we should both shun and flee.
Ah sad Lucenda, thou art now a slave,
And you Arnalte, name of Victor have:
But yet beware, lest that too much glory
Cause thee to loose through the extreme of joy
That which with grief, with sorrow, and with pain,
With sighs, with sobs, thou now of me do gain.
Take notice how that secrecy does heal,
That which report does wound, if he reveal.
Thou do entreat that thou my hands may kiss,
I am contented, but provided this,
You do not think that I do it permit
Through vain conceit, presumptuous pride, nor yet
From any merit, that I dare to claim
Unto my self, and that you will refrain
Henceforth to urge me, or solicit more
With irksome treaties, as you have heretofore;
And let thy Sister now a Testate be,
Who has already done so much for thee,
That she has gained me so far to transgress
The bounds of Reason, that I do express
My self s'oblivious, that I now do act
That which I do, in word, in deed, and fact.
Arnalte to the Traveller.
SCarce had Lucenda ended this her talk,
But that the hour forced us for to walk:
For It came to pass, so many people ran
Into the Church, that both of us were feign
For to depart; yet not without the grace
Which fair Lucenda did to me vouchsafe;
For she permitted my rude lips totouch
Her fair white hands, more white than snow unsmucht.
My Sister then, and I, we bad farewell,
And so returned, each where we used to dwell.
And now dread Jove I unto record call;
Might I have had the choysest of all
The Worlds rich wealth, and be engaged to lose
The hap I purchas't, I would it refuse:
This to affirm I do summon in
All constant Lovers, who have tossed bin
In Cupids Blanket, for they know full well,
That such a favor does all wealth excel.
Thus did I part content; my sister then
Seeing me gain my pristine health again,
With all essaies endeavored t'entertaine
My new delights to ratify my pain;
Desiring me that I would then repair
Into the Country for to take the air,
For she'de a house of pleasure, which did lie
Not far from Thebes, for it was hard by.
To this her motion I did soon consent,
And then as soon we on our journey went.
Where when arrived, I found the place to be
Seated by Natures careful industry,
Uery commodious for th'exercise
Of healthful hunting; (which some men do prize
Above all sports) this moved me cause my men
Bring me some Birding-Peeces, that (friend) then
I might essay, what with the agitation
Of that same pastime, and its recreation,
For to recover my decayed health,
Which sad affliction had o'rethrowne by stealth
Now while I so journ'd with my sister dear,
She feasted me, and made me such good cheer,
That in a short space I did there regaine
My manly color, and my strength again.
But on a day that I resolved to ride
Abroad a hunting, just as I would stride
My horse's back, diverse sad auguries
Did then appear unto my wondering eyes,
Which did presage, and eke denounce my fate,
My future ruin, and its wretched state:
For suddenly the Heavens, that were clear,
Fair, bright, and calm, straight-wayes did appear
Tempestuous, cloudy, wind and rain did fly
With stormy rage, and darkness veiled the sky:
Also a Greyhound, which I much did prise,
Ran 'twixt my legs, and there yelpt forth such cries
And horrid howlings, that they did confound
M'amazed senses with their bawling sound.
Yet I alas, who made but small account
Of such predictions, on my Steed did mount:
Nor all those lets could not my purpose stay,
But with my Hawke upon my fist away
Into the fields I rod, where scarsely I
Had 'gun my quest, but then immediately
I called to mind that it was long agone
Since I had seen the Gentleman, of whom
I have already spoke; and that since I
Had shown to him the love and loyalty.
And dear affection which I always bear
Unto Lucenda, he no more did care
TO associate me, but by degrees did shun
My company, or where I used to come;
Nor never came nigh me where I used to dwell,
Or once inquired, were I ill or well,
Ceasing to be so courteous, or so kind,
As formerly I did his friendship find.
No spark of goodness in his breast did shine,
Toward me all friendship did in him decline:
But 'cause I knew it was the proper kind
Of diverse men who have a wavering mind,
Not to be constant to their friends, but sickle,
For as they please, they can love much or little;
It moved me think that he had gained a touch
Of that infection, poisoned with too much
Ignoblenesse, which was the special cause
Of his non-servance of kind friendships Laws.
And then again I thought 'tmight sooner be
That Light^ings flame should blast Apollo's Tree,
Than that he would suffer that I should endure
The least of torments, if he could me cure.
Whilst thus I mused the depth of truth to sound,
My Hawke fell down stark dead unto the ground;
Which sudden chance did straight ways multiply
The doubts I had of Yerso's loyalty:
For suddenly my heart it was surprised
With grievous startings, and assaults: beside,
I did remember how my well-shap'd Hownd
Had whin'd that morning, grovelling on the ground.
Then thus disturbed, I did resolve to speed
Back to my Sister, mounted on my Steed;
But as I rode, I found my self to be
Upon a Mount, whence I might plainly see
Lucenda's Mansion, which did fairly lie
Unto the prospect of my roaving eye;
And also heard the noise and perfect sound
Of Drums and Haubois, which did there rebound
Their pleasant Echoes against the Mountains, and
The neighboring Hills, that there did proudly stand,
Rearing their heads in such a lofty wise,
As if they meant to parley with the skies.
This seemed strange unto my listening ear,
For it agreed not with the time of year
To use such pastime: thus I wax't far more
Pensive, and sad, than e're I was before,
Growing most jealous of my future loss,
Since that my fortunes proved to be so cross.
Well, there I stayed so long for to discry
The house, from whence those merry Tones did fly,
That Night o're-tooke me in her Ebon-Coach,
E're to my Sister I could then approach,
Who was accustomed daily for to wait
My coming, at the entrance of her gate,
There to embrace me; but at that same Tide
My dearest Sister did not for me bide,
Which did renew again my past distrust,
And then alas, this of all was worst:
I being entered, to the Chamber come
Where she did sit, she seemed to me as dumb;
A word she spoke not, but did sadly look,
As if all joy had her heart forsook.
This did amaze me, and I marvail'd much:
For since her silence unto me was such,
I durst not ask her ought, doubting to hear
By her discourse the news I much did fear.
But yet at length I could not so contain
My self with silence, or from words refrain,
But that I ask't her whence it did arise
That she sat drooping in that mournful wise:
At this the floodgates of her teare-drown'd eyes
Burst open through fury of her weeping cries:
From whence such streams of chrystal-teares did flow,
That to a deluge they began to grow;
Whose inundations did o're-flow so high,
That they did stop her passage of reply,
So that she could not answer me, until
Those floods were sunk, that then amain did swell;
But drying up those tears which trickled down,
Whose gushing Torrents did her eyes e'ne drown,
She did declare, how at that present tide,
Lucenda was the fair espoused Bride
Of youthful Yerso, who I ever deemed
My faithful friend, for so he always seemed.
And that as then she did to me relate
As she did hear, they still did celebrate
The Nuptial Banquets, and the custom'd Rites
With Maskes, with Revells, and such used delights.
When this I heard, I do protest my friend,
I thought my life would straight have taken an end:
For my poor heart was suddenly assailed
By woes Armado, that my spirits failed;
Which so amazed me, that a long while I
Stood mute, and dumb, nor could a word reply.
Thus were the signs presig'd unto me shown,
And eke the noise I heard unto me known;
Which so disturb me, that I in the place
So rudely fell, grovelling on my face;
That those who then were present, did esteem
I was intranst, for so I then did seem.
But then as soon as I could breath again,
I took all Letters, subscribed with the name
Of fair Lucenda; nay, I did not leave
One single line which I of her received,
But tore them all in that same raging vain:
Then growing wild, through fury of my pain,
I being lost, and void of further hope,
Despair I welcomed, who did soon take scope
For to inflame me with ten thousand thoughts,
Which in my brains a strange distraction wrought,
So that I did unroote my Beard, and tare
From off my head whole handfulls of my hair:
Although such actions (friend) I must confess
Seem womanish, and weakness'e do express;
Yet blindfold Love does by his Laws confine
To such extremes his servants many times:
Then some days past, and that the consolation
Of my dear sister, with her mild persuasion
Had in some sort asswag'd my anxious grief,
And by her care had tendered me relief,
I gave a special order unto those
Who waited one me to wear mourning clothes.
Soon after which, a Damsel to me came
That served Lucenda, that Angelicke Dame:
It was the maid in whom she did repose
Great confidence, and durst to her disclose
Her private secrets, and moreover rest
Her inward thoughts within her trusty breast;
Who certifi'd me in her Mistress name,
How that her Lady was enforced and feign
To undergo that marriage, and that she,
More through theirksome importunity,
And urgent treaties of her Parents, (who
Claimed her obeisance as their proper due)
Than of her own consent, or proper will
She was constrained t'imbrace him vel or nil.
Having a long while heard her patiently,
And satisfied her, she did homewards hye:
But you must know that she rescounter'd me,
Clad with a Gown of black, (which did agree
In outward show, unto my inward grief)
About whose hembe (because I will be brief)
These Lines and Letters were embroydred round,
Which being read, this meaning forth did sound.
Tell her that since that she has chose to be
Unto her Captive a submissive slave,
I do intend my life henceforth to save,
Living because she has vouchsaft it me.
This Gentlewoman well advised and wise,
Had great compassion of my mourning cries;
And you must think she was instructed by
Her honored Mistress, for to have an eye
As well to mark the habit that I wore,
As to observe me how I did deplore;
Which moved her glance upon my robe her eye,
Where in a moment she did soon espy
The Lines embroydred, whose conceit in mind
She well remembered, and then went to find
Her Dame Lucenda, leaving me as mad
At Yerso's treason, as my heart was sad
A their late marriage, of which when I thought,
Such an impression in my soul it wrought,
That I concluded for to challenge him
To combat with me, that before the King,
And all the world, he truly might confess
His treacherous dealing, and perfidiousnesse:
Which to effect, a Challenge I did send,
The words of which did to this purpose tend.
Arualte's Challenge to Yerso.
YErso, because that every one may know
Th'ignoblenesse, I do intend to show,
How faithless that thy lying drifts have been,
With which in secret I Have abused been:
Therefore in public I will manifest
Unto the world thy base perfidiousnesse;
Because henceforth thy punishment may be
A president unto eternity.
And for to punish justly thy offense,
Th'uncourteous actions, and base insolence,
I hope to vanquish, and to overcome
Thee with my hands; as also with my tongue
To use such words as shall thee quite defame,
And overthrow thee to thy utter shame.
But to the end that none may thee excuse,
Your self shall judge how you have me abused:
Revolve unto thy self and call to mind
How long its since unfeigned love did bind
So strict a league betwixt us, that we swore
To be companions, faithful evermore.
Remember too, how for a long while we
Have mutual been, with seemed fidelity,
Bearing a love so pious to each other,
That as two brethren we loved one another.
By which conjunction thinking that thou were
Faithful and loyal, of a noble heart;
My inward thoughts I have to thee reveald,
My private secrets I have not concealed.
And amongst many the affection that I bare
Unto Lucenda, in perfections rare,
In which thou did uphold me, promising
For to assist me, that I might her win:
Oh then thou spakst even as an impious slave,
For that thou might defraud me: Sir you have
By diverse ways, and sundry means expressed,
You were content to further my request,
Plything thy faith, that albeit that she
Thy Lady were, that yet for love of me
Thou would refrain to serve her, that I might
Purchase the enjoyment of my sweet delight;
which I believed so long, until the event
Did show the issue of thy bad intent:
For closely juggling thou have taken to wife
My dearest Mistress, dearer than my life,
The right usurping, with the recompense
Of all my travailes, contrary to sense:
By doing which, thou art not only grown
My enemy, but likewise art thy own:
At which I marvel, and do wonder much,
For well I know thy knowledge it is such,
That thou art witting, how that virtue, and
The works of friendship do united stand:
Yet ne'rethelesse before thou would take heed,
Thou have committed this ignoble deed,
Soyling thy honor, spotting of thy fame,
Blasting by teason thy renowned name,
Waxing so differ'nt from the noble parts,
And worthy virtues, lodged within the hearts
Of thy forefathers, as unto the sight
The black does vary from the purest white.
But to the end that thou may speedily
Receive disgrace for thy base treachery:
I let thee know, (perjured as thou art)
That I will slay thee, and transpierce thy heart
With those same weapons that you shall allot,
And cut in two the Gordian knitted knot
Of thy base life, casting thee forth the field,
Or else enforce thee humbly for to yield
Thy self my prisoner, causing thee confess
The Ignoble action of thy wickedness:
For Jove assisting, with my hands and thy*
Persidious, base, dishonest villainy
I shall revenge and wreake the injury
And base affronts which thou have offered me:
Therefore appoint what Arms we shall use,
As it is the custom, send me no excuse:
For having heard thy Answer, I Will assign
The Field, the day, and meet thee at the time.
Yerso's Answer to Arnalte's Challenge.
ARnalte, I thy challenge have received,
And by the Lecture the Contents perceived.
And eke according unto what you say,
If so be it that Fortune lead the way,
And that the event do prove as advantageous,
As thy affronting words do seem outrageous*
I shall account, if such good hap you have,
My self your vassal, and submissive slave,
Tendering to thee the name and worthy praise
Of a brave Victor, give thee up the Bays.
But soft, but soft, this current that does run
Within your brain, so strongly I will turn
Another way, and quite divert its course:
For in my hands you shall not find less force,
Than I do relish that thy words do taste
Of base aspersion, and black-mouthed disgrace:
Prate on, prate on, for as I may repute,
It Is you must babble, I must execute.
Thus shall thy arrogance and swelling pride,
Because that strangers, and moreo're beside
Thy Friends and Kindred scarcely shall bemoane
What I inflict upon thee, no not one,
Since 'twere injustice if thou should not feel
The Death you merit, from my pointed Steel;
That by that death thou might receive a true
And just chastisement, as to thee is due.
Thou do prepose unto the end that my
Transgressions may be known perspicuously,
I should remember of the mutual love
Frequent betwixt us, how we daily strove
TO exceed each other in our courtesies,
Loving each other as we loved our eyes;
Trusting in which thou did communicate
Thy secrets to me, and thy private state.
True, I confesse't, nor in the least will I
Paliate, dissemble, or the truth deny,
For so I should the bounds of truth transgress,
And injure reason, and all vertuousnesse.
Thus if thou had not publicly disgraced
My honor basely, in some private place
I would have satisfied thee, and at large
Have cleared my self of ought laid to my charge.
And sure I am that after that you should
Have heard me speak, Arnalte then you would
Have reckoned me rather for to be
Thy loyal friend, than faithless unto thee:
Since more for safety of thy health and life,
Than for my pleasure I have taken to wife
The fair Lucenda, hoping then thereby
To end thy torments and thy miseries:
For seeing that thou were not like to live
Any long while, but subject still to grieve,
I held it for the best to act and do
What I have done, unto the end that you
Having no future hope, might strive to gain
Thy former strength and pristine health again.
But since th'intents do justly justify,
Or else condemn one worthy for to dye,
Unto my thoughts I do myself refer,
For I am sure my love did never err:
Yet since the truth ought sooner for to be
Maintained by actions, than loquacity,
The judgment shall surcease until the day
Of Execution Phoebus shall display.
Then shall thou see what thou had gained, if that
Thou had not prated this reproachful chat;
And what thou'st lost, since thou have wronged me
By the aspersions of thy obloquie:
For by my right and thy base puffing pride
It shall be judged, and very plainly tried.
But since with thee I would not much dispute,
But purpose fiercely for to execute,
I do advise thee that thou shall recant,
And eat thy words as a base recreant:
Which to accomplish, I select and choose
The proper Arms that men at Arms use;
We will be armed as men at Arms be,
A cap, a pe, complete in each degree:
Only our right Arms they shall be excepted,
For they shall naked be, and quite detected.
Our Lances equal, each two Swords apiece,
Our Horses barb'd with Front-stalls, Crannets, these
The weapons are, now when you will, you may
Appoint the field, the hour, and the day;
For by the aid of him who ought to be
Judge 'twixt my wrongs and thy partiality,
I hope to slay thee, or to win the field,
And Victor-like enforce thee for to yield.
Arnalte to the Traveller.
NOw since the Arms were denoted, I
Did straight-wayes go to the Kings Majesty,
Informing him exactly of what had
Past betwixt Yerso and my self, (most sad)
So that he hearing th 'infidelity
Of my past friend, then grown my enemy,
It seemed so strange to him that he did yield
At my request to grant us both the field.
Then on the day assigned, Yerso and I,
We did appear before his Majesty,
He having caused a Scaffold for to be
Built and erected, that he there might see
Who should be Master of the field, and gain
A glorious conquest, to maintain his fame:
Then having viewed our Arms, which his Grace
Found very equal, th'oath used in that case
Being delivered, and that the Heralds they
Had gi'ne the Signal to the field, away
With speed we hasted for to take our course,
Running against each other with such force,
That the rude shock, of our rescounter did
Express what love was in our bosoms hid:
But Yerso then being as fortunate,
As a good Horseman he did penetrate
My naked arm with his pointed steel,
With which being wounded, I great pain did feel;
But as for my part, I had no such chance,
I only counterbuft him with my Lance
Upon the viser of his Helmet bright;
Yet did I not direct the stroke so right;
But that I mist to wound him with the thrust.
Thus by we rode, our Lances being burst,
Which flew to shivers, lying scattered round
Upon the verdent Grass and trampled ground.
Our Staves thus broke, we quickly did betake
Us to our keen-edg'd Swords, that they might make
Good what our Spears had failed of their pretense:
Then fiercely driving we did both commence
A fray so bloody, that the Crimson gore
Did trickle down upon the grass all-o're,
Thundering our blows with fury violent,
That through our Armor they a passage rent,
To make a way unto our vital parts,
That unawares they might surprise our hearts.
We sliced our Shields, we clave our Helmets bright,
And were so eager on our bloody fight,
That the Spectators weary were to see
The Combat last so long; as also we
Grew faint with striking and through loss of blood,
Which flowed from us like a purple flood.
But to be brief, I gained the victory,
And Yerso vanquished at my feet did lie:
By which his Treason plainly was proclaimed,
And my just right and innocence maintained.
Yet howsoever Yerso did disdain
A life of Alms, rather would maintain
His fame and honor by a warlike death,
Than by recanting to reprieve his breath,
And live dishonored to his utter shame.
Lucenda thus a widow did remain,
And I victorious: then the assembly gone,
With speed I hasted to my private home;
Where while I lay with wholesome means to cure
Those smarting wounds, the which I did endure,
I was advertised that Lucenda, she
Bewaild the loss she had obtained by me:
And with great sorrow moan'd the timelesse death
Of her slain husband, whose perfidious breath
I had exhaled; now that she might give over
Her lamentations, and no more deplore
His deserved death, I did resolve to proffer
My service to her, and more-o're to offer
If It should be pleasing to her, to supply
The place of Yerso with more constancy,
And be her Husband, she my honored wife,
Who I would cherish rather than my life.
A Letter of Arnalte to Lucenda.
Mirror of Women, Natures chiefest jewel,
Oh thou whose eyes are wanton Cupids fuel,
Beauties Idea, sweet perfections grace,
For all perfections harbor in thy face.
Pardon my faults, oh do not on me frown,
But with thy favor my expectance crown:
Deny me not thy mercy, but vouchsafe
For to protect me, and to keep me safe.
I must confess that I have injured thee;
Yet have compassion on my misery:
And Lady, though for peace I intercede
In time of war, or for thy pity plead,
Let me entreat thee that thou will not take
It in ill part, since I this suite do make:
Rather to esteem thy virtue than the crime
That Is perpetrated against thee most divine
And glorious creature; for your eyes they have
A secret power how to kill or save.
Then since it in your gracious power does lie
To kill, or save; oh help, or else I dye.
As for the chance that lately did befall
Thy livelesse Husband, I great Jove do call
To witness, how it grieves me; for why, best
He knows what thoughts do harbor in my breast
Yet though it grieve me for the sake of him,
Sweets in respect of thee 't has pleasing bin:
For had I not (fair love) offended thee,
Thou could not, could not have absolved me,
Showing the virtue of forgiving, which
Most brightly does thy purest mind enrich.
Now to the end it may be manifest,
And to the world perspicuously expressed
That thou forgiv'st me, let thy sorrows be
Governed by reason, not extremity.
If otherwise thou do lament or plain,
Thou Wilt tax thy credit, and receive great blame.
Oh then, oh then deny me not this pleasure,
By far transcending India's golden treasure:
Since by the purchase we may both remain
Content, and I for ever freed from pain;
Showing thy pity and thy mercy to
The man, to whom thou oughtst for pardon sue.
Alas, alas, I know thou art so sad,
That I do doubt to gain, in that regard,
The hap I wish for; since that in the time,
When as thou were more likely to be mine
Than now thou art, I never could arrive
Unto the port to which my thoughts did drive;
Although, dear heart, I felt more stronger gailes
From thy mild favors, which imbreath'd my sails;
Yet howsoever I vow never to require
That thing of thee which you shall not desire:
For should my pains enforce me to transgress,
My fears shall straight oppose my wilfulness;
Yet if you will direct your course, and sail
By Reasons Compass, you will hardly fail
TO account your self rather a foe to be
Unto your self, than not a friend to me.
For say I Have slain thy husband: why his death
Has stopped the passage but of one man's breath:
But you, who have so many murdered, never
Did yet repent, or shed for one a tear.
Thus think of me, as thou would others have
To judge of thee, although I am thy slave;
Which if you grant, I soon shall feel m' offense
To be remitted with large recompense.
Thy deceased husband has so wounded me,
That of my health the Doctors disagree;
Yet spite of Fortune, or her utmost hate,
Or all the afflictions of my cruel fate,
I dread no danger, for my outward smart
Is far unlike the sufferings of my heart:
For it is long since (dear love) that Cupids dart,
Headed with thy bright eyes, have pierced my heart,
And made so large an Orifice, that those
Grand wounds I suffered from the smarting blows
Of vanquished Yerso, seem, alas, to be
But petty scratches, wholly disagree
From the condition of my inward pain,
Whose cruel tortures does my heart inflame
With burning ardour, that it does exceed
My outward hurts; for loves does inward bleed.
Thus I do muster daily in my brain
Ten thousand thoughts; I also entertain
As many fancies, which my thoughts control,
Whose sudden discord wracks my wavering soul:
Yet amongst so many, there is but one, the which
Does my sad heart with future hope enrich:
Which I Will reveal, unto the end that my
Most constant faith, and faithful loyalty
May be most certain; yet (sweet friend) before
I do rehearse it, let me thee implore,
For to consider that it is in vain,
To think by tears thy husband to regaine:
For what death seizes with his mortal hand,
It Is merely lost, no force can him withstand:
For it is most certain, neither art or skill,
Honor, or goodness, can prevent the ill
Of our malignant Stars, nor birth, or state
Divert the Omen of our dying Fate.
Therefore never hope for to recall to life
Yerso, to whom thou lately were a wife,
But rather take my counsel, and replant
That love in me, which you to him did grant:
For since I Have taken him from thee, if you please
I will be yours, and your griefs appease,
Yet if his love has so blind-folded thee,
Or so obscured your judgment, not to see
How I deserve, or think I am not fit
TO enjoy thy love, nor that I merit it:
Oh be not so opiniate, nor believe
Thy judgment so, but let some others give
Thee better counsel, for alas I doubt
Yerso's sad chance has chased all reason out:
Then shall you see how your resolves agree
With your friends counsels, as concerning me.
Yet, under favor, I must tell you, that
He does deserve, who has had such good hap
And power to vanquish him, who had the name
Of thy dear husband, justly for to claim
All rights and titles which he did possess,
Enjoying thee, thou cause of my distress.
As for my birth, my honor, or my stare,
My parentage, it is needless to relate:
In vain it were rare Paragon to shew't,
Since you fair love as well as I do know it,
Then if the merits of my travells have
Not yet deserved the favor that I crave,
Which is to have thee for to be my Wife,
And fairest Spouse, who ever as my life
I mean to cherish, you your self shall be
The faithful Judge betwixt your self and me:
For well I know that thou most certain art,
That for to love thee, I have felt much smart,
Loathing my life, since I could never gain
A recompense to ratify my pain.
Now if you please some succor for to lend,
I do entreat you will your Answer send.
Arnalte to the Traveller.
MY Missive ended, I my Sister caused
To come unto me, who as sorry was
To see my hurts, as she was glad that I
Had gained the honor and the victory:
Yet howsoever it did grieve her much
That Yerso's chance did fall out to be such.
Then at her coming I did straight repeat
My resolution, and I did entreat
Her to advise me; then did she reply,
She wondered at my bold audacity:
Yet howsoever, since it might expiate
The influence of my prodigious fate,
She took my Letter, and away she hy'd
Unto Lucenda, who no sooner spied
My Sister, but sh' entreated her to be
At those same Nuptials that were caused by me.
My Sister then she knew not what she meant,
But afterward she saw it by the event:
For at that time her friends and kindred were
Assembled all for to conduct and bear
Her company to a religious house,
Which she had chose to celebrate her vows,
And to reside the remnant of her days,
Singing sad Dirges and lamenting Lays.
My Sister then arrived at that time,
Desired to see the event of their design,
Which happened thus Lucenda, (with her friends
My Sister following to observe their ends)
Being arrived, and to the covent come,
There took the Order of a hooded Nun.
But 'cause till then my Sister could not find
A sit convenience for to show her mind,
Taking occasion by the fore-top, she
'Gan show Lucenda what was sent by me:
But she no sooner heard my name, but from
My faithful Sister in a rage she flung,
Calling the Abbess, to whom she did relate,
She was not entered through her arched gate
Into her house, for to consent that she,
Who was the Sister of her enemy,
And mortal foe, should have the liberty
To importune her with her urgency.
Which when my Sister heard, she speedily
Departed thence, and home to me did hye,
Striving to obscure and to paliate
The sid report of my most cruel fate:
Yet ne'rethelesse distrust did soon detect
Her fained fictions, which I did suspect.
Ah where is that Lover that e're had the like
Disgrace, and craved not thin-chop'd death to strike
Him to the heart? which I had soon obtained,
Had not my friends perforce my life maintained.
Thus hope fled from me, nor no means was left
To comfort me, of joy I was bereft:
Then knowing not where to have refuge, I
Turned to great Jove, whom most submissively
I did beseech with prayers, for to daigne
His gracious pity to redress my pain,
But for my sins and former wickedness,
He gave no ear unto my sad request:
Thus gaining no ease, neither from Jove above,
Nor of the world, or of the blind-god Love,
I did resolve to go unto some place
So solitary, that being there, my face
No mortal man should e're behold again,
There to condole my torment and my pain.
This when my Sister heard, it did so fright
Her tender heart, as if some horrid sight
Had stood before her; thus amazed she,
Weeping extremely hasted unto me,
Casting her self there prostrate on the ground,
Then at my feet these words she did propound.
Belisa to her Brother Arnalte.
I Know dear Brother, that you do intend
To take a journey shortly, to an end
So strange, that is only for to quench the flash
Of your light humor; for it is so rash
And unadvised, that you do express
Your self quite void of Reasons solidnesse.
Alas, alas, I do beseech thee for
Jove's glorious sake, thou will this thought abhor,
Chase forth thy mind these wandering fantasies,
Press them to death, that they no more may rise
Up in rebellion: Oh be not conscious that
Report may scatter a reproachful chat
To thy disgrace; but let it be thy care
That slander do not thy true worth impair.
Consider too, that those who shall take note
Of thy departure, that they will report
That more for fear of Yerso's kindred, then
Through loves sad anguish thou art fled from men.
Have a pre-sight to all mishaps that may
Through selfe-opinion wrong thee any way;
And weigh their ends, lest when it is too late
You do repent, and curse your wilful fate;
For it is most frequent, when the means is gone,
That then Repentance swiftly comes on:
Then do not seek to cloud thy honored fame
In a strange absence, or undo thy name.
If this prevail not, call to mind, if you
Leave me alone, alas, what shall I do?
For well you know my honor is conserved
By the rare worth long since by thee deserved.
Thus if you leave me, I shall be esteemed
Rather a stranger, than henceforth be deemed
A Thebian Damsel; ah dear brother have
Thou kissed Oblivion, or of Lethe taste,
That thou forget'st that death did snatch away
Our honored parents (now involved in clay)
The last great Plague, he being summoned in
By the three Sisters, one of whom does spin,
The other reeles, the third cuts with a Knife
The fatal thread of man's uncertain life:
Yet ne'rethelesse I still enjoying thee,
Have deemed my self as well allied to be
As e're I was, as also for to have
As many friends, as when the dungeon-grave
Did never enclose one to our blood affin'd:
For they being dead, their love in you I find.
Do not consider that you much do loose,
If you the acquaintance of your friends refuse?
Remember how the King has bred thee, and
Look on the Country, and observe the Land
Which you forsake: behold th'abundant store
Of wealth and riches that you leave, before
You take this course so contrary to sense,
That all will blame you if you do commenc't.
Believe me brother, and be cautious too
To act those things that may redound unto
Thy disadvantage, for the mountains can
Not there commend thee for a worthy man;
The fierce wild beasts, that range the fields for food,
Can not distinguish 'twixt the bad and good:
Nor have the Birds the Judgment or the Art
To consolate thy sad distressed heart.
Who then shall praise thy Feats of Chivalry,
Or blaze thy fame above the starry sky,
Or moan the time that you spend there in vain,
Instead of striving to atchieve and gain
Transcendent honor and deserved praise
In bloody battles and in Princely fraies?
Have thou forgot that the most noble kind
Of generous spirits and heroic minds,
Do enterprise the things most intricate,
Though death and danger on their purpose wait?
If this persuade not, why, at leastwise think,
How your past acts, and renowned fame will sink
Down to the bottom of the Lethean Lake,
If this your journey you do undertake.
Say that distress or sickness should befall
You in that Desert, on whom could you call
For some assistance? Oh there is none to bear
In thy afflictions the least part or share:
Then is it not better that you should abide
In this your Country, and henceforth reside
With those with home you ever used to live?
Being so wise, not desp'rately to give
Thy self to ruin: but forsake the intent
To live with Beasts in pensive banishment,
Where none can help thee, or thy wants supply.
And you being absent, where alas shall I
Bestow my self? to whom shall I complain,
When as the friends of Yerso (by thee slain)
Shall terrify me, and upbraid my fame,
Casting aspersions on my honored name?
Ah brother, brother, for his glorious sake,
Who with a word the universe did make,
Moderate thy sorrow, and assuage thy grief,
Comfort thy self, and daigne thy self relief.
Arnalte to Belisa.
I Have dear sister plainly understood
What you have told me for my future good:
For which I thank thee, yet let my reply.
Assure thee that most consid'ratly
I have premeditated on each word,
The which your goodness did to me afford;
And in the thought of that imagination,
Each point disturbs me with a vehement passion;
So that they jointly have surpised my heart
With far worse pangsthan raw-bon'd death does dart;
For anxious grief within my breast took place,
And swam in tears, which did o're-flow my face.
And this dear sister, most especially
I have endured for thy sake: for why,
All other torments I can lightly bear;
But as concerning thee I much do care,
For you I grieve; I do not moan the smart,
Which Vulture-like still preys upon my heart:
I dis-esteeme it in respect of thee,
For why loves warrant has delivered me.
Thus I shall be perhaps excused by some,
And eke enforced to undergo the doom
Of diverse others; let 'em speak and spare not,
In this respect, alas, alas I care not:
For the pure virtue which is truly known,
Cannot be injured, or disgraced by none;
Thus shall the opinions which are held of me,
Prove most part false, and feigned for to be.
Thou do prepose that 'twill be thought amongst men,
That more for fear of Yerso's kindred, then
Through the afflictions of my torments, I
Do take this journey, and away do fly.
Fearing I should receive the selfsame pay,
Which I paid Yerso, when I did him slay.
Oh think not so, but be thou confident,
That there is not one, who ever nobly meant,
Or truly loved, as will imagine such
A base conceit as may my honor smutch:
For well they know the worth of valor bides
Ever most constant where true love resides:
And eke more-o're, I am not so unknown,
But that my worth (of Fames loud Trumpet blown)
It is sufficient to obscure and shroud
Such base reports in dark oblivions Cloud.
Thou do entreat me also to remember
My goods, my servants, and my safety tender:
As for my servants, I so think of them,
That if there is any that will follow, when
I shall depart from this unpleasing place.
Their company with thanks I will embrace,
Rather to express the indulgent love I bear
Unto their kindness, or their friendly care,
Than that I want or have necessity
Of their assistance, or society.
Now for my wealth and treasures, from this time
You are their Mistress, for I make them thine;
And for the rest, oh deem me not to be
S'ignoble base, as that I would leave thee
Alone, forlorn, desolate, and forsaken,
Wretched, oppressed, but if, thou art mistaken:
For e're we part, with care I will provide,
That I may see thee, e're I go, a Bride
Joined to a husband, who shall still remain
With thee (I absent) to maintain thy fame.
And now I will one thing of thee require,
And this it is; dear sister I desire
That thou wilt take courage to thee; and that when
I shall retire from the sight of men,
Your lamentations put me to no trouble,
Nor your bewailings my afflictions double.
And lastly Sister; for I think 'twill be
The last request I e're shall make to thee;
Let me entreat thee that continually
Thou Wilt plain and tax Lucenda's cruelty;
Ever remembering my untimely Fate,
And utter ruin, caused by her hate:
Yet if you see there is any likelihood,
Or expectation for my future good,
Or that she should repent her, and bemoane
The ills I suffer, under which I groan
With end less tortures; let that expiate
Alone thy wrath, no other vengeance take:
Since in this hap, the happy means does lie,
Tho which alone can gain my liberty.
Thus I will cease to entertain your ears
With my sad words, breathed out with sighs and tears,
'Cause I Will avoid thy importunity,
And fond objection of thy vain reply.
At these my words my sisters tongue was tied,
Her lips were barred, she never more replied
One word or accent, the which might disswad:
My resolution, or my breast invade
With contra liction this my fixed intent
She never essayd to alter, or prevent
Then being healed of my wounds, I went
Unto the King, and showed him my intent,
Beseeching him most friendly to bestow
A husband on my sister, who might show
Such constant friendship, and such mutual love,
As does the Turtle to the harmless Dove.
This on his royal word he promised me
For to accomplish: then thrice Noble he
Having performed what I did require,
And satisfied most nobly my desire,
With urgent treaties importuned my stay,
And disadvis'd me from so strange a way;
Preposing to me that it was ill done,
On this my course so rashly for to run,
Leaving my Country and my habitation,
My goods, my sister, to court desolation:
But since his will and mine did disagree,
In our resolves there was no harmony:
For the opinion which he did propound,
On the same key, with mine they did not found;
Thus, differing both in our opinions, I
Took my last leave, leaving his Majesty
Sufficiently assured, that my will
I would accomplish, and my mind fulfill.
At which the King was so displeased, that he
Would not vouchsafe his gracious leave to me:
Yet ne'rethelesse, casting all things aside
Which may prevent me, though my friends decide
The case, most strongly urging, how that I
Did run the hazard of much misery:
I weighed it not, or did I heed the cries
Which ran like Rivers from the swollen eyes
Of my sweet sister, intermixed with groans
And sad laments, of force to soften stones.
But after many loving Ceremonies,
And kind fare-wells, I did with watery eyes
Take my last leave of all my friends and kin,
And then my journey I did straight begin,
Which soon was spread abroad, and shrill report
As soon had blazed it in the King his Court:
Which being told his Grace, (although my fame
I must confess such honor could not claim)
He did vouchsafe so far to honor me
Himself, and Nobles in their gallantry,
As to conduct me onward in my way
Unto a place that from the City lay
Some Furlongs distant: now excuse me friend,
If to thy ears I do not recommend
The words we had at parting, or else show
The sighs and groans which from our hearts did flow,
For without tediousness I cannot tell
The passages which 'twixt us then befell:
But let that pass, and know my weeping cries
And brynie tears which trickled from the eyes
Of my kind Sister, at that time did sever
Both she and I, not for a time, but ever.
And then the King and his attendants they
Returned to Court, I followed on my way;
Continuing which, I soon did feel my smart
To be disburden'd of much anxious smart:
So that I found this course far to surpass
My residence, which in rich Thebes was.
For my misfortunes rather chose to bide
With Bears and Lions, than for to reside
Longer with men, indu'd with reason, though
Their qualities a brutish diffrence show.
Then having traveled many days, I found
My self arrived by chance on this same ground,
So desolate, so uncoth, so o're-growne,
As thy hard passage unto thee has shown.
But having gained this sad, solitary,
Rough, ragged mountain, being e'ne a weary,
Consid'ring of its private situation,
Resolved t'erect thereon this habitation
Of such materials as might signify
Lucenda's hatred and strange cruelty.
Thus friend you have heard the sum of all my grief,
And how I Have lived suppressed without relief:
Thou also know what sad afflictions I
Have undergone through my firm co^stancy;
And eke what battles and assaults I have
Sustained for love, who used me as his slave.
But now kind friend, if my Discourse has stayed
Thee from thy business; and likewise delayed
Thy purposed journey, least wise if a man
Involved in woes and sorrows as I am,
Have not deserved that thou should troubled be
In such a sort, as thou have been by me:
Let me beseech thee that thou will suspense
Thy then just anger, and remit the offense
Of such a wretched Caitiffe, who must still
Live fraught with sorrow and heart-killing ill.
Moreover Sir, since that thou do intend,
This day being past, to hasten to the end
Of thy set journey, bear still in thy mind
How thou have pawned thy faith, and left behind
A serious promise, justly to relate
To courteous Ladies my most wretched state.
Thus virtuous Ladies, our sad loving Knight
His sad misfortunes did unto me recite,
And eke discovered all such accidents,
Dispaires, mischances, woes, and discontents
As e're he suffered; now if I have proved
As tedious to ye, as I left him moved
With anxious passions, giving entertain
To his heart-tort'ring martyrdom and pain:
Yet if you please (rare ones) ye may dispense
With your distasts, and pardon my offense;
For I assure ye honored Ladies, this
Which I have done, (although perhaps amiss)
Has only been to obey and satisfy
His sad requests and importunity:
As also to discharge my promise, and
Acquit my faith, which did engaged stand,
Not to offend your ears, or else presume
Your patiences with words to importune.
Also I do repose and eke confide
So great a trust and confidence beside
On your good natures, that you will connive
At my mistakes, and with your goodness strive
For to supply my want and my default,
Not once observing my ill-ordred talk:
But the desire which I have, to show
The service which unto your Sex I owe:
For it has been the sole efficient cause,
By which (Rare Ladies) I induced was,
Rather t'incurre the taxes of sharp blame,
Than in the least respect to dismaintaine
Your more retired Recreations, when
Ye shall repair unto your Books, or Pen,
Cloyed with excess of far more choice delight,
And pleasant pastime than I can recite:
Besides, I credit that ye are endew'd
With such bright-shining virtues, and infused
With so much goodness, yea, so richly dressed
With gracious pity harbored in your breast,
That the compassion which ye shall express
For the ill-usage and the wretchedness
Of our sad Lover, may perhaps invade
Your gentle bosoms, and in fine persuade
Your gracious selves t'accept then in good part
This the rehearsal of his anxious smarts,
Which I have published, being (Dames) confined
Thereto by his command which did me bind,
And eke incite ye to requite my pains
With thanks, for why I seek no other gains.
Likewise (ye best of women) that you will daigne
To second him, so to with-stand his pain,
Assisting him, thereby to undergo
The weighty burden of his grievous woe,
Taxing th'unkindnesse of this new-made Nun,
The cruel Authresse of his Martyrdom;
Who through her desp'ratenes has caused our Knight
Who most entirely loved her, to delight
In the acquaintance of ill-look't despair,
And fellowship of heart-lamenting care;
So that he has retird, himself confined
Unto a place cohering with his mind;
Alone sequestered, most recluse, where he
Daily expects heart-easing Death to free
Him from his passions which torment his heart
With endless tortures, and unheard of smart.
Now if's strange chance have not sufficient force
T'infuse some pity, or so me sad remorse
Within your bosoms, yet he does entreat
(Ye all by me) to harbor this conceit,
That he does rather cherish and maintain
His immense torments and extremest pain,
Since fair Lucenda therein does delight;
Than for to live in the most happiest plight,
That ever any mortal man possessed,
Since she denied him this true happiness.
But yet he hopes through process of fleet time,
Or through her virtues which most brightly shine,
That she will forget the too fond foolish love
Of her dead Husband, and at length remove
All thought of him, and in the end confess
That she has wronged me with her churlishness.
Now if this happy turn shall chance to fall,
Ere Destiny for his faint breath shall call,
He will remain content; or if it come
When he possesses his time-lasting home,
His spirit will rejoice, his joynt-falne bones
Repose more softer, though inhum'd amongst stones:
Thus you may see the hope with which I left
The mournful Knight, of joy quite bereft:
And eke the end of his discourse, the which
Although it be not copiously enrich't
With sweet-tun'd words, or high Cothurnick strains,
Composed by Rethorick, or inventions pains,
Yet pray accept it; it may serve for want
Of better matter, (which I know's not scant)
To entertain your Suitors, when they be
Familiar in your honored company:
Unto whose virtues and your famous graces
Adorned I hope with more than common faces,
My self and service I do recommend,
And vow to be your Servant till my end.
FINIS.
