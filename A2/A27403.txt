AN ANSWER TO John Gilpin's Book, Published in his name, and Subscribed by the
Priest of Kendal.

AND An ANSWER to an other false slander, as concerning Buggery, which he and
they slander the Quakers with, which was denied before any such thing was acted.

ALSO, Another slander which is cast upon them who are scornfully called
Quakers, By one Cotton Cosland of Stockworth, who hanged himself, who was seen
and denied, and was told that he was Judas, two years before, or there abouts
in Gainsborough, in one Woolsey's house, and there that man which hanged
himself, brought in false witness against them called Quakers, and both he, and
his witness was denied. And the thing in which they would clear John Gilpin
of, as of drunkenness, denied; and he proved and manifest to be such a one as
was declared of him before. And this do they fetch up which was two or three
years ago, to slander them that be in the Truth. And also, something in Answer
to Milners Prophecies.

From them who are called Quakers by the scorners.

LONDON, Printed for Giles Calvert at the Black-Spread-Eagle at the West End of
Paul's, 1655.

REader, thou may take notice of the diligence of the Children of darkness
(who, as our blessed Savior Jesus Christ has said, are wiser in their
generation then the Children of light) and especially of Thomas Walker Priest,
and John Myriel Schoolmaster: who were chief actors in contriving, and
publishing the first Book put forth in Gilpins name: who being grieved to see
the truth spread over their lies, and the light to comprehend their darkness;
have by themselves, and their Emissaries, in two or three years time, gathered
up in four Counties, viz, Cumberland, Westmerland, Lancashire and Yorkshire,
(in which Counties there are many hundreds of the people called Quakers) four
persons that have been found faulty, though none of them save Milner, was ever
owned as friends in the light, much less in the life: (a good testimony for
that people) Which had Thomas Walker been as diligent to have observed the
failings, and wilful practices of his own flock, he might to my knowledge have
made a large Catalogue; but my desire is not to justify the people, called
Quakers, by ripping up of others sores; for I know the Lord God of Heaven and
Earth is with them, and the shout of a King is among them, and according to
this time it shall be said of them, what has God wrought; and blessed is he
that blesses them, and cursed is he that curses them; and their godly
conversation shall, and has put to silence the mouths of many their
adversaries amongst whom they live; but in the light I see, that wrath is
cruel, and anger is outrageous, but who is able to stand before envy; and that
the wickedness of the wicked shall slay his own soul. And therefore, Thomas
Walker, cease from thy blasphemies against the light, lost he who is the Father
of lights, and dwells in the light, shut thee up in utter darkness, and give
thee thy portion amongst them who hated the light, whose deeds were evil, as
thine are, who not only would cover Gilpins drunkeness, but plead for his other
sins, making a mook at sin: who calls him civil whom thou do not deny but
was, and is drunk with sin; but also religious, and suitable to the Gospel of
Jesus Christ. No marvel therefore, that thou who attestest such things under
thy hand, questions thy own credit; and therefore procures others to certify
for thee, who if it would have stood with their credits, could have certified
more of John Gilpin, and his course of life, then thou, or thy friend Myriel,
who knew little of John Gilpin and his conversation, till thou declared thy
self openly an enemy of the light, and all the Children of the light, by thee
in scorn called Quakers, which how many of them have been imprisoned for thee,
and by thy means is well known to many in Kendal, whereof Thomas Sands and the
rest that have certified for thee, is not altogether ignorant; to whom John
Gilpin, and his conversation for many years past, and before thou or thy friend
Myriel knew Kendal, was well known: whose silence in the thing is more
testimony against John Gilpin, than thy rash forwardness can gain credit for
him, whose cred't cannot stand for clear testimony, without others certifying
what they believe of thee, which is as little as they can certify, while they
own thee for their Minister, if they should certify aany thing at all, but
fools loves to be meddling; And as for the testimony of Thomas Craister, Cuth.
Studholme, and Thomas Turner, who say, They dare not plead for iniquity; and
yet have taken upon them, to make null the testimony of Robert Wharton and
others who were eye witnesses of his drunkenness in Kendal, when they were off
Carlisle above thirty miles distant, let the wise judge; And who are not ashamed
to certefie a plain untruth, (and yet say, they dare not plead for sin) saying,
That John Gilpin has been indeed a man (as they will witness that knew him
formerly) not only virtuously inc^ined, but also of a very tender conscience:
insomuch that to affirm the contrary there can be nothing more false: (these be
their words.) Though I take no delight to meddle with others conditions, nor to
discover others nakedness at such a distance; yet for the Truths sake, and that
the simple may not be deceived with lies, nor men full of talk be justified; I
give this testimony of John Gilpin, (being one who formerly knew him, and his
education, living in the same Town of Kendal with him for about sixteen years,
and one that wished him well at least, not only in reference to his own
particular, but also to his deceased mother, who wilst she lived was one in
profession with me,) that his conversation was neither as became the Gospel,
nor a sober civil man. And if any of you subscribers, or John Gilpin himself
desire me to set down the particulars wherein; let him send his desires under
his hand, to him who is known to John Gilpin, and all, or most of you
subscribers by the name of

Gervase Benson.

An Answer to John Gilpins Book.
TO thee, Oh John Gilpin! and all the subscribers of thy book whose folly in
it is made manifest: out of you: which books, thou and you subscribers have
directed to the world: they are the best to receive it, and believe it, for the
world loves their own, and will receive their own, which lies in wickedness,
where the lying wonders is, and such are given over to believe lies; for to the
Children of light his book is not directed, but to the world, and the world
receives it which hate Christ, and all the Children of light, as John says,
which light brings to see all Gilpins signs and lying wonders, his
butter-flies and his Swallows, and his filthy Dream, sand all his running up
and down, and all his imitations and crosses, and all his music, which must be
turned into howling and sorrow, and wayling, and gnashing of teeth, which is
denied by all the Children of light. The man of sin has exalted himself, above
all this is called God, or that is worshipped, so that he as God fits in the
Temple of God, that he might be revealed in his due time, whose coming is even
after the coming of Satan with all power and lying wonders and with all
deceiveableness of unrighteousness in him and them that perish, because that
they and he did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved: for
this cause has God gi^en him and them up to strong delusions that they should
believe lies, that they all might be damned together, who believe not the
truth, but take pleasure in unrighteou^ness, for to the world has John Gilpin
and the rest of the sub^cribers, directed their book: they are of the world,
and the world hears them, therefore speak they to the world, and the world
hears them; and the whole world lies in wickedness: they who are Children of
light are not of the world, we which are in the light are of God, and he that
knows God, hears us; he that is not of God, hears not us, hereby we know
the Spirit of truth, and the Spirit of error. So, marvel not my brethren, if
the world hate you, and persecute you, as many of the subscribers to John
Gilpins book, has done, persecuted many, imprisoned many, for we know we have
passed from death to life, because we love the brethren, but he that loves
not his brother, abides in the death and who so hates his brother, is a
murderer, and has not eternal life abiding in him: so ye Children of light,
who see John Gilpin and his subscribers, where the man of sin is re^ealed, the
Son of perdition, comprehended, all you are with the light, which is your
condemnation: remember in your lifetime, you are warned, and you are in secret
read this: now, brethren in the light, be not ye so soon shaken in your minds,
neither by his books nor words, who has given heed to fables, and swerved from
the truth, and turned aside, and so now directs his book to his own, who
hears and receives it. He that has an ear let him hear, and understand he
that has an eye, for over to Satan is he turned and delivered, and so with the
wicked judged who are both with the light condemned, which from his lies and
fables, the Children of light are escaped: are not they of the world that do
persecut the, Children of light? are not they of the world, that are given over
to believe lies? are not they of the world that hears the world? are not they
of the world, that sends their writing to the world? and does the world hear
the Saints, and does not the world love her own, and did not ever the world
hate the Children of light? was John Gilpin come to that power that made the
Devils to tremble, and you who worship the beast whom all the world wonders
after to blaspheme, and does the beast blasphem the power of God, yea or nay?
was that the power of God that made the Devils to tremble in John Gilpin, yea
or nay? Answer, else confess in your silence guilty, and let your mouths be
stopped for ever: is it the power of God that makes the Devils to tremble, and
does not the world call this the power of the Devil, and so abuse the power of
God, nay or yea?

Having seen a book wherein the life and conversation of John Gilpin by
several hands certified that John Gilpin has ever walked as becomes the
Gospel, I have known him this 12 or 14. years, and this I can say and lie
not, he was never owned in the least, of any that had a profession, but was of
the sort which ran to all excess of riot, a common Drunkard, a Cocker, a
Gamster, as some of those is, which has given testimony of his
Gospel-conversation: but if this be their Gospel conversation, it with the
light of Christ is denied, and in judgment neither it nor they can stand, but
with the light is to be condemned, and with the Children of the light to be
denied and seen to be out of the Gospel. It is not the boasting Spirit that
lodges in the enemies of God (that can hurt the truth) which casts out
floods of water to destroy the truth, for in safety is it kept, neither those
high swelling words can hide him from the wrath of God, that is revealed, to be
powered forth upon all unrighteousness, and, know thou lier, that my testimony
is true and shall stand: and this I declare to all in the presence of him that
knows, that I lie not, that as I was passing down the high street in Kendall,
betwixt the place called the new Brigging, and the lower Well, John Gilpin was
passing on the street, in that place I sae him drunk: but they being so large
in their exposition of things, they may do the like of his drunkenness: these
are the signs which I shall declare, which will be a sufficient testimony that
he was drunk, first that he reeled to and fro, secondly turning to a side of
the street standing talking to a woman, was not able to stand without
wandering. Thirdly, his face inflamed scarce able to look with his eye, the
woman speaking to him but he could not speak plain, and the woman prayed God to
bless him. Thou say, that's true, that information was given in against him,
but not on oath. Reader, take notice that nothing will pass current with them,
unless it has the stamp of an oath: see here they are not in the doctrine of
Christ, that would have men to swears but out of the light they are shut, and
with the light is to be damned. And as for his friends, I charge them with
alie; they never came to me, and told me any such thing, as that it was a gross
forgery; neither did I give them any such answer, as that he was drunk with
sin, though it was his sin to be drunk, so let all that names the Name of the
Lord, depart from iniquity and the light mind that brings into purity, so thou
may stand in thy integrity, so will thou see the beast and the false
prophet, and their, lying wonders and with the light of Christ they will be
condemned. ( Robert Wharton) I having occasion into the fields upon my coming
back, over the neither brigg, I meet with John Gilpin, and I set my eyes upon
him, and I understood the man was drunk, and immediately his Wife coming out of
his own house, she desired him to go in, and he refused, and she began to
strugle with him, and so with much to do she got him in, and as for what he
was formerly I well know, he was a common Drunkard, a Cocker, a Gamster, and
with such like actions and practices brought his Wife and Children to penury
and want.

And for the heads and cheifest of your witnesses, which here confirms your
lies and reports upon hearesay, because you report it,

I Who is known by the name of George Tailor of Kirkby Kendall, in the County
of Westmorland, do declare in the presence of the Lord God, against John Archer
(who is called one of the Justices of the Peace, for the same town and County,
and one of the chief witnesses) that he is a detestable Blasphemer, a
notorious liar, and persecutor of the Saints: for he was not ashamed to
maintain, that the light of Christ spoken of (in John) was natural, that none
was redeemed from strife, and that the light in Cain led him to slay his
brother. And though for writing and declaring against these abominations, he
caused me to suffer imprisonment above twenty days, yet the same now I am
willing to Publish for the truths sake and to seal the same testimony, if it
were with my blood, against John Archer whose name and nature stinkes in the
nostrills of the Lord God.

George Tailor.

ANd for Edward Turner, that Cavalier, who is given to drunkenness, swearing,
and cursing, for which or some of these he should have suffered a fine in the
time of his being Major, when he witnessed the relation of another drunkard,
John Gilpin to be true, and he should have had his goods distraind upon not
paying his fine, had not John Archer for love to wickedness and to robb the poor
passed by it.

George Tailor.

ANd the said John Archer Justice of Peace (so called) A man being brought
before him for swearing and other mildemeanors, and being convicted, and his
fine set which came to fifty shillings, John Archer through the solicitation of
his brother in Law, Roger Bateman, being a great man in the Country, took only
two shillings sixpence instead of two pounds, ten shillings, and so became a
Breaker of the Law, and a Robber of the poor.

John Came.
And these are the witnesses of Gilpins book.
Whereas there is a slander put upon them whom the world scornfully calls
Quakers by one as it is made manifest of their own, as concerning a Mare, all
such beasts and beastly tricks and works of the flesh, we abhor and deny whom
the world scornfully calls Quakers, though such a one came among the Quakers to
their meeting certain times, but since he left off coming to their meeting, it
is near a quarter of a year, so with the light all such acts and actors is
eternally condemned with the light from them whom you who are of the world
^^ornfully calls Quakers whole unity is in the light which condemns all such
practices, as is aforementioned contrary to it, John Bisbroune and Christopher
passing on the way in a place called the new Close, the man before mentioned*
who did that beastly act, as it is said, before he had done that act passing on
the same way that John and Christopher Bisbrowne were in, and yet going the
same way, as they came fled the way and would not meet them, and then when they
were gone past, he came into the same way again: and near a quarter of a year
before that John Bisbrown, was moved to speak to him and told him that he was
Esau and that the wild nature had head in him, before mentioned, who was one of
them without, who acted contrary to the light, as it is said of them that are
without: and when John Bisbrown spoke to him and told him, he was Esau and that
the wild nature had head in him, then, the witness rose in him, of whom the
report goes, and he did blush, and was shamefully accused in himself, and
could scarce look any friend in the face, and this was near half a year
since, and therefore ye slanderrers would put your slanders upon the Children
of light: with the light you slanderers and all such beasts and beastly acts,
which are of the world, are condemned with the light* from the Children of
light, praises be to the Lord God; for them it does not touch, for in the light
they dwell* and with the light are you comprehended; which light is your
condemnation and with the light we deny all such actions, and your slanders,
who are to be condemned with the light, to the light in all your consciences I
speak which shall witness me eternally* and you condemn and your slanders: and
to you this is the word of the Lord: this is to go abroad into the world, that
they may own their own, among the Esaus and Ismaels, where the wild nature
has head, which is hated of God, and cast out from God, who is light, and all
the Children of light. A coppie of this is to go amongst them, who are wild in
nature like him upon whom the report goes, and all take warning this is the day
of your visitation that are from that generation which is untowards God, ye may
be kept pure and not potted in that which condemns it. And though his name be
Bisbroun^ yet not of the Bisbrowns, that dwe^s in the truth. I charge you all
in the presence of the living God, to walk wisely to stop all slanders and
reports* and in that dwell which condemns them al, and to you this is the word
of the Lord,

This Bisbroun was denied of friends, near a quarter of a year, before any
such accusation was laid to his charge.

John Archer, who has slandered those thou calls Quakers, make it appear, and
prove thy slander, I command thee in the presence of the living God, that he is
one of them, thou scornefully calls Quaker, for them thou slandered with the
thing called Buggerie. If thou can not prove it, acknowledge thy self to be a
slanderer, a backbiter, a rale bearer, and a busie-body, openly to all the
world, for with the Children of light thou art seen, and judged: the thing has
been learched out, and long before about a quarter of a year, there was one of
them you scornfully called Quakers, was moved to tell him he was Esau, and the
wild nature was head in him, and after he fled the way, and would not meet them
whom the world calls Quakers, as John Bisbrown, and his brother, in Arneshead,
who are witnesses against him, upon whom the report goes, and he durst scarce
look any of them in the face whom you scornfully calls Quakers, and this long
before, there was any such report, for we deny him, who are one of your own,
and wild Esau like, who durst scarcely look any of them in the face, whom ye
call Quakers, but fled the way, as many of you do, and such may come hinging
among us, as some of you do but all such we deny, and where any defect is found
amongst such, you would cast it upon them, who dwells in the truth, (as you did
your friend Gilpin) but them it does not touch, but he was not so far, as your
friend Gilpin, who after forsook them, you scornfully call Quakers, and turned
drunkard, and him you published in print, to be a convert, and a firebrand
snatched out of the fire, and one delivered out of Satan's chains, who turned
drunkard, so that there was a warrant granted out for him, an^ he fled upon it,
and this thou Archer, caused to be put in print, to be published in the nation,
and blessed thy God, for thy convert but thy convert, we utterly deny, (whom
thou scornfully nicknames, Quakers) and his practices before mentioned, with
the light he is eternally condemned, which light they dwell in, whom thou
^cornfully calls Quakers: Friends search him, and declare his condition in
writing, and if he will not answer, stick it upon the Cross, that truth may be
exalted, and deceit confounded, for he is one for condemnation, upon whom the
report goes; before the report went of him, one that separate from friends, and
separate from truth long before, whom truth reigns over, and all that are in
it, whom you scornefully call Quakers for there is no other truth, but what
they are in, for it is but one in all, the same as ever was.

Hugh Bisbrown, whom Archer faid was one of the chief heads, was never known
to speak amongst friends, in that way you speak of: for shame stop your mouths
who say he was one of the heads whom Christopher Bisbrown was moved to speak to
his brother about, to keep him from coming among the Lords people while he used
such loose company, some while before he left off coming to meetings. And Alice
Bourrough* was moved to tell him in the power of the Lord, he turned the grace
of God into wantonness, for all his life she saw nothing but looseness in him,
and great hardness of heart, though he came hinging, and loose by sometimes to
meetings.

As for Killner and Fell the two witnesses of James Milners prophecy, that
time, James was denied when his mind was forth where Kilner and Fell is, but
Milner now being recovered from that state which they witness against, for we
witness against those things which he was in, which now he is recoverd out of
which enviously now is published by these two witnesses, whom we witness
against, they being enemies to the truth as it is in Jesus, but these are them
that does report to them that does report and so it is published to the Nation,
by such as does result the truth as Iannes and Iambres did, who has the form
of Godliness but denies the power.

A Paper have I received who writes his name to it Robort Drury, who was a
friend to a man that himself made away. Friend, the lies that the man and his
witnesses spoke in Wollies house we denied, for he heard him not speak these
words which he witnesses, and his witnessing before and so he was a liar, and
they was liars. And thou now seeks to justify a liar, and so it was no slander,
nor no lies in hypocrisy which was written forth for the truths sake, that
they that dwell in the truth, should not be slandered with such a fellow: for
friends being slandered with him after he was dead, for the truths sake it was
written forth. And thou that seek to justify him and his lying witnesses,
take heed of the just judgment of God falling upon thee. And to that in thy
conscience I speak. And him whom the world calls George Fox, did witness the
thing that the lier and the false accuser had said he had spoken before in his
hearing, which he had not spoken the words and so he was a lier, and his
witness false, and thou false, that justifies him. And that in thy conscience
will bear testimony against thee, though after before many witnesses, he did
witness it, but not as carnally spoken, and thou who do now appear in the
same nature, take heed, take warning, for Judas he did see him to be, and Judas
end came to him. And woe to that man that does betray the just and the woe is to
thee, for he was not slandered, who turned from the light and wilfully betrayed
the just, which light is your condemnation, which now seek to justify the
unjust and the betrayer. But in the power of the Lord, we are kept above al
your slanders, and accusations. And William Drury let thy mouth be stopped, and
thy lies covered, the thing whom the world calls George Fox did witness, is
witnessed but he spoke it not as a Carnal creature, if thou this can
receive, thou may, that in thy conscience is his witness, and thy
condemnation. And before many witnesses it was confessed, that which he had not
spoken before him, that witnessed against him, therefore to him it is a lie and
thou art a false accuser, who seeks to justify him; And utters forth hy lies
in hypocrisy for the truths sake was the Note written forth, because friends
were slandered with him after he was dead, and so the mist which thou casts
before peoples eyes, and the dirty stuff which comes out of thee, the truth
cannot be darkened with it. But clearly thou and he is manifested to the
Children of the light. And Judas was his name, and Judas end was scene, and
take thou heed who go about to justify him, for there men see what your
profession is without the substance, And the truth being cleared the witnesses
fled, and thou would not have had Judas, to have had his name then when it
was given him: let that in thy conscience bear testimony and condemn thee,
who would have had him to have had another name, and have made him better then
he was, and there thou may see now what thou have set up. And the godly
friends are not saddened, who are in the Image of God, who see the end of such
as contrary to the light do act, which thou seeks to justify. But the day has
declared his fruits, and thine. Therefore thou have time, now repent, and thy
time prise it, least God suddenly cut thee off. And this is in love to thy
soul, from him who is a friend of it; And that which was writ in the Paper, was
truth, and not a lie, not a slander in it, and that in thy conscience will
bear testimony to it, which is thy condemnation, And that which (him the world
calls) George Fox did speak forth was proved before many living witnesses, and
that which they witnessed, they was liers, for before to them he had not spoken
it. So let that in thy conscience be a witness against thee, to be in the same
nature against the truth as he was who with the light are to be condemned. And
lies, and false accusations and slanders we all deny, for them we see are come
out of thy own Botle, and thither we do return them (which out of thy Paper are
come)therefore* for the truths sake have I written forth a few words to thee,
from them whom by the world are scornfully called Quakers.

The man that cast himself away, he came to a place where there was a meeting
of people. And he was set up of the world, and the world heard him; and he
carried away lies, and brought witnesses to witness with him lies, against one
whom the world calls George Fox; and came into Gainsbrough in Lincolnshire, to
one Edward Wall^es house with his witnesses, where many people were gathered
together, and fauned upon him whom the world calls George Fox, and said he loved
him, but he put him off him and was moved to lay, thou art Judas, and some
people said he should not have done so* the world would nickname him, and still
he was moved to say, he was Judas, and then to manage his lies before the
people, when he was opposed, he called his witnesses, and the witnesses started
up to witness the lies, and then the truth was witnessed by him, though he had
not spoken it before, and the witnesses of the lies fled: but he that was called
Judas, remaineda Judas as the issue of it has made manifest, for no other name
could he that the world calls George Fox, call him by, at that time, but
Judas: and so he was, and has made it manifest, and since the terror has been
upon him, and he came hinging amongst friends for a shelter, but his end was
Judas his end who hanged himself, so he whom the world calls George Fox did not
wrong him, in giving him that name, Judas who brought lies and false witnesses
against the truth, and the innocent. Therefore take warning to you all that
oppose the truth, and cast lies and slanders upon it; you may continue a while,
but destruction is your end, though such may hing among friends for time, and
be partaker of Judas, Ministry, and to cry against the Priests with the same
nature that is in the Priests; with the light that is eternal, both it and
they and them are to be condemned, which light never changes. Therefore to the
light in you all friends did I speak which never changes, that with it your
minds may be kept up to Christ, and God, who never changes: so if you do turn
from the light which never changes, to the changeable, there is the Judas the
Son of perdition, which is condemned with the light, and to you this is the
eternal word of God; And he that turns from the light of Christ, which he
has enlightened him withal, from the unchangeable Priest, to the changable,
he is the Son of perdition, and Judas is his way to perdition, and Christ is
not his way; who turns from the light, turns from Christ, and despaires, and
with the light which comes from Christ he is condemned, but Judas is his way to
perdition. But who dwells in the light, and walks in the light, is led out of
all desperation; which light condemns all the world which hates the light,
and lies in desperation, and doubts: the Jews which had not the life of what
they profess in words, they despaired, and they doubted. Judas when he forsook
Christ, and turned from the light to the changeable Priests, so despaired and
hanged himself; with the light which comes from Christ, is all these things
seen, for this is the condemnation, the light: therefore a warning to you all,
that do prosess what you are not in the life of, Cain when he turned from the
command of God despaired, who was in envy: So all you who lie in envy, and in
Cains way turn from the commands of God, who do despair, and all you that
has the Scriptures and not the life that gave them forth, you doubt and
despair as the Jews did, and all you that turns from the light, which Christ
Jesus has enlightened you withal, whereby you see sin, and evil, and
uncleanness; and so turn in to the evil unto the changeable Priests from the
unchangeable; Judas, is your way to perdition, and not Christ, and to you all,
this is the eternal word of God: to the light of Christ in you all I do speak,
which will witness me, and condemn all you that hate it.

FINIS.
