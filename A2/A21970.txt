By the King.
THe foul and insolent outrages lately committed upon the borders of our
Realms of England and Scotland by persons accustomed in former times to live
by rapine and spoil, praying daily upon our good and loving Subjects without
fear of God or man, has given us just cause to use, all means convenient
both for the relief of our Subjects damnifyed, and for prevention of the like
mischief hereafter. Wherefore as of late we gave commission to proceed
against those persons, that were guilty of those foul facts: So now again,
because as yet such redress has not followed as both our honor and our good
Subjects loss do require, We have thought good to renew that our Commission to
certain persons of quality and of good understanding in the affairs of those
our Borders, And withal, to publish by open proclamation to all men, but
specially to such, as are guilty, or were partakers of the foul incursions
made upon our first coming to our Crown of this our Realm of England, or any
others before or since, That whereas some of them have of late submitted
themselves, and some others seemed to be willing to submit themselves to our
merry, Because they and all others shall know, that as we are a Prince that
before all worldly respects whatsocuer affects the preservation of Justice
among our people, and the punishment of such, as break the Rules thereof, So
that we are not indisposed to show mercy where there is cause to extend it, and
where the same is sought at our hands in such dutiful manner, as is meet: We
do therefore charge all persons whatsoever, who know themselves to have been
Actours, Partners, or of consent to that incursion above mentioned, or to any
other breach of our peace within the Counties and Lymits heretofore called our
Borders both of the English side and of the Scottish, that they do before the
twentieth day of June next coming resort to such place, where they shall
understand our Commissioners to be, and there submit themselves to such mercy
and favor, as we shall think good to extend toward them: Assuring them in
the word of our Royal and Supreme power, that whosoever of them shall not
before the said twentieth day of June have submitted himself according to the
tenor of this our Proclamation, shall hold himself for ever excluded from
our mercy without hope at any time to obtain grace or favor, but to abide the
rigor of such punishment, as our power can lay upon him.

Given at our Manor of Greenwich the seventeenth day of May, 1603. in the
first year of our Reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the
six and thirtieth.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty.
