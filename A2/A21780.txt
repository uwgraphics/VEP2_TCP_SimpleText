By the Queen.
WHereas the Queens Majesty our most gracious sovereign Lady, by reason of
the plague and pestilence, as well in the City of London, as in the City of
Westminster, did lately by her Highness Proclamation adiourne part of the Term
of saint Michael, that is to say, from the vtas thereof, until Mensis
Michaelis, then to have begun at the said City of Westminster, as at the place
accustomed, her Majesty had very great hope that the said sickness, by the
favor of Almighty God, and by the coldenesse of the year, and other
occasions, by that time would have ceased. Nevertheless her Highness being
credibly informed, that the said sickness increases within the said Cities of
London and Westminster, is therefore minded for the better preservation of her
good Subjects of all degrees, that should repair to London and Westminster by
reason of the Term, to adiourne the said Term from Mensis Michaelis
aforesaid, until the return of the same Term, commonly called Crastino
Martini, next coming, then to begin at Westminster as has been accustomed.
Which her Majesty signifies to all and singular her loving subjects of this
her Realm, to the intent, that they, and every of them, which has cause or
commandment to appear in any of her highness courts at Westminster, on, or
at any day or time, from, and after the said Mensis Michaelis, may tarry at
their dwellings, or where their business otherwise shall lie, without
resorting to any of the said Courts for that cause, before the said the said
return of Crastino Martini next coming, and that without danger of
forfeiture, penalty, or contempt, to incur toward her Majesty in that
behalf. And nevertheless ber Highness pleasure is, that two of her Justices,
that is to say, of either bench one, shall the said Mensis Michaelis, according
to the ancient order, adiourne her said two Courts at Westminster, at which day
writtes of adiournement shall be directed to the said Justices, to adiourne the
same, in and from the said Mensis Michaelis, until the said return of
Crastino Martini, as before is said: And her Majesty's pleasure is, that all
matters causes and suites, depending in any of her other Courts between party
and party, as in her Highness Courts of Chancerie, Star chamber, and
Exchequer, Courts of wards and liueries, and Duchy of Lancaster, shall have
continuance, and the parties shall have day from the date of these presents
until the said return of Crastino Martini as before is said,

Provided always, and her Majesty's pleasure and commandment is, that all
Collectors, Receivers, Sheriffs, and other accomptants, and all other persons
that ought or should account or pay any sum or sums of money in any of her
Majesty's court of Exchequer, courts of wards and liueries, or of her Duchy of
Lancaster, or any of them, or to enter into any account in any of the said
courts, shall at their days appointed, repair unto the accustomed places at
Westminster, where her Highness has appointed such officers ministers, as for
that purpose her Majesty has thought expedient, and there to pay, and do in
every behalf, as though no such Proclamation of adiournement had been had or
made, any thing mentioned in this Proclamation, or in any wirt of adiournement
to the contrary, notwithstanding. And her Highness further pleasure and
commandment is, that all Sheriffs shall return their Writtes and Process
against all such accomptants and debtors at the bares therein appointed. And if
any person or persons who ought to account or pay any sum or sums of money
to her Majesty in any the said Courts and places aforesaid, do make default
therein, That then her Highness Writtes and Process shall be awarded, and sent
forth against every such person and persons, and the same to be duly and
orderly served and returned by, the Sheriffs and Officers thereunto appointed,
in such like manner and form as the same should have been, if this present
proclamation had not been made. And if any Sheriff or other Officer shall make
default, or be negligent in serving, executing and returning any the said
writtes and Process aforesaid: That then every such Sheriff and other Officer
shall incur such pains and penalties, as by the said Courts, or any of them
shall be taxed and assessed: Willing and commanding all and every her Majesty's
Sheriffs, officers, ministers and subjects, to whom it does or shall
appertain, to observe and keep their assemblies and appearances, with all
their returns and certificats in her Highness said Courts at Westminster, in
the said return of Crastino Martini, next coming, then and there with the
favor of God, to be holden and kept, and there to do their offices and duties
in every behalf, in like manner and form as they should or ought to have done,
I this present Proclamation had not been had or made, as they will answer to
the contrary at their perils.

Given at her Majesty's Manor of Richemond the xx. day of October, in the
twentieth year of our Reign.
Imprinted at London by Christopher Barker, Printer to the Queens Majesty.
