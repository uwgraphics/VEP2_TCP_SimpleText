Antipus,
To hear of such things ye be not wont
Nam horum contraria verissima sunt

AS verily as Adam created first his God
So verily he tasted not, the fruit that was forbod
As verily as Abell, did kill his brother Kayn
So verily the ship made Noye this is plain
As verily as Isaac, his father did begette
So verily the Sodomytes remayn unburned yet
As verily as the Isralites, the Egiptians did oppress
So verily did Moses give God the law dowbtles
As verily as Sampson was, slain of the lion rampynge
So verily did Goliad distroye David the King
As verily as in Babylon the meats were eat of Bell
So verily the dragon of brass devoured Daniell
As verily as Christ did crucifye the Jews
So verily the Aposteles the gospel did refuse
As verily as Simon Magus the Apostles did confute
So verily the Apostels did princes persecute
As verily as the devil has perfect love and hope
So verily gods word does constitute the pope
As verily as Ise sicles within be hot and holowe
So verily proud prelates our master Christ do follow
As verily as bread does make and bake the baker
So verily these thefes the prestes can make their maker.
If Leighton will neades his maker make
That these are true he can not forsake
A Papiste he is and the popes own knight
That preaches falshed in stead of right
He knowith not how to pay his dettes
But with catchinge his creditors in the Popes netts
A thief, a robber, by preachinge sedition
Is better regarded then the kings commission.
Among Papists.
