OBSERVATIONS UPON The ensuing LETTERS.
THe Lords and Commons have commanded these ensuing Letters and Notes to be
printed, The copy of a Letter written by the Lord Digby to the Queen the 10. of
March last, of his own handwriting: An original Letter written to the Lord
Digby by Mr. (...). (...). (...) from York the 27. of May (...), two notes of
Arms, the one of which is partly His (...) own hand, both found among my Lord
(...) papers: In the Letter of the Lord Digby to the Queen, it may be
observed, how he discovers his venomous heart to this Kingdom, in that (...)
censure, that we are a Country unworthy of her; unworthy (...) to be (...)
often designed to (...) and (...) to be undermined and circumvented by so many
plots and devilish projects of Jesuits and Priests and other the most (...)
and Malignant (...) in Christ endome; by which we had been (...) ruined and
destroyed, if Gods wonderful (...) had not preserved us: And we call his
divine (...) to (...) that we have never done any thing against the (...) or
Honor of her (...) only we have desired to be (...) such plots from such
(...), that they might not have the favor of the Court and such a (...) upon
his Majesty's Counsels, as they have had to (...) not (...) of the Civil
(...), and (...) Kingdom; but of that which we hold dearer much then (...),
yea then the very being of this Nation, our Religion, (...) depends the honor
of Almighty God, and salvation of our Souls: Let this Lord, who was long
amongst us, and (...) the Grounds of our proceedings and most (...), produce
any thing ((...)) (...) or (...) to her (...), (...) or (...) by us.

Another (...) in the Letter is this (...) this (...) that he writ to his
Majesty with the hardiness which (...) thought his affairs and complexion
(...), what this was may well be (...) in a Letter from himself to the Queen
(...) by our (...), his (...) in the (...) Lord (...) that he should withdraw
himself (...) his Parliament (...) himself to some place of strength, (...)
the Counsel he then (...) him, and how well it has (...) every man may (...),
but what his Majesty's (...) required, that (...) a greater (...), and (...)
this may be collected out of that Letter, that his Majesty (...) the
apprehension of this Lord, was too inclinable to an Accommodation with his
Parliament, which (...) a kind of (...) that Letter is called the (...) or the
(...) way, this complexon so (...) a good Prince, required such a hardy and
vehement provocation to wrath and War against his subjects, as this Lord
presumed to express in that Letter, and besides his (...) to the Kingdom, we
may herein observe a great degree of insolence and contempt toward his
Majesty, that he should (...) in a Letter to the Queen to tax his (...) with
so much as mildnes toward his people must needs (...) such hardy and bold
Counsel.

In Master (...) Letter it may be (...) observed, that whilst his (...)
contests with his Parliament for some questionable (...) concerning the
Commonwealth his own (...) do really (...) him of an undoubted Prerogative of
(...) the sovereign disposer of favors and (...) in his (...), which this
Gentleman does express in that (...) to have any place about his Majesty but
by the (...) and may be further observed what these desperate (...) about the
King are most afraid of, and what they think most (...) to themselves, that
his Majesty (...) be inclined to an accommodation with his people; by this
(...) to be undone, that is, to loose that prey, the (...) of the
Parliament Men, and other good subjects, which they have already devoured in
their own (...), and that they (...) to be (...) from this undoing by the
Queens (...).

By these two Notes may be (...), that at the (...) so many Declarations were
published in his Majesty's Name, with solemn Protestations of his Maiestics
Intentions of raising (...) a Guard for his own person, all sorts of provision
for an Army, were made beyond the Seas, and this poor Kingdom designed to the
(...) and confusion of War, and under the disguise of defending the
Protestant profession, an Army to be raised in the Intention of these wicked
Counselors, (...) suppressing and (...) of the (...) Religion.

The Lord Digbyes Letter to the Queens Majesty.
Hague, March the 10. 1642. MADAM,
IT is the first Contentment that I have been (...) of this long (...)) That
Your Majesty is safely arrived in HOLLAND, Withdrawn from a Country so
unworthy of you.

I should have waited the first upon you, both to have tendered my duty
according to my (...) of obligation above others, and to have (...) your
Majesty the (...), of the state of this place, whither you are coming, both
in point of (...) and (...), but that there (...) about such reports that the
Parliament has desired (...) Majesty not to admit me to your presence, as I
dare not presume into it (...). The ground of their malevolence toward me in
this (...), is said to be, upon some Letters, which they have Presumed to
open, (...) unto your Majesty from me, which I prof (...) I cannot apprehend,
for I am certain, that I have not written to your Majesty the least (...)
that can be (...) to an ill (...), by my greatest enemies, having not so much
as mentioned any business to your Majesty since I left England. To the King I
confess I wrote once with that hardiness which I thought his affairs and
complexion required, but that (...) was sent by so safe hands, as I (...) the
(...) of it. However MADAM, if my (...) be so great, as that I must be deprived
of the sole comfort of my life, of waiting on Your Majesty, and following your
(...), I (...) you, (...) my (...) be so signified unto me, as (...) I (...)
with the least shame, that well may be, to bewail my (...), which yet will be
(...), if I may be but assured that (...) that generons and Princely heart
preserves me the place of

(MADAM,) Your Majesty's most faithful, and most affectionate humble servant

Mr. Ellyots Letter to the Lord Digby.
My LORD,
YOu have ever been so willing to oblige, that I cannot despair of your favor
in a business wherein I am much concerned, the King was pleased to employ me
to London to my Lord Keeper for the Seals, which though after two hours
consideration he refused, yet beirg resolved not to be denied, my importunity
at last prevailed, which service the King has declared was so great, that he
has promised a reward equal to it; it may be the King expects I should move
him for some place, which I shall not do, being resolved never to have any but
by the Queen, being already so infinitely obliged to her sor her favors, that I
confess I would (...) my being only to her; nor shall I (...) value that life
I hold, but as a debt, which I shall (...) to her commands; the favor which I
desire from your (...), is, that you willing age the Queen to write to the
Kirg, that he would make a Groom of his Bedchamber, which since I know (...)
so absolutely in her power to do, I shall never think of an other way, for
which favor neither her Majesty nor your Lordship shall ever find a more
real servant, for our affairs they are now in so good a condition, that if we
are not undone by harkning to an Accommodation, there is nothing else can hurt
us, which I fear the King is too much inclyned to, but I hope what he shall
receive from the Queen, will make him so resolved, that nothing but a
satissaction equal to the injuries he has received, will make him quit the
advantage he now has, which I do not doubt will be the means of bringing your
Lordship quickly hither, where you shall find none more ready to obey your
Commands,

York the 27. of May, 1642. Then your most faithful and humble servant, THOM.
ELLYOT.
