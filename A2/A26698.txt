ABOUT Mending the COIN.
It appearing the Interest as well as the Desire of the KING and his People,
That some Regulations should this Sessions be made in the COIN, and the Sense
of many that have it, that the Loss by Clipped Money, in some measure occasioned
by Public Connivance, should be by the Public made good, as well as the
Standard Preserved; That is, what Silver is Coined should so be (as hither to
has been) at 5 s. and 2 d. per Ounce, being what will be most for preserving
the Honor of England, and most for the Interest of His Majesty, and the Head
Owners of Lands in the point of Revenue and Rents, and that this may be done
with more Justice, Ease, and less Expense to the Nation then it can by Raising
the Standard, and making more Money by Tale from a Pound of Silver, then by the
present Standard is allowed to be made, and that as to what relates to Foreign
Trade, an Ounce of Silver, call it what you will, is but an Ounce, and will
purchase no more in a great many Pieces than in few, and that by being so made
into fewer Pieces, 'twill not be kept longer from being carried abroad, and
that as much Silver will be brought to be Coined when the Old Standard shall so
anew be Established, that no Money debased by Clipping or otherwise, shall
longer pass in the Kingdom, are Positions if contradicted in Print, they soon
will, and may be easy in Print (having been so already) maintained, and that
the Difficulties to be feared in effecting this matter, with Honor,
Satisfaction, and Justice to all Parties concerned, and without Interruption of
Trade, and with as little Expense to the Nation, as a thing of this nature can
be, may no way obstruct the Trying to do it at this time,

It Is PROPOSED,
1. THat a Fund of 50000 l. yearly (to which the late House of Commons seemed
willing) should be settled to make good the Loss, which cannot well he conceived
to amount to what the said 50000 l. yearly will (in the manner hereafter
Proposed) make good, and some easy Fund may be found for it.

2. That a Million of Money (which also may this way be easily raised) in Clipped
Half Crowns, be sunk by a Lottery, which it is believed will take them all up;
and if that it be Enacted, That such shall be taken for Tickets, and that no
person shall be obliged to take any Clipped Half Crowns (any otherwise than by
Weight) after Three Months, they all will come tumbling in, and the Owners of
them will be pleased, having a Courtesy done them. Supposing such Allowance in
the Lottery given, that every Adventurer shall be no Looser by it, which 40 s.
yearly for each 10 l. paid in for each Ticket will do, and so few Prizes over
(and without any Rebate) will encourage its filing; That whereas 40000 l.
yearly, (besides a Rebate) for a Sixteen years Term, worth 300000 l. to bring
in the Money was allowed as a Gift in the last, a bare 50000 l. in Money, put
into a 1000 Fifty pound Prizes, will be sufficient to do it in this, and a Fund
may be easy found for it.

3. That the rest of the Clipped and Silver Money, Sixpences and Shillings,
should be received by the King (as now it is) in all Loans and Payments
whatsoever, to be made in the Exchequer, for Six Months after the Three allowed
for the Half Crowns, and that nothing but Silver Money (as now it is) should
during that time, be taken for Taxes by the Crown. This will in that time bring
it all into the Exchequer, if that it be made public, That His Majesty will
not, and that no other shall be obliged to take it (but by weight) afterward;
this will keep it Current for public Convenience, for so long as the King
takes it, and will make the Owners willingly part with it to the Public, that
it may not remain, and afterward fall in their Hands.

This leaves not the least room for Complaint, every Owner of Clipped Money
having opportunity given him to part with it, without Loss if he will* and so in
no sort will give Discontent, nor prove any way Prejudicial to the Current
Trade of the Nation, but on the contrary, bring out the heavy Money laid up of
late, in hope that the Standard would be raised; which (in case it be not by
Authority) will go for no more than its weight, and whilst this is doing, so
much New Money, from the old Melted down, will be Coined, as with the help of
the Old Money unclipt, will serve for the Public Convenience, and not
interrupt Trade in the least.

Now to this 'twill be presently said,

If your Money now Current be allowed so long to pass, as before is proposed,
the Clipping Trade still will go on. To which it may be answered, and so 'twill
if nothing be done, and the inconvenience that would accrue to the People in
general, if the Currancy of it were stopped all at once would certainly be
greater by much. And

To this it will further be said,

If the King takes the Million in half Crowns, Proposed to be raised by the
Lottery as a good Million of Money, and the other One or Two Millions (tho I
cannot think so much will be) in the other Clipped Money, as good: Whereas in
value it may not, (it may be) arise to above Three fifths, one with another of
it: that is, supposing every Million so received not worth above 600000 l. What
shall the King do, if he may not pay it out at the rate he received it, for the
other 400000 l. which will of such Million be wanting?

Note, By this Proposal his Majesty's Affairs need not to be disappointed, nor
to suffer at all in the least, since it may be avoided thus:

Let the Money so received by the Crown from the Lottery, half Crowns and
otherwise in Clipped Money be, (by Sworn Officers on purpose appointed) melted
down and assayed, and then by Weight and Fineness delivered to the National
Land Bank, or other trusty Persons for that purpose to be appointed: and for
every Hundred Pounds (reckoned at the Standard the Money shall be Coined at)
that shall be wanting of what 'twas taken by the King at, by Tale, let 5 l.
yearly, out of the aforesaid 50000 l. yearly, be settled (till paid off by
Parliament,) which will fully enable such Bank, or other Persons entrusted, to
answer the King his full and whole Money by Tale, as fast as he will draw it upon
them; and the Money so Melted, may, and must forthwith be Coined; and thus this
may be done with all Justice and Ease, as aforesaid.
