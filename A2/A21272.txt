Catanea. Set forth this present year By Edm. Eluiden Gentleman.

CVM PRIVILEGIO

To the right honorable Edward Deuiere, lord Boulbecke, Earl of Oxford, Lord
great Chamberlain of England, Edmund Eluiden wishes long life with increase
of honor.
IT was not with out wise forecaste right honorable (that the polytike Poets
and wise Philosophers, have many times uttered in pleasant Metaphors, hidden
secrets and sundry notable instructions, considering that as the mind is
satisfied with profound mysteries, so likewise the weakness of nature is made well
disposed by pleasant conueiance: for as the one informing wisdom, burdeneth
the wits, so likewise the other refreshes the senses, renews the memory,
and preserves the tender appetite from tediousness: which requisite recration
of me presumptuously thought upon, I have boldlye or rather impudentely offered
to your honor this present rude and gross conceit, wherein I have to my
slender ability bestowed the fruits of my willing labor, for your honors
recreation and avoiding of tedious time, after your wayghtie affayrs finished,
not altogether void of secret meaning, but well perused of your Lordshippe,
sufficiently intending to satisfy the humor of your wise disposition. And
thus craving your courtesy to respect of my good will, as chiefly bent for your
especial pleasure, rather than of my simple travel, I briefly leave to trouble
your honor with tedious circumstance.

Your honors humble at commandment, Edmund Eluiden.

To the Reader.
THere is no Soil so baren (gentle Reader) but being wisely used, will yield
some commodity: In like case nothing so unpolished but may be somewhat adorned.
Wherefore, boldly let me crave thy patience to accept this my simple
endeavor: and it shall be the ready way to encourage a gros conceit to somewhat
better fertility. In the mean season take this present simple gift as for thy
recreatio^, meaning well, and the better if thou conceive thereof vprightlye: in
readyng therefore, peruse and perusing, take that thou think for acceptable,
and that which thou iudgest weak, let thy good will ratifye: and so doing thou
shall justly recompense my travel, the which though it be simple, requires
rather the judgment of the gentle, than the praise of the slanderous, or
sentence o^ the captious. Farewell.

The Argument.
IN Grecian soil two brothers born there is,
they father have Agenetos, whose blis,
In happy time the children had attainde:
the father died, and valiant sons remainde.
The eldest son he Kened^xus hight,
the other namde Pesi^tr^tus, they fight
With ancient foes, who Tetimetians callde,
were (caitifs al) to martial brothers thralde:
And conquest got, the brothers fall to strife,
for spoil of foes, whereon each seeks the life
(In pointed place) of other to suppress:
Pesistrate conqueror departs, and in distress
He brother leaves, whose fatal wou^d he thought
with cursed blade his cruel hand had wrought
Whereon into Italian parts he flies,
and well retainde, a seemly Lady spies,
Whom loving long, the joyful man at last
his Ladies love attainde, his dollors past.
From ruling room then Kenedox deprivde
in native soil, to Tarent town ^rivde,
Where brother was: of treason he accusde
the Lovers both: and Champion not refusde,
In combat fought: the Kenedox was slain,
and lovers thus were rid from former pain
Then Champion dead, was Pesistrate exild
from Ladies sight, whose changed robes beguild
His foes despite: the^ proclamation made
that Pesistrate to proper soil should vade,
He there ariude prepared a valiant host,
wherewith returnde into Italian coast.
He slew the fo in open chalengde fight,
that erst had wrought the troubled man such spite
And Lady woonne, he took her to his mate,
and livde at ease, and did in happy state.
The History of Pesistratus and Catanea.
IN fertile fruitful happy soil
which Grecia has to name,
And pleasant Appollonia land
contained in the same,
There flourished the courtly race
of A^anetians kind,
Which stained every hauty blood
in valor of the mind:
And in the midst, when flickering fame
had spread her self to praise,
To Aganetians did amount
more happy golden days.
For when Aganetos, the chief
of Aganetians rout,
Began to leave his youthful years,
proceeding to misdoubt:
So fortune favored his case,
that he possess the gain,
Whose want, had long dismayed his sense
and causde him to complain.
And from Veronia, whom he chose
to be his matched mate,
There did proceed two goodly imps,
which glorified his fate.
And after his decease, when death
incroched on his years,
They did renew their fathers fame,
and had not then their peers.
For when the perilous dispatch
of childish age was spent,
In no misorder, but in use
which dangers does preuente
And they approcht unto the time
when season does indue
The sense with reason, and the wights
which reason do ensue,
These youthful Knights did tracke the steeps
that sire had trod before,
In such an ample valiant sort,
as they could do no more.
One Kenedoxus, the other eke
he Pesistratus high,
The youngest last whose fame my pen
does purpose to indite,
Who chiefly through his valor great,
so satisfied the sire,
That Pesistratus to preser
the father did desire.
And therefore when as crooked age
did one rate his back,
And he oppressed with faint disease,
did feel of force the lack,
He calls to him these brothers twain,
who present thus he said:
(But to the elder first his speech
and meaning he conuayd:)
Thou Kenedoxus know well
the Aganetians fame,
And to be Aganetian^ heir
thou loo^est for the same:
And since it is thy right, my son,
I grant thou shall enjoy
The very same, without my let,
disturbance or anoy:
But oh my well-beloved babes,
consider in your brain,
How I have labored for your wealth
and for your propre gain,
In seeking to suppress the foes
which gape for the dispoyle
Of Aganetians, unto whom
I always gave the foil.
I mean the Tetimetians, they,
who burn in furies fire,
To have on Aganetians blood
the full of their desire.
But what conflicts and combats fierce,
it needs not to be shown,
Has bin betwixt my self and them,
for it is well yknowne.
Now this is my request my sons,
your prowess may uphold
The fame, which Tetimetians have
so derely to me sold,
For well I do perceive, because
there is two springals sprung
From Tetimetians, you shall feel
their wrath ere it be long:
And therefore warily provide,
and manfully pretend,
In all their fierce assaults, your selves
with courage to defend:
Whereof, not only you shall reap
immortal happy praise,
But also g^ine a quiet state,
attaining to the stays
Which nere your predecessors could
before you yet possess.
But ever, for your sakes, have lived
in werisome distress:
And for because your stomachs might
in no wise seem to fail,
Nor once your hearts, in your defense
and quarrel for to quail,
I will declare to you, the cause
from whence began this strife.
Which has endured, ever since
the entrance of my life.
When Turkish nation did assay
our Appollonia soil,
To bring the same unto decay,
and to a shameful foil,
Tetimetians auncester by craft
and treason did conspire,
Unto the Turks against the same,
for privy prouling hire:
Which, when your graundsire Aganes
perceived to be so,
How Tetime by treason wrought,
and was so great a fo
Against his native country (movde
by nature to the same)
He brought before the armed rout,
this ^etimes to shame:
For there in open audience he
his treason did discry,
Which done he offered to approve
the m^tter by and by,
Whereas in open sight, by force
this Tetimes he slew,
And after slain, his traiterous corpse
upon a dunghill drew.
Which when the chieftaines viewed well
of Aganes his might.
And how the traitor he had slain
in maintenance of right.
They al consented and agreed,
your graundsire should possess
Tetimes heritage, wherein
be took a firm release,
And Aganetians ever since
baue so inioyde the same,
Whereon the Tetimetians most
their malice do proclayme.
Thus know you all the full effect
(my children) of the cafe,
And therefore s^eke you to insew
your grauns^ers former raze.
But unto thee Pesistratus,
with fatherly consent,
I give my bliss, as much as of
a father may be meant:
And will thee only, to maintain
the Aganetians fame,
And to revenge these foes dispight,
unto their further shame:
And whatsoever either of you
by force of foes attain,
I will it do redownd to thee,
as for a rightful gain.
And so be stint, and gushing tears
proceeded from his eyes
Upon his breast, like dropping dewes
descending from the skies:
And force did faint, and wavering life
was up and down y^ost,
Til at the last in happy time
he yielded up his ghost.
But, when to brothers did appear
their fathers mourneful death.
With roaring voice and shryking cries,
and sighs and sobbing br^ath,
And woeful houlings, plaintes, and tears,
and piteous mones, they spend
Their youthful days, in ruful sort
unto a paineful end.
But in a season, when the rage
of burning did aslake,
(Whereby the boylings did delay)
they did begin to make
The rich and solemn funerals,
(according to the use)
Of fathers carcass, meet for earth,
which done without abuse,
With all things incident thereto,
the brothers, though dismayed
Through death of ^ire, yet did devise
how each thing might be stayed:
But Pesistratus, cheefely movde
by nature to the same,
To brother Kenedoxus, thus
his speech began to frame:
Though we unhappy have great cause
with tears us to complain,
Yet season (brother) seems to crave
we should therefore refrain,
And though it be both natural
and duty we do so*
Yet is it needeful to surmise
on furies of our fo:
And therefore, sorrow set a side,
and pensiveness from heart,
Let lustye bloods of Aganes
be ^old to do their part,
In seeking to maintain the fame,
the honor and renown,
Which Aganetians here^ofore
have gained, as a crown,
Wherein you seized, must possess
the profits of their toil,
And therefore most had need to care
herein, and most to moyle:
And I as duty does me bind,
and ^athers sweet request,
To maintnance of my brothers wealth,
am always ready pressed.
And though our father now deceast,
is so for ever gone,
Yet let our fathers streite precepts
be always thought upon:
And since his greatest charge was this,
that we, deuoyde of blame,
Should maintain ancestors renoume,
and put our foes to shame,
As needful now, let mutual brains
suppose upon the case,
That we may both avoid our pain,
and beautify the raze
Of former Aganetians, who
have vsd^ their former care,
That we successors unto them,
may likewise partly bear
The fruiteful flower of their fame:
thus doing may we say,
Our ancestors have well begone,
and we have made the slay:
But otherwise, if we should slack
our duties to prefarre,
They should not be so much a fame
to us, but we a scarre
To them, and those which shall ensue
of Aganetians blood,
Who after us, may rightly say,
we never did them good.
It Is true, quoth Kenedoxus then,
I grant to your desire,
And gentle brother to these things,
I willingly aspire:
And therefore, as our fathers will,
of you so likewise I
Do crave, these matters to dispose,
and I shall naught deny,
But urge my tra^el, to pursue
the force of your advise,
From whence I doubt not, but the proof
of profit will arise.
And thus these brothers do conclude
their talk, and now begin
To follow the effects thereof:
whom I will leave herein,
And unto Tetimetians rage
my pen and I must bend,
For to discry the mind at large,
and matter they intend.
THe Tetimetians waying well
how every thing does s^and,
And how Agenetes is dead,
and they of stronger hand,
And how the brothers be the chief
of Aganetians route,
Whereon they gather less suspect
or m^^ion of misdoute,
In fell and furious ranckrous rage
so fiercely they abound,
That now in haste, but al in wast,
they hope straight to confound
The Aganetians, and proceed
in wrathfulnesse and ire,
By sundry shifts and secret crafts
to work the said desire.
But Anteres, the principal
of Tetimetians, be
Pervsing better of the case
than all the rest could see,
Amongst the midst, began with voice
amounting, thus to say:
My friends and Neuews, be attent
to that I shall display:
The Aganetians (as you know)
the quarrel do defend,
And we desirous of revenge,
the quarrel do extend:
Now, since the quarrel is our own,
and that we seek our fame,
We ought to challenge them, as so
we get no further shame:
And therefore note what I intend,
I have (as you do know)
Two sons proceeded from my loins,
who daily seem to grow
And to increase in prowes great,
and these shall challenge those,
I mean the brothers, which disc^^d
from parties of our foes,
In meet appointed place to prove
that Tetimes was slain
By treason false, of Aganes,
who falsely did it feign,
And if the brothers do consent
to come in poynted place,
And dare presume to meet my sons
and look them in the face,
We will ordain the chiefest strength
of al our noble blood,
To help my sons, if ought should chance
to them more worse than good:
And by this means, as by a shift
when they are present there,
We shall the Aganetians all
suppress, deuoyde of fear.
To this, the Tetimetians glad,
were very well agreed.
And therefore, shortly to conclude,
it briefly was decreed
Of all the Tetimetian route,
that challenge should be made
Of Tetimetian brothers, who
consenting, causde to vade
A verlet dight in posting haste,
to Aganetians train,
Who did inform them of this thing,
and then returnde again.
But none amidst the valiant route
of Aganetians, more,
Than Aganetian brothers ioyde,
to hear of this before.
For it was chiefly that they wished,
and therefore did provide
Each requisite and needful thing
for the appointed tide.
And not unlike to Lions fierce.
who rage for want of pray,
They burnd and boylde in furies fire,
til the appointed day,
The which approcht, the furious youths
be met in foresaid field,
With barbed horse and steely cotes,
and blade and spear and shield,
And after course of rankrous talk,
with staff in steady wreast,
Each youth appointed, for his foe
is now already pressed.
And traitorous Tetimetians they,
as erst they did devise,
Were in ambushment privy hid
in secret, so likewise
The Aganetians eke, unknown
did closely couche in place,
Where they suspecting of their foes
and of the foresaid case
Did lie, their nephews to defend,
if reason should assail
To work them mischief, wherein much
their watching did prevail:
For when each youthful knight had met
and buckled with his foe,
Like thunder rattling in the skies
which tumbleth to and fro,
At last the Tetimetians force
began to fainte and fail,
The which when Aganetians spide,
more fiercely did assail
Their foes, with ouercharging thwackes
til Tetimetians route
Espying those their nephews fare,
in have did rushe them out
From bushes, like to buskling boares,
upon the brothers twain
Of Aganetian kind, and thought
the brothers to have slain:
But Aganetians likewise hid,
as furiously do meet,
From covert bushes, these their foes,
in their defense to greet,
And now begins the stir a new,
for every man does strain
Himself with all his force and might,
to put his foe to pain,
But most surpassing all the rest,
the prowess, and renown
Of Pesistratus did excel,
who so suppressed down
The rage of Tetimetians pride,
that through his Martial might
And manly courage, to conclude,
they put their foes to flight.
And then in better peace, than erst
when they sustaynde anoy.
They did retire, with happy hearts
and stomachs stuffed with joy,
But woe to Fortunes tickle wheels,
who seems to advance,
When with her froward kicking heels
she charmeth a mischaunce:
Thou blubbered blind and bleared ^yde,
thou fond and fickle fool,
Thou thrice and thriee accursed Wench,
thou girl of Momus schole,
Why does thy sausie finger touch
these manly Martial knights?
Why do thou so infect these youths
with thy impoysned spightes*
Art thou not thrall: not thrall ywis:
does fortune each thing guide?
Why then, alas, attend to hear
of this unhappy tide.
The Aganetians thus returnde
from former fearful broyle,
The conquest got, by knightly force
in giving foes the foil,
In season after sweet repast
received, they devise
And mutually consented now,
they purpose to surmise,
How that the spoil they have obtaynd
of foes, may parted be
Amongst them selves, and hereupon
they seek for to agree.
But when as Kenedoxus viewde
this purpose and intent,
In hope to have the whole himself
and all the rest prevent.
With forced voice and fyled tongue,
and hawtie glozing style,
He movde his speech as thus, and cravde
attentiveness a while:
You valiant impes and worthy limbs
of Aganetians raze,
Considering what you do intend
and purpose in this case,
I think my self the boldlier may
proceed for to declare
Such certain things, as to be shown
both good and needeful are.
You know, of Aganetians I
by duty do retain
The lands and lordships, which by right
to me the heir remain:
And now because we have of foes
by force possessed a spoil,
Wherein, more lands we purchaste have
contained in this soil,
It seems requisite to me,
that I possess the same,
Because thereby it may enlarge
the Aganetians fame.
For if our lands should be dispersed
and not in one man's use,
In tract of time it would return
unto our own abuse:
And therefore note what I shall say,
let me the land possess,
And what your parts amount unto,
I will the same address
With ready paiments into gold,
how answer you to this?
None answerde but Pesistratus,
who said it were amiss
That he should seem so to incroche
upon the same, whose right*
Was due to him by Sires bequest,
if foes were won by fight.
Which when the Aganetians wayd.
remembering it for true,
That by the fire it was disposde
for Pesistratus due,
With one accord they did consent,
that Pesistratus, he
Should it enjoy, as fathers will
has granted it to be.
But Kenedoxus movde to wrath,
with swelling face for ire,
Did brast out these unseemly words,
and no wise would aspire:
What value more has bin resinde
from Pesistratus part?
Or manly prowess, than of me
and of my willing heart?
Or why should such unequal dole
be offered for my pain?
Since I my care, as much as he,
have used for to maintain
The Aganetians worthy fame,
whose worthiest heir am I,
And therefore hold it greatest skorne,
that you should so deny
To render me my rightful due,
or strongly to withhold,
My proper right, it likewise seems,
my brother is to bold:
Not bold, quoth Pesistratus then,
in seeking for mine own,
But you to bold in wresting mine
as it is well yknowne.
Which words when Kenedoxus heard,
with hautie spiteful heart
He left them all, and rancrous full
did furiously depart.
Repairing to his chamber, where
deuold of quiet rest,
His raging brains unbridled boil
in fierce Alectos breast,
And fuming in the furious fits
which madness intertaine,
As one distraught of sense and wits,
he puts himself to pain,
In raging for to seek revenge
in most despightful wise
On Pesistratus, whose disease
he ceaseless does devise.
But Aganetians musing much
at K^nedoxus tag^,
And Pesistratus seeing it,
desirous to aswage
The same, with leave requested, hies
to Kenedox in have,
Where as approcht, his brother spies
to mumble very fast
Unto himself with railing voice
on Pesistratus, who
Perceiving Kenedox, as mad
to rail upon him so,
Had entering, thought by gentle words
to molifie his ire,
But Kenedoxus seeing him,
avoid and come no nyer
Quoth he, for (villain) I will seek
as much thy great defame,
As thou have sought, in open sight
of friends to work my shame.
Yet Pesistratus (courteous knight)
replide to him again
With gentle kind of humble speech,
and sought for to refrain
Himself from wrath: but Kenedox
so furiously was bent
Against Pesistratus, that fraught
with fierce and fell intent,
He drew from secret sheath, as wo^^,
his desprate testie blade,
Wherewith on Pesistratus, he
so fiercely did invade,
That had not Pesistratus slept
from chamber door in have,
His courteous heart of brothers blade
had felt th unsavory taste.
But Pesistratus viewing this,
with Rapior bad in hand,
Returned again to brothers face
his rigor to withstand:
And movde by this occasion just
to anger, caitife vile
(Quoth he) would thou in brothers blood
so cowardly defile
Thy filthy fistes? and art thou meant
to seek thy friends decay?
If so, in a convenient place
and on appointed day
Agree to get revenge, and seek
thy quarrel to renew,
And I this blade in traitorous blood
of thine shall there imbrue:
Wherewith each party did consent
in poynted place to meet.
And when the season was approchte,
as time does swiftly fleet,
These youths are met, provided both,
according to the time,
With spear and shield, and bloody blade,
to tell each others crime,
Not with the tongue, but Martial fist,
in such unfriendly sort,
As each did judge his foe, no friend,
or for to play in sport:
But now began the broyle so hot,
that who had seen the blows,
The deadly thrustes, the desperate foynts
that each to other shows,
The battring bangs, and thumping thwacks
that each to other lent,
With stained field, of brothers blood
so carelessly dispent,
He would have jest surmysde, that these
should natural brothers be,
But rather friends of Cerberus kind,
or impes of Hels decree:
So furious fiersly did they deal,
without remorse of life,
Or nature, but respecting naught
save cause of former strife,
Like Tigres fastening on their pray*
the sought each others death,
Til both had labored with such pain
that they were out of breath:
And then they breathd and fought afresh,
and breathde and fought again,
And never stint, til at the last
there came with might and maine
A great convent of armed knights,
who had in forest by
Bin chasing, through their martial feats
a dragon monstrous hie,
And of proportion wonderful,
who long had brought to spoil
The corn and cattle therabout
contained in their soil.
And when the knights had from a far
espide these brothers fell,
Each so assaulting others life
with bloody blade to quell:
With pricking spur, they forward forced
their bodies to be borne.
And when approcht, they viewde the knights
so batterd, taggde and torn
With dint of sword, it was no boot
to bid them forward hie
To part the foes, for it was done
in twinkling of an eye.
But Kenedoxus what through heat
and want of breathing wind,
And what through faintness of his wounds,
he to the earth declinde
As dead, for Pesistratus had
impierst with cruel thrust,
His shoulder through, whom when he viewd
to grouel in the dust
His heavy heart was so aghast
and he in dumpes dismayde,
Because he thought his brother dead,
that thus with tears he said:
O lucklesse wight, oh cursed youth,
and has this this my fist
My brother slain? and shall I live?
no, no, I will vntwiste
My vital knotte, and this the knife,
which wrought my brothers death,
Shall likewise pierce my cruel heart,
and stop my vital breath.
And therewithal in desprate mood
he set the hilts on ground,
And thought with point of piercing knife
to take his latest wound:
But present knights withdrew his hand
from that untimely act,
And sought how to persuade him now,
(since finished is the fact)
The he depart from native soil
into some foreign place,
Whereas, deuoyde of further fear
and danger, he may pass
His life in safety, both from foe
and peril of the law:
To which Pesistratus agreed,
when he the danger saw,
That would ensue upon his case
if he were bent to stay,
And therefore speedily prepares
and takes his ready way
To secret place, where he might hide
his woeful head a space,
Til season that he may convey
his steps to further place.
But there arrived, woeful man,
his troubles so increase,
And he so vexed is in griefs,
which no wise he can cease,
That al addressed to mourneful chere,
his cares he does discus,
The which provoked his forced pen,
in verse to utter thus:
OH heavy heart dismayed, To the tun^ of Damon and pythias

oh stomach stuffed with pain,
Oh woeful wight, oh cursed wretch,
why should thou not complain?
Art thou in pleasant state,
or have thou cause to joy?
No, no, thy fates are frounst in fears,
come death and rid my ceasles anoy,
Oh cruel careless wretch,
do thou deserve thy life,
Since thou thy gentle brothers breast
have pearst with cursed knife?
What meanest thou to live?
and will thou life enjoy?
No no, thy fates are frounst in fears,
come death and rid my ceasles ano^
You fatal sisters all,
you twisters tear my threede,
With fatal knife my fatal knott
to share in have proceed.
For I unhappy wretch
am clean exilde from joy,
And live in woes, in griefs and fears,
come death and rid my ceasles anoy
ANd then the wretched heavy wight,
does spend the tedious time
In plaintes and tears, and vexing griefs,
bewayling former crime,
In such a mourneful sort, as who
had seen the man in fears,
To scald his pleasant youthful chekes
with such excess of tears,
His heavy heart would yearning, melt
to hear his woeful mones,
Whose griefs might move the fixed stars
or mollify the stones.
And yet (incessant) does he frounse
his heart in these his woes,
Regarding naught but wished grave
his carcass to enclose:
Whom, so dismayde in drousie dumpe
amidst his cares I leave,
And now to Kenedoxus state
my quil I must bequeaue.
OH heavy case, ambition should
because of such anoy,
That mutual bloudes should be dispersed
and so deuoyde of joy:
Oh hapless chance, unhappy thrice,
how fell is greedy rage,
That it should pester so the parts,
which reason can not swage?
Alas alas, ambition was it
that kindled all this fire?
And was it ambition which addressed
the brothers so to ire?
And was it ambition from the whence
this grievous case so grew?
Ambition was it, wherefore hark
what did thereof ensue.
Pesistratus for fear thus fled,
within a certain space
When dumpes avoided, vital course
returnde to proper place,
Then Kenedoxus did revive,
and musing very much
To see so great convent of knights,
full fraught with former grutch,
His body raised from the ground
in have with desperate blade:
As one distraught of reasons sense
he fiercely did invade
The knightly troop there present, who
dismaide to see the same,
Yet wisely pondring that to strike
it would be to their shame,
Entreated often him to cease,
pronouncing vows, that they
Were all his friends, and minded least
to seek for his decay.
Which waying, he perceiving eke
the man not present there,
On whom he sought revenge, and what
more cause he had to fear,
Soon stayde his hands, and gently then
he began for to request,
What cause compeld their presence there,
to be in armor dressed.
Who aunswerd, certifying him
of all the former case:
And how his brother they had sent
into a foreign place,
Because they feared he was dead,
supposing it for best
He should depart, than there to live
in danger and unrest:
But oh the dolor that redoundes
to Kenedoxus heart,
Impleating every vain with grief
or rather deadly smart,
When first he understood the same,
yet quickly was it laid,
For gain and ranckour did persuade
so much, that soon he stayed
Therefrom, because his greedy heart
had now the thing attaind,
I mean the lands for which so much
of travail he sustaind:
Ye^ further thinking of the thing
when he perused well,
And saw that Pesistratus had
the conquest as it fell,
Because that he was left as dead:
oh how did ranckour rage
In broyling breast, as poysned fire
which floodes may not assuage:
So fiercely freting did the fume
of choler frame his ire,
That if by suffraunce he might had
the full of his desire,
He would for anger have destroyed
himself in desperate mind,
Such was the scorneful pride whereto
his stomach was inclinde.
And twixt these passions, dolor so
attempting him, quoth he,
And is he fled, and does he think
to ^kape and to be free
By flight? no, no, though he suppose
I am a senseless corse,
Ere it be long he shall abide
and thoroughly feel my forse.
And therwithall a spightfull vow
in solemn wise he made,
That time should nere content his heart
till he with deadly blade
Had pierced Pesistratus sides,
whose then effused blood
Should only tend for to suffice
his ire and do him good.
Oh friendless frettes of hautie wrath,
O impe of serpents kind,
How could thy stomach so desire,
thy brothers life to blind?
What rest less rage assaulteth thee,
what strange disguised sort
Of devilish Gods, constrain thy will
such lewdness to support?
Thy brother does complain, to think
of thine unhappy fate
And his unkindness, thinking him
in more unhappy state.
And with excess of piteous tears,
and blubberings, sighs, and cries:
The loathsome tedious time he wears,
in a most mornefull wise.
And not so much for his exile,
as doubt of thy misfare,
Yet thou accursed, only sekst
and do employ thy care
To bring thy brother to his end,
regarding nature naught,
Nor yet the concord which by right
of brother should be sought.
Oh woeful hearing, what a thing
is this, that such a knight
As Pesistratus, fraught with grace,
with virtues, and with might,
Who long may live in quiet rest:
to do his country good:
Should so by ranckrous spite be forced,
to flee from native brood?
The cause of moan is very much.
and it disturbes me still:
Yet now compeld to leave my tears,
I must ordain my quill
To further thy deserved fame,
Pesistratus thou kind,
Whose praise I wish, were printed plain
in every bodies mind.
The hautie pride of ranckrous rage,
turmoyling thus in breast
Of Kenedox, when spiteful words
by tract of time were ceast,
Associated with the route,
of foresaid hunters train,
He is arrived at ^aliance wh^re
he wonted to remain:
And he no sooner seysed had
his footesteps in the town:
But it was rifely blown abroad,
and spread for true renown
That Kenedoxus was approcht,
and almost dead through wounds,
The which as by report to al,
so likewise it resoundes
Unto the hearing of his freindes
and kinsmen, who aghast,
With speedy travel did provide
to visit him in have:
And present viewing how the wight
was dyed in his blood,
Wherein he wallowed as a beast:
because they understood
Nothing of former case, as how,
Pesistratus had sped
His brother so: nor how for fear
of danger he was fled:
With musing much they did demand,
of his unlucky fare:
To whom the circumstance of all
did Kenedox declare,
Which vttred in dispightful sort
and in a raging wise*
With blasted face and stamping feet:
his kinsmen did surmise,
And wisely pondred of the case:
which well pervsing, they
Perceivde that Kenedox was cause
of this unhappy fray,
Whereon they chiefly did repute
to Kenedox the blame,
Who fiercely fuming more in frets
did rage to hear the same:
And they aggreued for to think
of Pesistratus exile,
Were even as fiercely bent again
to rough and raging style,
Whereon each party was displeasde:
for Kenedox was mad,
To see his brothers ^ase bewaylde
when he the wors^^ had:
And they lamenting, r^ed the time
that they had lost the wight,
I mean Pesistratus, whose help
was all their chiefest might:
And thereupon such taunting checkes
and words from every side
Proceeded forth, that grieved they
no longer would abide
With Kenedox, but cursed his pride,
and iudgde him for their foe:
As likewise he no otherwise
of them esteemde but so.
And thus departed they, whom now
as cause addressed to ire:
So cause to Pesistrate does move,
my pen for to retire,
The only reaper of the praise,
and gainer of the fame:
Which this my simple rude discourse,
endeavors to proclaim.
Who thus by fortune forced to hide,
his head in little space:
Provided well for to convey,
himself to further place.
For as it fell, a vessel riggde,
and ready dressed to ride,
Toward Italian coasts, was there
the very self same tide
That he arrived at the place,
whereto before he fled:
Whereof the woeful man was glad,
that he so well had sped.
And therefore briefly did conclude
with ^ailer for his hire:
The which agreed with prosperous wind,
and tide to their desire.
They set aloof, and hoysed sails,
and daunst amidst the seas,
With easy, calm, and pleasant streams
at their desired ease.
But Pesistratus he alas,
for all these foresaid things:
Could not unwrap him self from cares,
or such pernicious stings
As troubled him through former fact,
but ceaseless did lament
His curssed crime, which with excess
of tears he did repent.
Yet at the last when fancies fill,
he tumbled had in brain:
He somewhat left for to distill
his tears, and to complain,
And gathered stomach, as behoues
a man in such a case:
For to retain, though with much pain,
as Pesistratus was.
And therefore he avoiding greefes,
and setting cares apart:
Considering what was requisite,
with courage fraught his heart,
And craved aid with crouching knees,
of mighty love his hand:
Desiring comfort might prevail
his dolor to withstand.
Which prayers made, as one renewd,
and now no more anoyde:
He felt his burdened heart more light
and clean of cares deuoyde.
And therefore thanking mighty love
for sudden such relief,
He clean forsakes his drousie dumpes
and does disdain his grief:
And with a cheereful brain prouides
his voyage to forecast,
Supposing of the things to come,
and not of matters past.
And seeks to recreate his sense,
and to refreshe his mind,
With spending time in pleasant sort
and sportes of comely kind.
Whereto Aurore and Tytan both
do seem for to agree
With pleasant golden glittering raye^
which mutual splendant be.
As eke the silver surging streams,
which likewise seem to play
In pleasant sort with Titans beams
which beutifide the day.
And thus the season seeming fit,
in trait of time at last,
With help of Zephyrs gentle breath,
their journey ouerpast.
They arrivde in cons^nes of
Italian parts with ease,
Where as approcht, Pesistratus
does safely leave the seas,
And takes his way to certain place,
where he was bent to bide,
Till season that he might devise
a master to provide,
Whom he might serve, supposing so
to spend his tedious days:
Yet hoping well in tract of time
to find some other ways
To purchase credit, whereby he
might happier fate attain:
Wherein pervsing thus, he thought
to use therein his pain.
Alas what cause thou woeful wight
have thou to make thy moan?
How can thou brook? to serve a knight,
since thou thy self was one
Of worthy fame, and prowess more
in Gretia soil containd:
How may thy nusled custom be
by need so much restraind:
How can thou frame thy self to crou^
since crouching unto thee,
It was thy duty to receive
the crouch of cap and knee?
How can thou suffer for to leave,
the silken robes of thine:
And now thy tender corpse, to weeds
of baseness to refine?
How can thou gnaw of refuse bones,
when wont it was thy trade,
To feed of sweetest sauouring meats,
that ioyly iunckets made?
How can thou bear the taunting check*
of masters common use:
Or how can stomach be content,
to live in such abuse?
How may thou brook the fellowship,
of simple servile kind:
Or how may thou forbear so much,
for to subdue thy mind:
Since all the routes of courtly train,
were servile unto thee,
And ready pressed to execute
the will of thy decree?
How may thou frame to wear in s^e
of golden linked chain,
About thy neck, in bondage yoke,
of servitude and pain?
Yes yes, thou can, thy gentle heart
is void of ha^tie pride:
And thou as well can ease deny,
as it has thee denide.
And take thy fortune as it falls,
thou can forbear the same:
Wherefore I shall address my pen,
thy virtues to proclaim.
And this my verse though not as well,
as feign I do desire,
Because it wrought in Plutos forge
is tried with scarce good fire,
Yet shall endeavor to proceed,
to paint thy further praise
In full effect, who so will hear,
though not with hautie praise.
Pesistratus in former plight,
and place abiding still,
Expecting for a service such
as might content his will,
Considering of his doubtful state,
and case, perceived plain
That there to stay, it were a thing
but frustrate and in vain.
And therefore he departed thence,
where first he did ariue:
Well hoping of a fitter place,
where better he should thrive:
And as he trauelde, fortune so
by favor brought to pass,
That wandering witless up and down,
not knowing where he was:
There dwelt an ancient Hermit by,
in Sabels all y^lad,
With hoary bear, and countnaunce grave,
of gesture very sad,
Whom Pesistrate espying soon,
prepared for to meet:
And after met in courteous wise,
and manner did he greet:
And after greeted, did disclose,
the sum of all his care,
Requiring Sire to have remorse,
to his unlucky fare:
Desiring further that he would
vouchsafe to entertain
Him in his service, wherein he
did vow to use his pain.
To whom with gentle speech the Sire
did courteously reply,
That he was bent to live alone,
as likewise so to die:
But viewing both the seemly shape,
the countenance and the grace
Of Pesistrate, in tract of time
when he had paused a space:
My Son (quoth he) I pity much
the cause of thine anoy,
And would to god my power could streetch,
to work thy further joy:
But if my simple cottage may
suffice thee for to please,
And to remain with me my son,
thou think it for thine ease,
My heart contented is to grant,
therein thy whole request:
As likewise for to pleasure thee,
in ought else am I pressed.
For which Pesistratus did thank
a thousand times the Sire,
That he vouchafed so to grant
the thing he did require.
And thus a pun^^ Hermit he
become, they did repair
Unto their little cottage by,
avoiding open air.
Where as refection taken they
as erst return to walk
Again: and then the Sire begins,
in former wise to talk.
Demanding Pesistratus, why
he left his native soil:
Who blanke to sp^ake, yet fearing least
he purchase should a toil,
Deuisde a shift: and as he thought
to speak, in boisterous haste
A Lion fier^^ with stamping feet
who thereby had bin c^ast,
Came fl^^ging fiersly toward them,
with open roaring voice
And gaping mouth and staring eyes,
and fearful thundering noise.
Whom when they spide* the father feared,
beg^n to cry: Oh knight,
Thou have deceived me, whereon
the Saints do beer me spite*
But Pesistra^^^ ^el aduisde,
preparde his sword and shield.
The which in journey he had borne,
and brought into the field.
And with a courage met the beast,
in such a rigorous sort,
That plain by force, he set his tail
on ground, for all his port.
And further fiersly so attempt,
that with his testy blade
He spil^ in twain his heart, before
recovery could be made.
And whilst so manfully be dealt,
the chas^rs following fast,
Were present come, who viewing this,
were wondrously aghast.
This only one durst so assault,
the best which they before
Durst not inuiron or attempt,
without at least a skore.
And feared sire, when he so saw,
the valiantness of heart.
In Pesistrate, began to cry,
S. George is of our part.
And with a thousand yielded thanks
he gratified his pay^^,
Desiring pardon for (...) words,
when erst he* did complain.
And Pesistratus thus attaind,
the conquest of the beast:
Which after was the chiefest cause,
that set his heart at (...)
For in the route* of the convent
of chasers, was a knight
Of prowess great, and valor like,
who Pecipater ^ight:
He bare the most and chiefest sway
in countries therabout,
But chiefly in Tarentum town
a city void of doubt:
Because it florisht through the means
of Pecipater, who
Beholding Pesistrate his fight,
his strength and co^rag^ so,
Was moved with inward^ burning zeal
of favor to retain:
As though his love were ready pressed
to quite Pesistrates pain.
And therefore, when the victory
by Pesistrate attainde,
Each turmoyle cast the raging beast,
by force was so restrainde.
With comely grace in coursers corpse,
he Pesistrate does (...).
Whom with abundant courtesy,
the gentle knight did greet,
And after salutations made
to him and to the slay,
He does of Pesistratus straight.
with frendlynesse require,
By what adventure he was driven
to meet the chased beast?
Who did inform him of each thing,
and answer his request,
With no less gravity than words.
in seemly order set,
And gesture courtly, comely grace
and comeliness as great,
Which Pecipater noting well
and liking, did devise
In semblant sort, to utter that
his fancy did surmise
To crave, which was in fellowship
Pesistrate to retain:
Whose peerless prowess be esteemde
each mortal wightes to s^aine.
In season therefore fit assignde,
he moves with pleasant style,
His frenldy words, and thus said he,
it were a great exile.
My friend Pesistratus that we
by happy fortune met,
Should part, whose presence neither cause
nor season seems to let^
But not so much exile, as grief
and dolor unto me,
Who should esteem thy presence left,
my self not to be free.
But thral to care, such is the zeal
that stirs my desire
To crave thy presence, wherefore yield
to that I do require.
I can not choose said Pesistrate,
but very well suppose
Of all the profred friendship which
so friendly you disclose.
But yet the baseness of my birth,
and bareness of my state*
And rudeness of my person, seem
unfit for such a mate,
Which be the motions that compel
me boldly to deny
(My pardon cravde) for to assent
thus to presume so hie,
As match the mate, whose bondage may
beseem my servile kind
More better far, than for to yield,
to your desirous mind.
Yet Pecipater could not be
suff^led with the same,
Nor judged the abasing of
himself to be defame:
But was importunate the more
to have him to agree:
Whereto Pesistratus with thanks
did yield, when he did see
The gentle valor that was shrinde
in Pecipaters breast,
And ioyde in tart to think his state
was settled at such rest:
That where as erst an exilde wight,
he wandered up and down,
He now a rulers mate has reapt
by fortune such renown,
And (...) agreed, they do repair
wi^h sire to cottage by,
Where as a while they did provide,
their weary lymmes to lie
At more of ease, and then refresht,
with taken leave of Sire,
Unto Tarentum whence they came
they buskled to retire.
With whom Pesistrate worthy knight
departing: took his leave
Of foresaid Sire, whose wish the like
to god did him bequeaue.
And now eck praunser ready pressed,
with ten thing furnished fit:
As tracking trappers, saddels trim,
and large restrayning bit:
The lusty valiant youthful knights,
proceed with stamping pace
And portly gesture, toward that
the said desired place,
And moving talk of hunters trade,
they reason of their game,
Whereby Pesistratus was known
as expert in the same,
As present any* whereon each
did judge and deem his race,
More rather rightly to proceed
of royal blood than base.
Whose comely countenance pleased so
each wight, that each man thought
Himself a happy mate, that fate
had such companion brought.
But Pecipater happiest he,
esteemde amongst the rest
Himself, that what he chiefest sought*
such fortune had addressed:
And thus each party well content,
such friendlynesse does flow
From every side, that Pesistrate
lets foresaid sorrows go:
And only now deuiseth he
their curtsies to requi^e:
And thus whilst tract of time by stealth,
had taken proof of flight,
And they approached had their pace,
unto Tarentum nie,
Pecipater a varlet sendes
before, for to discry
The conquestis won, and that his will
was each man should prepare
Against his presence seemly shows,
their conquest^s to declare.
Which message done by varlet, was
provided in the town:
For triumph each thing ready fit
pretending great renown:
As valiant route of armed knights,
with glistering helmes and shieldes:
And blazing banners set aloft,
in turrets, fortes, and fields,
And trumpets sounding up triumph,
and drums pretending fame:
And iangling belles with Musikes art,
well placed in the same.
And diverse well devised toys,
and sundry pleasant sightes,
Attendant ready for the fame
of these t^iumphant knights.
And all the chief and nobles there,
assembled ewre likewise
In decent order for the nonce,
each thing was so precise,
Amidst the which, the royal race
of Pecipaters blood,
The hiest room and worthiest place
possessing: seemly stood,
Their worthy kinsman to salute
with such advised praise,
As does behoue for worthy wight
which has deserved praise.
Which was so passing pleasant sight,
as could be wished no more:
For both of lusty youthful knights.
and glittering dames such store,
Were present, as in Tarent town,
the like was never seen:
Nor yet in all Italian costs,
no better could have bin.
Yet most surpassing all the rest,
in beauties beams as far,
As glittering glee of P^ebes form,
surmountes the twinkling star.
Was present one, a certain dame,
who Catanea hight,
The sister to Pecipater,
a peerless gemi^e by right:
For seemly such she was, as though
she framed were in molde:
With equal grace so equal matched,
as tongue may not unfold.
Here beauty, blazing m^re in sight,
within her angelike face,
Than in the skies, the golden rays
of Tytans ^aumping race.
Such perfect ^eature firmly fixed
within her secret frame:
As though by right, dame Nature scornde,
she chalendge endless fame,
With courteous countenance, comely corpse,
and portrature demure,
So rare that Gods might seem to bow
her fancy to procure.
And so indude in every point,
wi^h natures special gifts,
As though she only perfect wrought,
each else by feigned shifts.
This Nimphe with all the foresaid route,
now ready do remain^:
Expecting for the presence of
her brother and his train.
And viewing thus at last, she spits
the knights approached nie:
Whereon each thing provided proves
his prowes for to (...):
For trumpets sound, and shalmes record,
and cornets quiver fast,
To gratify the conquerors
with sweet saluting blast.
And every thing rejoicing, seems
to make a pleasant tide.
Wherein the seemly knights be come.
I and they arrived ride
^n decent order, prauncing fast,
on corpse of comely steed:
Which satisfide each eyesight well,
his fancy for to feed:
For first the youthful valiant knights,
conducting praunst before,
In seemly rank and portly grace
as does behoue the^fore.
And then Pecipater in midst,
with Pesistrate proceeds,
By certain sign pretended well
the proof of each man's debes:
For Pecipater had a head
of wild and tusked Bore,
Which he himself by force had slain,
transported him before:
And Pesistrate of Lion fierce,
the great and grisly ^ed
Which he had slain, as erst was said,
before his courser led.
And thus in Tarent streets arivde,
the people al rejoice,
To see such valiant sight, whereon
was moude so great a noise,
As though with thanks they would have raised
the Conquerours to skies,
So glad the people for their praise,
did move such lofty cries.
But every wight that marked well,
Pesistratus his grace,
His feautred limbs so sightly set,
and pight in equal place,
As though the Gods had all agreed
to frame of earthly molde,
In human form a wondrous work,
for nature to behold:
Not little musing, praised much
his valor in their mind:
Whose peer in every point they judge,
a man should never find.
And still proceeding forward thus,
at last they came to place,
Whereas remainde the royal troop,
of Pecipaters ra^e.
To whom they used reverence such,
as like was used again.
With modest coun^nance, to the route
of Pecipaters train.
But when Pecipater himself,
with Pesistratus was
Thereto appr^cht, who then had seen
the courtesy did p^s^e
From part to part, he would have thought
Minerua had indude:
Their seldom seen (...) there,
with none such gestures (...).
So courtly countnaunce did unfold
the meanin^s of the mind:
Pretending outwardly wher^^
the senses were inclinde.
And after salutations thus
concluded, to the praise
Of Pesistrate* Pecipater
to Catanea says:
If one surpassing other each*
a peerless may be hight:
This youth possessed with ^arest gifts,
de^erues the name by right:
Indude with courag^, fraught with truth
abounding full of fame.
And natures g^ft is so seldom seen
as few retain the same.
Whereon his person greeting well,
to Pesistrate she faide:
His presence welcome, thrice and thrice,
but silly he dismaide
To view the (...) beuties blaze
appearing in her face,
And eke her (...) protrature,
and correspondent grace:
As one of wits b^stroug^t did stand,
infected at the heart.
With (...) and poisned point
of Cupides (...)
And had no (...) to move his speech,
his tongue was so restraind:
Nor render t^^nkes* his nummed sense
was so in secret painde.
Yet pa^sing time ^^^ening strength,
such h^^t^ thanke^ quoth he,
I yield and wish, as by my tongue
they may not vtterd be.
Which well she we^ed, marking eke,
how course of blood did change,
As likewise wistly viewd his veins,
in panting wise to raunge:
Yet all the rest suspected least
thereof, but only waide
The comely answer which to hi^,
i^ seemly wise he said.
For which in mind each did commend
him much, pretending so
In courteous wise as he could deem,
in presence none a foe:
And then in one convent they went
to Pecipaters place,
There for to use such meet repastes,
as fitted for the case.
And Catanea she alone
with Pesistrate did walk,
Who by occasion movde, did use
such sober friendly talk,
As either party liked well,
whereon their stomachs flame
In mut^all love, and Cupides fire,
proceeding in the same,
In zealous wise, though that unknown
it was to either, how
The others heart to eithers will,
was ready for to bow.
And thus each trapped in the (...),
of sudden seemly sight,
Their fancies feeding on the baits,
of further loves delight.
When voyage finished, they are com^
to Pecipaters place,
Each gift will greeted as behours,
such curtsie for the case,
And Pesistrate like welcomed: they
persevere further still,
With filed tongue, and pleasant style,
to please each others will.
Till such time as season did
their appetites require,
With natures (...) to frede
their natural desire.
The which approcht, provided well,
such delicates they have,
Of every commendable kind,
as heart no more might ^raue.
It were a folly therefore that
I further should pretend:
For to describe their sumptuous f^ast,
and to afrustrate ^nde.
Because in (...) words may it serve,
the whole for to di^close:
It was as delica^e and (...),
as fancy might suppose.
This matter (...), I will
proceed for to proclaim
This Pesistratus worthy praise,
and Cataneas fame.
Of whom my purpose took in hand,
with pen for to endite
Their sudden love, and constant faith
to set in open sight.
When feast was finished, and the day
intending to his end:
Sir Titan leaves his splendant streams,
a while for to extend.
The guestes with rendering hearty thanks,
be ready to repair,
Each to his vain, as cause did move
their presence to be there.
And Catanea with them bent,
in likewise to depart:
Her brother left (who wished her yet
to stay with willing heart*)
Did mind to we^^ to dwelling place,
where wonted she remainde,
Of uncle ^yrs, who from her youth,
in virtues had her traynd
To present age, yet not forgot,
she takes desired leave,
Whom Pecipater to the Gods
tuition did bequeaue.
And then to Pesistrate she frames
her speech in gentle wise:
Well wishing to his person health,
and so the homeward vies.
But who had seen the countenance of
Pe^i^tratus when he,
Perceiud he must forg^ the sight,
which most ^e cravde to set.
He would have thought the silly man,
were ready pressed to dye:
His heavy doleful gestures so
his sorrows did discrie.
Which she perceiving, could not choose
but blush and was abasht.
Whereby her ^uddie rising blood,
in countnance fully flasht
At first: but afterward her heart
for sorrow waxing cold,
No blood at all her (...) fa^e,
by any means ^ould hold.
And thus the lou^^s at the (...)
departing, heavy cheer,
Did force (...) of (...) inward thought
at large for to appear:
Though certainly it was not known
to each ^f others loves.
Byca^se experience had not tried,
in season it to prove:
But joy m^ happy ^a^e to think,
of courtesy I find
Of you, and long to see the day,
whereby may be resignde
Some part of recompense for this,
your friendly friendship found:
Which well I may suppose in none
more amply to abound.
And when the place avoided thus,
of gues^es no more remainde,
But Pesistrate, whose heavy heart,
was so by grief restrainde,
From comfort clean, Pecipater,
espying him alone,
Demands why he was so sad,
and seemed for to moan:
The whom said Pesistrate, my Lord
I have no cause to wail:
Nor yet occasion that with grief
my stomach should assail.
The recompense already done,
(quod Pecipater) is:
And therefore friend Pesistratus,
surmise no more of this.
But think: as Saints do witness bear,
that for to do thee good,
I minded am in thy behalf,
to spend my proper blood:
If therefore that thou should misdoubt
hereof, what might be said:
But that I should with tears lament
the same, and so he slayd
To speak: and Pesistrate he led
from thence to chamber by,
Which was provided for the nonce,
his weary limbs to lie.
Where Pecipater further did,
his ^^iendlinesse protest.
Desiring him there for his ease
to use his quiet rest.
For which Pesistratus did thank,
both with his mouth and mind,
His gentleness a thousand times,
and then to couche declinde.
And Pecipater did depart:
but when a little space
Pesistratus had line on bed,
reuoluing of his case,
He was so vexed silly man,
that nothing could appease
Or once assuage his sorrows, but
increasing his disease,
He thinks of Catanea, who
has so in fetters yokt
His loving heart, that all his joys
to thraldom are prouokt.
And he suppressed to bondage like,
and so the miser lies
Bewayling such his wretched fates,
with sundry plaintiff cries.
And when he thinks, how much unlike
he is to get relief:
The more in doubt and deep despair
increases still his grief:
And thus dismayed, in diverse dumps
he lies, and woeful wight
Dyspaires, and yet he hopes, but fears
least time should work despite.
And wrapped in the dulled drouse,
which fortune has assignde
Unto his pay, a thousand thoughts
surmising in his mind:
His turmoylde wits enforced so,
his sorrows to discuss,
Did urge his faultring tongue at last
with pain to utter thus:
Ah wretch, what friendlesse fates be thine,
thou curssed catife thris^*
How feltst thou fortunes froward force?
how do thy cares arise?
How can thou suffer such anoy?
how may thou more forbear
Such griping grief, with pinching pangs
so vehemently to tear
Thy heart in sunder? yield thy knife
from thy unhappy hand,
To rid thee from such vexed life,
thy dolors to withstand,
For banished from native soil,
thou liv'st an exile here,
And yet art bridled with the yoke
of pensi^enesse and fear,
Tormented with the sudden sights,
and trapped in the snare,
Of one who skornes thy loyal love,
and least regardes thy care.
Alas what therefore should thou do,
but to thy death consent:
Since fortune does, and season least
to thy relief relent?
Woe worth the curssed time when breath.
was yielded unto thee
In mothers womb, would poison had
more rather bin thy fee.
Woe worth the tide, when to the world,
of mother thou wast borne:
Would then thy childish tender limbs,
had bin to tatters torn.
Woe worth the food that ever since,
thy nature has sustainde.
Woe worth the nursse that from mishap,
thy youthful age restraind.
Woe worth the craking cradle which
was rocked for thine raze:
Would each disport had bin addict
thy humor to displease.
Woe worth that ere thou wast aduaunst
in native propre soil:
Would God thy brothers hands had given
to thee thy l^^est foil.
Woe worth the curssed fist which wrought
thy brothers fatal pain.
Which was the cause that brought thee here.
and moves thee to complain.
Woe worth the vessel which conveyed,
thy corpse to present place:
Neptunus crase his seemly sides,
and all his ^al^es deface.
What should I curse and further say,
to rid me of my smart:
But death dispatch my lothed life,
and fury brast my heart.
But brainlesse fool why curse I thus
my self, and cry out so:
More seemly were it that I blist
my self, and cursed my so,
Who is the cause of all this grief,
and worker of my pain:
Why should I not with taunting tongue,
her wily battes disdain,
Which has my senses so deceiude,
and yielded such anoy,
Unto my pay, that in despair
I live deuoyde of joy.
Oh Pesistrate, art thou to learn*
of women's wonted wills?
Art thou to know, that sooner none
the sheep, than Fox begiles?
Art thou unskillful of the trade*
of woman's wanton lure?
Have thou not hard what fond conceits,
their practisde slights procure?
Yes, yes* renew to memory
their ticklenesse of will:
Their poysned looks, their fained grace,
their counterfaited skill,
I trow thou needst not to be taught,
their practice is so plain:
That women all by kind are bent,
and nature, for to faint.
For if she view the personage, which
does please her in her mind:
Then seeks she to display her snares,
as in familiar kind.
And if consenting he pretend,
to use her in likewise,
Then seems she coy, and stranger straight
and is as much precise.
If humble he, then hauty she,
and seems to scorn his suit:
But if he coy, then hates she,
and frowning stands mute.
And if intrapped, he bewail
to her his careful ^ate,
She seems to muse, what love should mean
and laughes at his estate.
But if she love, and he despise
to put the like in ure:
Then labors she by subtle slights,
his fancy to procure.
Which got, she seems for to reject,
regarding naught at all:
But joys and judges it a sport,
to purchase him a fall,
Shame therefore so to set thy mind,
on such despised toys,
Which hinder wealth, and move defame,
and breed thee such anoyes.
And settle wits to such advise,
as may provide thee rest:
From lovely fits, for reason seems
such fondness to detest.
Suppose the Lady whom thou love
were meant for to requite
Thy loyal love with love again,
were this thy chief delight?
Forgettest thou the unfaithfulness
of Helen, who forsook
Her spoused Menelaus, and
to Paris her betoke?
Or falsed faith of Cresseda,
whom Troylus served long
Remember how these fickle dames,
did work their lovers wrong:
And let the griefs of Troy^us,
and Cresseds ^auering mind,
Be warning to thy loving fits,
least like requite thou find.
And seek in time to bridle will,
least after some repast
Of pleasure had, thy griefs renew
a thousand times as fast.
What say I, should I leave my love
and Catane forsake?
Or should my fancy craft so soon,
or service thus aslake?
And should I now despise the dame,
whom ea^st my zealous heart
So loved, that for her sake it could
sustain eternal smarte?
No, no, the fi^^ shall loose his might
the sun his golden glee,
And heavens their hew, before such thought
surmised be of me:
For courteous nature, gentle grace,
and seemelynesse abounds,
So rifely, as to every ear
it famously resoundes:
With feature such as Venus she,
her self may not compare,
Or once presume in equal sort
her virtues to declare.
Nor Dian for her chastity,
to match her virgins race,
Nor once Minerua vouchsafe will
to set her self in place,
Not only this, but eke of hye
and famous stock she springs,
Whereto as reputation like,
dame Fame daily forth brings:
Since therefore thus she wants naught.
that fancy may require,
How mad man I from such a dame,
to bridle my desire:
And bow to blame for to reproach
the comely courteous kind
Of women, since such heavenly gifts
they do possess in mind.
But oh alas, accursed wight,
why think I of her hue:
What does it bote her worthy state
or birth for to renew?
What does the lodged virtues in
her tender gentle breast
Provoke my joy, or noble birth,
intend to work my rest?
No whit at all, but those things most
compel me to misfare,
And depely drown me in misdoubt,
and dubble all my care.
For since she wants naught at al,
the which I seem to crave.
But does possess each needful gift,
that more she may not have:
The more infe^iour do I seem
to her, whose royal grace
My simple birth in scorning sort
may utterly deface.
And do despair when each respect,
I ponder in my mind:
As thinking of her hauty state:
how basel^ mine inclynde.
For where she come of noble line,
does live with honored name,
I silly wret^^ in exile state,
do purchase naught but shame:
And she determind, at her case
does live in wished joy?
I poorly spend the troublous time,
misdoubting more anoy.
Alas, alas, why think I then
of this, since plain I see,
Her birth, her state and virtues rare
so unfit for my degree?
Or why presume I so to match
my self with royal race,
Why? well I may presume, because
I live in hope of grace.
In hope of grace? why blinded fool,
does grace grow from disdain?
No skorne of hope: yes skorne of force
in hautie hearts remain:
In hauty hearts I do agree,
but in a gentle breast
Does favor flow, and hautie skorne
is utterly suppressed.
But is thy Lady lowly such?
yea certesse: can lofty state
Agree to match with simple slave
and make decay his mate?
Yea Cupid forces Keysars bend,
and lays Princes pride:
Yet know y^ not thy Ladies mind,
b^caus^ thou have not tryde.
Then try I will: how dare thou try?
my hope prouokes me so,
What cause of hope have thou? beware
thy hope is most thy foe.
Her outward shape is cause enough,
my hope for to maintain:
Through sightly bait the silly fish
receives his latest d^ine:
Alas then death to thee I yield:
thus sa^de the woeful wretch,
And therwithall his lothed limbs
he began abroad to stretch:
And through his grief the sincking smarte
that sucked through his vain^s
Distild the water to his heart
which so increast his pains,
That silly senses overcome
he faints to the ground:
And dampish humor loathsome life
enclosed in a swound
In time when vital course redound
according to his kind:
His sprites reuivde, but yet his griefs
were printed in his mind.
And raising then himself again
upon his toused bed,
He lays his weary limbs to muse,
and rest his heavy bed.
But rest disdaynes his furious frets,
and hope does scorn his health:
And naught does happen to his hope
that might renew his wealth.
And thus in painful plight the time
maintains his lingering life:
He wishing only vital twist,
were cut by fatal knife,
And having no disport ne cause
of comfort in his care:
The more he strives, the more he is
entangled in the snare.
And therefore patiently perforce
he takes his chanced fate:
And wallowes in his woes as does
behoue a lovers slate:
And then he thinks of Catane,
supposing of her grace:
Whose comely countnaunce minding well,
his fancy se^^ her face,
And ponders of her fr^endly looks,
as (...) her seemly cheer:
And does imagine of her shape,
as though she had been there,
In present sight he printed so
^ir feature in his t^ought,
As if Apelles through his Art,
her picture had ywrought.
Then dreams his humor, that he makes,
to Cresside his complaint,
And shows his cause and case, as how
her beauty did attaint
His simple ^enses at the first,
which straight subdued were*
Unto her yoke, as servile slaves
to harm, to hope, and fear.
And now the passing pangs, that he
sustained for her sake,
He tells, and how his diverse doubts*
do cause his heart to quake.
And then he sues and craves for grace,
to purchase at bit hand
His full request, for to be losd
from bondage and her band.
And then he thinks his Lady seems
some favor for to show,
But out of this amaze his wits
reuiude, when he does know
That only fancy fed his fear,
and no such thing to be
Is he ymaginde in his heart,
or thought his eye should see.
The griesly griping gulfes and rage,
that broyled in his breast:
And qualming coldes did so agreeue,
and work him such vnreast,
The s^^ly wretch his vital course
distempered, he d^^lynd,
As one, who to the heavens again
his spirits had refinde.
And still, as often as he reui^d,
he faynted down again.
And thus the thrice unhappy man
was turmoyld in his pain,
Whilst lucky fortune drove, by chance,
Pecipater to please,
Where Pesistratus was diseasde
and vered in such case.
Whom vi^wing ^e with shriking cries
did move so hye a voice,
That Pesistrate from former trance,
renyued through the noise.
To whom Pecipater did strain
his woeful speech, and said:
Alas, Pesistrarus my friend,
what ceasles cares vpbrayde
Thy youthful race, that vexed thus,
thou s^endst thy wo^full d^yes,
In ceaseless plai^tes, in moves and tears,
and seeks no other ways
For to avoid the cause of griefts?
whence comes this thy care?
What thing does cause? what wight has wrought
thy dull vn^usty fare?
And so he stint, and skal^ing tears
distilling on his breast,
Pesistrate said* let not my greefes
be cause of thine unrest
My Lords for ten times cursed I,
have forsing cause to wail,
Yet not for present cause which should
my woeful heart assail:
But thinking on such matters past
as in my country do^e,
My vanquished stomach much displeasde
was so by dolor won,
The which insorst me to complain:
naught else my Lord surmise,
But let this serve (quoth Pesistrate)
your fansy to suffice.
By this excuse was ^e dissolvde,
that naught should move his grief,
But ma^ters past, and therefore seeks
to yield him some relief,
As might intend for to expel
Pesistrats thoughtfull care.
The which allurde his heavy heart
to somewhat better fare.
Yet though a little were decreast
the torments of his pain,
The countenance of Catane,
was buried in his brain:
And thus he frounst amidst his thought
and feeding fancies fyl.
I leave a while, and shall resign
to Catane my quyll.
Whose drowsy dumps, whose dainty douts,
whose fickle fits, whose fears,
Whose grisly goulfes and piteous playntes,
whose sobbes, whose sighs and ^eares,
To paynt at large, you Furies teach,
you Nymphs dispose my style,
Apollo guide, Minerua mind
my mazed m^se a while,
Departed from her brothers place,
arrived when she was
Where she remaynde, in secret wise
to closet did she pas,
Where all alone, surmising of
the matters past of late,
She began to muse, bow Pesistrate
by sudden happy fate,
Should meet her brother as he did:
and musing thus in thought,
By Cupides force, in fancies fire,
attend what thing was wrought.
Forsaking to respect the chance,
perusing in her mind
Pesistrats comeliness, she thought
in what a courteous kind
He did salute her, when at first
she viewd his friendly face.
And how in sudden sort, his blood
did course from place to place.
And thus respecting of his change,
her fancy did consent,
That if he lovde, the like of her
for ever should be meant.
For why? pervsing each respect
that nature had bestowde,
She said in mind, in Pesistrate
that al these virtues flowde.
And thinking of his portlynesse,
she could not but suppose
His comely gesture to excel:
and thus her thoughts arose
So long as til at last insnarde,
like little fish on ho^ke,
Who long has played with pleasant bayte
and in the end is took,
She is res^raind, her fre^dome lost,
and had no power to starte,
But firmly vowed, and fixed has
to Pesistrate her heart.
And thus consented to this new
and fiery zealous love,
From whence no power she could attain
did fansi^ to remove,
She (...) ^ir dis^ased corpse
on co^ch, ^o ease her mind?
To whom Mercurius, Sopor has
in sodayn e^orte refinde:
And (...) with the drousie rod,
the winged fellow shows
To her in dream Pesistratus,
whose countenance well she knows,
Of whom she thought she did receive
a ring of purest gold,
With bloody letters therein gravde,
the which when she did hold,
Did seem to blede excessiuely,
and al her fist defilde,
Wherein, Mercurius fled away
and Sopor clean exylde,
She waking straynd her slender throat
in such a piteous wise,
As well I deem her sighs and sobbes
did pierse the highest skies:
Yet seeing that it was but dream,
contented somewhat more
She stayed a while, but knowing well
the fearfulness before,
Her passions then begin a new,
and ceasles she complaynes,
With heavy mones and trikling tears
increasing double pains,
And began of each especial point
to ponder and surmise,
As of the ring, and of the blood,
but naught she could devise
That might maintain the token good
of blood that did distill,
Whereon not able for to rule
her self, nor guide her will,
Through vexing grief her careful thought
suppressing senses force,
She lies in trance as though distraught
of ly^e, like senseless corse:
And when as vital course returned,
in former plight she* spendes
The time renewd, and ceasseth not,
but earnestly she sendes
Her sobbes and sighs from laden heart:
yet after season past,
When tract of time delayed had
the fierceness of the blast,
Whereby the stomach more at ease
was somewhat more at rest:
She pondring further of the thing,
began much to detest
The former rashness of her love,
accompting it a shame,
That erste her tickle will was bent
to such deserved blame:
Whereon for grief that such abuse
had blinded wandering wits,
Her tongue was movde amidst the rest
of these her diverse fittes,
To paint despite, in such a sort
with scorneful taunts conuayde,
As might suffice for fancies ease,
and thus the Lady said:
If reason ought for to persuade
the foolishness of will,
Or wise forcast to teach the trade
that does engender ill,
Or counsel lead the weakling wits,
whom knowledge does not guide,
Or else experience show the proof
of matters to be tried,
How much unwise accursed I,
whom neither reason led,
Nor yet forcast could make avoid
the dangers may be bred,
Nor counsel move for to beware,
nor by experience past
Advise my self, but have agreed
in such a sudden have
To fix my foolish fancy fast
on such a doubtful wight.
Who for his fault in native soil,
has hither made his flight,
Or else, for want of succor there,
is glad to use his pain.
In forreyne parts, as toyling wretch
to get his hired gain?
Or witless wench, and could thou thus
consent to exile slave,
And purchase pain unto thy pay,
bewitched do thou rave?
Suppose the infamy, the shame,
the poverty, the care,
The fall, the loss of foriner fame,
the rainous misfare
That were addicted to thy case
if matched to such a ma^e,
Thou were content to yield thy self
to his abased state:
And think how might thy kindred scorn
thy will, and yield thee blame,
As also how thou should deserve
and reap reports defame.
Might it not rightly be replyde,
thy fondness was thy fall?
And would not thy abuse be scornde
and mocked, yes certes of all.
Why t^en, disdain such foolishness,
and set thy self at rest,
A ^oyde such shame, forecast thy cares
and case, for this is bent:
And let such cause of thine anoy
be ^ur^hest from thy thought,
Least stomach won, thou should to late
repent the thing were wrought.
And then she pausde, and then again
in new reu^luing mind,
How much is scorneful tongue (quoth she)
to scornefulnesse inclind?
Thy blame I so the seemeliest Knight
that earthly globe contaynes?
Or why presume I to reproach
with tongue which naught restraynes,
But vomits al his ve^ime out,
Pesistratus, whose grace,
Whose comely corpse and seemly port
discries his loyal race.
Why name I him an exyle slave,
whom gesture does bewray
For to proceed from princely line,
and season does display
No slave, but for his manhood tryde
a worthy valiant Knight,
Is has appearde by prowess provde
of late in open sight?
And why a toyling wretch call I,
the noble youth with shame?
Whose honored acts I may perceive
to yield him hauty fame.
Unhappy tongue, restrain such talk,
think (heart) with happy joy,
If thou were lovde as thou do love,
would banish thy anoy:
And such disgracing lay apart,
suppose what seemly h^w
Pesistrate bears, his comely corpse
and grace does now renew:
Whose feature passes all the Gods,
and wit Appollo stains,
And whose especial planted gifts
abound in natures veins:
Thou know his gesture does excel,
his personage eke does pass
Each wights, since taken life thou viewdst,
or ere in Tarent was:
And further, needs thou must confess
his manhood to be rare:
And is not this sufficient then,
since al these virtues are
In him so plast* to move thy mind,
and stir in fancies fire
Such zeal, as then to yield thy self
to him and his desire?
Think how accorda^^t in this years
and fit in each degree,
Save present wealth in likely place,
the wight does seem to thee:
And well pervsing thou may know
that riches is the least,
And vainest thing by due to be
accounted for the best:
And whether would thou be content,
to spend thy lingering days.
With crooked wretch, whose only wealth
and riches were his stays,
Or live with seemly adorned wight.
whose youthful years possess
Sufficient sk^l to yield thee ^ase,
and purchase wealths increase?
Whereon she stayde a while, and then
in feeding fancy still,
Why do I thus restrictly note
with such a special will,
The worst of his estate? and why,
suppose I of his want,
Or think of ought he lacks, since
his virtues be not scant?
No, no respect rejected clean,
I shall adioyne my heart
And zealous love to Pesistrate,
for ever not to start:
And whether hatred do assail
our state, or fortune frown,
Or scorn endeavor to suppress
our fame, and pull it down,
Or want provoke us for to beg,
my heart shall still consent,
To feel what Pesistrate does feel,
and never shall repent:
And though that fortune be our for,
yet shall report display,
That faithful lovers livde in link
and did in one decay.
And therewithal as though in deed,
their loves had bin supplyde,
If ever (quoth she) Pesistrate,
it otherwise be fryde,
Than that I ever shall perform
my ^xed faith to thee,
The furies ^eare my tender flesh,
and poison be my fee.
But when the pausing time in tract
had set in plainer sight,
Her former fits, she pondring eke
the lack of her delight,
Because she was uncertain of
such certain love again
From ^esistrate, as she did yield,
oh how she did complain:
Accursing both dame natures art,
who had employde her eyes
To work throw sight such sudden griefs,
as eke with careful cries
So cursed the time, that ever breath
her carkas had iclad,
And season, whereby maintenance
of lingering life was had:
And then her griefs increased so,
and she was bound to pain,
That having not sufficient strength
her dolours to restrain,
Her feeble limbs were forft to faint,
and prostrate on the ground
The Lady lay, still dumps were sled
and vital course redound:
And then renewde, like passion does
her to^sed wits compel,
For to record her caus^ of cares,
which to her case befell:
Wherein the further pondring, did
peruse how folly lead
Her tickle will whereon her griefs
was ^rst the more ybread?
And thinking thus, as one prouokt,
not able to withholde
Such earnest motion, for her case
with tongue she did unfold
His altered mind and changed dumps,
which forced her thus to say:
None but my self unhappy wretch
is cause of my decay?
For it is my folly that assures
my griefs, because in vain
I hope, come therefore wished death,
and ryd n^e of my pain.
Alas if doubt should make beware
the doubtful, wherefore then
(O Catane) do thou no^ doubt,
whose doubt is despair clea^^?
Or why do thou ascertayne so
thy self to have in hold
Pesistrates heart, as he has thine,
what makes thee so bold?
Thou know yt youth does mind affairs
that tend to purchase fame,
And not such joys to think upon,
thou thrice and thrice to blame.
Why then should not thy self the like
endeavor set aside,
Such folly clean, as seems by right
thy rudeness to deryde?
And this so said, she did declyne
to drousie couch, where as
A thousand sobs and sighs arise,
and sundry thoughts do pass
From grieved carkas to the skies,
whom moning thus a while
I leave, and to Pesistratus
I shall resign my style.
That woeful wight, who likewise vexed,
(as erst was said) remaynes
In midst of his abundant griefs,
wherein he still complayns.
And thus, the lovers live in lack
of that they most desire,
And mutual both incessant burn
in Cupids paineful fire:
Whom for a space the season moves
my verse for to re^raine,
Til season such as season shall
enforce my pen again
To leave the state of Kenedox
and doings to discry,
Whereto now season craves I should
my present pen apply.
THat Kenedox was left as dead
by Pesistrate it is said,
And likewise how by hunting Knights
he homewarde was conuayde,
As also, how through this abuse
his kinsmen movde to ire,
Which came to visit him, in rage
did back again retire.
Which variance bred to such a strife
within a little time,
That spighting still the heynousnesse
of Kenedoxus crime,
And thinking on the present want
of Pesistrate his aid,
(Whose presence was the cheifest staff
whereon their profit stayde:)
The kinsmen sought to take away
from Kenedox his r^ght,
And sundry times by force of arms
assaulting it with might*
In field appointed at the last
the conquest they attainde,
And forced Kenedox to fly,
and slew them that remainde:
Whereon the wretched Kenedox
was forced to leave the soil
For shame, that cowardly be fled,
and purchased had the foil
And therefore after long advise
he minded to arrive,
In Italy, where as ^e heard
Pesistrate was alive:
Determining that if ^e could
but once approach to sight
Of Pesistrate, to thrust him through,
and thence to take his flight.
And thus supposing, did provide
to do as he deuisde:
And after his arriual at
Tarentum, he surmysde,
At first to execute the same,
but in a further space,
When he had wi^tlyer pe^vsde
and thought upon the case:
And seen the danger that would rise,
if rashely he were bent
To slay his brother in such wise,
as was his first intent.
He then determined to deforme
himself, disfiguring clean
Each part he might, supposing so
as by a secret mean,
To be as servant entertaynd
of Pesistrate, whereby
He might in secret work the feate
that he did mean to try.
His beard he cut, and shavde his head,
and used strange attire,
And after each thing ^it preparde,
he boldly did aspyre
To presence of Pesistratus,
who solitary was,
With book in hand, in garden set,
the tedious time to pass:
To whom the Kenedox with grace
and gesture well disp^sde,
(His salutations friendly made)
his meaning thus disclosde:
Oh worthy Knight, thy raised fame
has sounded to mine ears,
The which has movde me boldly thus,
deuoyde of doubted tears,
To crave thy curtesy to yield
such (...) unto ^^e,
As th^^ I might a happy man,
be intertaind of thee:
Whose service more I do esteem
than princes equal sta^e,
Or bondage better than the best
of fortunes flattering fate.
To whom (quoth Pesistrate) my friend*
a stranger thou do seem*
Of modest meekness, wile conceyt,
and gesture as I deem:
And for as much as I can judge
no otherwise of thee,
But that should well maintain my hope
I grant and do agree
To thy request, and what thy power
can further for mine ease,
To do the same with willing heart,
it shall my fancy please.
This sayd^ Pesistratus, but least
he did suspect the guile
That lurked under flattring phrase
and poysnous pleasant style,
By^a^se that he persuaded was
that Kenedox was slain,
As with his eyes he also saw
his latest fatal pain:
As likewise thought he that the man,
had been a Troyan borne,
Because his beard and naked head
was in such manner shorn:
Whereon he made him privy straight
what things did appertain
Unto himself, and whereunto
he should employ his pain:
And then demanding of his name,
that Antropos it hight
The servant said, which Pesistrate
esteemed to be right.
And thus the wicked wretch has brought
as erst he did require,
Unto a perfect purposde end
the full of his desire:
Whose further pranks to be declard
hereafter shall ensue,
And now Cataneas ceaseless cares
my travel shall renew:
Who stinteth not, but even as erst
she spent her lothed days,
So still the countenance of her wealth
upon Pesistrate s^ayes.
And lingering out the lazy time,
when Tytans glittring face
Forsaken had to show him self,
incroching couching place,
And Phoeb^, did succeed in room,
and Sopor claymde his right,
Catanea viewes in drousy dream,
as though in ce^tayne sight
Pesistrate sitting on a bank
with pleasant flowers decked:
To whom a Serpent did approach,
of Hyd^as fearful sect,
With hundred heads and thousand tongs,
which struck with such a force,
Pesistratus, that it seuerde
his head from deadly corpse:
Which so dismaide the drousy dame,
that having not such pour
As to perceive it for a dream,
she lay in trance an hour,
Before that vital course could be
recovered to his place,
Or sense had sense to understand
the sondnesse of the case?
And when (...) from her sound
she was, for very fear
Each limme did quake and tremble, such
her grievous dolors were:
Bewayling woefully her fates,
that fortune was inclinde,
For to increase such double cares
to ouerpresse hi^ mind:
Til Titan had from East appeard,
and raysde him self again,
And then the Lady rose from couch
and ceased to complain.
And began advisedly to think
that dreams were but abuse,
Whereon to better ease approcht,
she does disdain to muse
Thereon, but calls Pesistratus
to mind, and does renew
How that the wight, as abject wretch
was clad in taunie hue,
Which does pretend, that he did love,
and could not that attain,
That should intend his loyal faith
for to requite again:
And thus supposing of the thing,
which as a pleasant bait
Did feed her fancy and incroche
upon her humor straight
Oh seemly wight Pesistratus,
thryse happy is the dame
(Quoth she) whom thou so love, as for
her sake thou wearst the same:
Her joys surmount unto the heavens,
her comforts pierce the skies:
Or else I deem the blinded wretch
dame natures gifts defies:
Would to the Gods, it were my self
to whom thou do employ
Thy heart, then happy might I think
that greater were my joy
Than Alexanders hye renown,
or Dame Mineruas fame.
Alas replyde she then, what more
vnlikelier than the same?
Unlikely why? I know my state
and wealth as great as his:
But does Cupido wealth respect
or look where riches is?
No, no, alas, what motion then
prouokes thee to such hope?
Thou know that love at randon runs,
and Cupid shoots at scope,
Oh truth (she said) and then, as though
a woman pressed to dye,
Small hope I have yet some, because
his gestures did discry
Of late his mind with paled face
and count^ ^aunce sodain^ changde,
When as I viewd his blood discourst
and a^ his humors rangde.
And t^us her fancy with her self
di^ question* til at last,
Di^payre not Catane (she said)
nor be no more aghast:
But since thou see, thy lover is
in ^aunie colors dressed*
Wear thou the like* that he may judge
the cause of thine unrest.
Whereto agreed, she did proceed
to execute her will:
Whom thus I leave and shall resign
to Pesistrate my quil:
Who still consumes the tedious time
in tears and ceaseless woes,
And dare not once (unhappy man)
his cause of cares disclose
To any wight, but to himself
in secret does complain,
Whereby the more he does provoke
his mot^ons unto pain,
Til that in curssed time, by chance
as he bewayling was,
His new come servant Antropos,
by chamber door did pas:
And ^earing t^us his master moan,
did (entering there) e^pye
The seely man on ^ossed bed
as ready bent to dye:
To whom the caytife K^nedox,
in^ending naught but guyle,
With bauty phrase and bidden gloss
adorned thus his sti^e:
Alas my Lord, from what disease
proceeds this thy care?
What is the vexing cursed cause
that grieved thus you ar^?
Has loss of goods distempered,
or faithful friends thy state?
Or has impoisned fortune fround
and spyghted thee of late?
Or has the seemly sight of Dame
disquieted thy head,
Whereby thy fixed fancy is
by blinded Cupid led?
Inform thy servant of thy cause
of cares, and if his power
May do thee good, it is ^esdy pressed:
and if that fortune ^oure,
Forbear the same with patience,
and season shall requite
In time again, when fortune leaves
to profer further spyte:
And if that love assail thy youth,
attend what I shall say,
And scorn not counsel, neither let
advise be set away:
For (...) it has been seen, the blind
in safety sure to pass
The place whereas the seeing man
has feign and burst his face.
And sometime may a wise man be
advised by a fool,
As does a whetstone serve to sharp,
but is no caruing tool.
If love I say, so trouble thee,
my loving Lord beware,
Least nusling, thou thy self be trapte
in loves intangling snare:
And way, that if thou love, thy love
with equal love be plast,
For hye ascendyng gettes a fall,
and weakness is defast:
And since occasion forces thee
to faynte through chanced fate,
Comfort thy heavy heart, and eke
support thy drousy pate
With hope, and season shall display
the proof of hope in time,
When fearful fancy shall be fled,
though not in present pryme.
For how might ever sugrie sap
be known, if bitter taste
Had nere been felt, or pleasant bait
were nere addicte to wast?
How wealth, if never woes were wist?
how health if never harm?
Or what man can descerne the cold
which never knew the warm?
Give therefore place to pain, and that
shall pleasure bring at last,
As diverse savors teach, the true
experience of a taste:
And hope as I do hope, which is,
to see the happy day,
That thou shall full enjoy thy wish,
thy sorrows worn away:
And leave thy couch, and seek the means
clean to avoid thy care,
For lying thus, thou do increase
thy dolorous misfare.
And worthy Pesistratus, mark
and ponder well my words:
A man with pain may beat the bush,
and other catch the birds.
So may thou thus increase thy griefs,
decreasing still thy strength
And lusty force, when other men
shall get thy game at length.
Were this the way to win thy will?
were this the wi^est act
That thou may do, so to abuse
thy wits by foolish fact?
No, no, thy wealth will wear away,
thy force will fainte and fail,
Thy sorrows will augment defame,
and nothing thee avail:
Rise therefore up, with courage arms
and fortify thy case,
Polish thy parts with healthful hope,
avoid this loathsome place,
And either seek such means thy self,
as may exyle thy grief,
Or else let servant use his pain
to purchase thy relief,
Who shall, by death and life (I vow)
for thy desired ease,
Both venture life, and suffer death,
and present life displease.
That all, Pesistrate noted well,
and pondred in his heart
An answer, viewing in his deed
what were his wisest part:
And in coniecturing, thought at first
to hold his secret deep,
Considering that the Fox does wixck
when often he faynes to sleep:
But afterward respecting much,
the earnest^esse did seem
To be in talk of Antropos,
because he could not deem
No otherwise than mere good will
to move his zealous phrase,
And marking that his counsel was
as needeful to his ways,
Without suspect, alas: the Knight
his secrets did disclose
In end to Antropos, and thus
his woeful speech arose:
What sudden tickle chance has charmd
thy footsteppes to the place,
To see thy friend tormented thus,
and vexed before thy face:
Whom every creature does disdain,
and comfort does refuse,
And every tormente, with his pain
and penury does use?
It Is neither want of worldly wealth,
nor lack of earthly store,
Nor loss of friends nor frowning face
of fortunes fickle lore.
That makes me spend my doleful days
in such excess of tears,
But Antropos, alas, alas,
it is thy trembling fear*
The doubtful hope, the cold conceits,
the ceaseless burning broils
Of lovers fits, that I sustain,
and thus my stomach toils,
And still alas I strain, as much
as in my power does lie,
Yet aye, the more I strive, the more
I feel my force to dye,
And thus I live in deep despair,
and have no cause to joy,
But drink my death, and feed of air,
and breed mine own anoy,
Whereon I can not think my pain
his pleasure will induce,
Because no pleasure can depend
upon mine own abuse.
I gayn, my hope is so defast,
and I my self attain
Unto such little cause of hope,
that hope is most my pain.
And though all this I know, yet grief
so much does me suppress,
That I not able am to seek
or work for my redress,
Thus see thou Antropos, so much
unhappy is my state,
That thy advise is frustrate all,
and council come to late.
Wherefore as cause does move my cries,
so forced I do complain,
And have no cause to set me free
or these my greefes restrain
Yet for as much as I perceive
what wisdom is in thee,
And how thou tenderly bewaylst
my case, and fauorest me,
(O Antropos) I shall declare
to thee my secrets all,
And how by due desert, I have
attaind to this my fall.
In Appollonia, Grecian Soil,
a town of raised fame
I borne a worthy father had,
Aganetos his name,
Who tendering so his loving sons
as much as father might,
Whereof I one, an other was,
who Kenedoxus hight:
And when that crooked age encrocht
upon our ancient Sire,
The father did with trickling tears
of us his sons require,
Like valiants to withstand the rage
of Tetimetians pride,
(Who were our foes) as he before
their hautie hearts (...) tryde,
Disposing unto Kenedox
his lands, as due by right
They were: and unto me, what so
of foes we got by fight:
And stinting so the aged Sire
from seat to earth declynde,
And taking death, unto the heavens
his spirits he resinde.
Whom in due time we laid in earth,
and then did both consent,
To work for foes despite, whereto
our mutual wills were bent:
And in a space as we requirde,
we met our foes in face:
And in the skirmish ouerc^me
their pride in pointed place,
And slew each man, save those which fled,
whereby when so the soil
They purchasde had, by right I claymde
their lands, in forsayde soil
Containd, because by fathers will
they were disposde to me.
But to this same, my brother would
in no wise once agree,
Whereat our kinsmen were displeasd
with Kenedox, and said,
That since it was my right, the same
should be to me conuayd:
But he as much displeasde again,
and fretting in his ire,
Departed thence in wrath, because
he mist of his desire:
Whom viewing I, so fiercely set,
supposing to persuade,
Did follow fast but when I seen
of him, with deadly blade
He meeting, thought me to have slain
in that his hasty made,
Whose rigor viewd, with Rapier drawn
in hand, I him withstoode:
And movde by this occasion just
to anger, caitife vile
(Quod I) would thou in brothers blood
so cowardly defi^e
Thy filthy fists? an^ art thou meant
to seek thy friends decay?
If so, in a convenient place
and on appointed day
Agree to get revenge, and seek
thy quarrel to renew,
And I this blade in traytorous blood
of shine shall there imbrue:
To w^^^ agreede, he vowed by Saints
to meet: and time approcht,
Wherein each foe his brothers corpse
with bloody blade incrocht,
In further fight I slew the knight,
whereon in have I fled,
And toward these Italian parts,
through seas in ship was led.
And when arivde I was, such fate
allotted to my pay,
That wandering up and down, not known,
and knowing not the way,
By chance I met an ancient sire,
with countnance very grave,
And sobre gesture, unto whom
intelligence I gave
Of my affairs, and whilst that such
discourse of talk did pass,
In forest by, Pecipater
with other hunting was
A monstrous Lion, whom so long
the coursers chased had,
That flinging Lion forest left,
came toward us as mad,
With whom incountring I bestowd
such blows, as at the last,
His rage abated, him I slew,
and so the danger past.
And by this means acquainted grew
with chasers Knightly rout,
But chiefly with Pecipater,
with whom, as it fell out,
I did repair to present place,
which place has wrought my pain,
And feeds my fancy, as thou see,
with poisnous pleasant baine:
For Pecipater worthy man
a sister has, who hight*
Catanea, a Phoenix rare,
a peerless dame by right,
Whose seldom beauty has dismayed
so much my wandering wits,
That will I ^il I, forced I am
to suffer these my fits,
Accursing the unhappy time,
that ere my footesteps trod
Italian ground, or that my life
so long has here abode:
As eke the time that ere I vseud
that glittring face of ^its,
Whose b^aui^es blase, I dare auow
does dim the twinkling stars.
Thus have I told thee ( Antropos)
the cause of my anoy,
My present state, and vexing griefs,
and ouerpassed joy:
Which al these pains, I do confess,
of this the present time,
I do deserve* and thousands more
for former foresaid crime:
And thee and none else have I made
so privy to the same,
My secrets wherefore keep thou close,
and yield me no more blame*
And so he stint to speak and ^eares
did trickle dow^^ the face
Of silly man and quaking fear
dis^^mperd every place
So much that wretched wight he stood
in such amazed muse,
As though his sprites were fully bent
his body to refuse.
Whom Antropos beholding, thus
did craftily reply,
With tongue dessembling under which
the mischief al did lie:
My Lord alas, I much lament
to see thy doleful days
In irksome cares so vainly spent,
whilst hauty fame and praise
Might be thy gain, through knighthod shown,
refuse this loathsome trade
Of lazy life, in singring woes*
and let thy sorrows vade.
For since it is but love, that moves
thy stomach to such pain,
No doubt we shall prevent the harms,
and well enough restrain
The further mischief that would grow
throught want of wise forcast,
By travel such as shall intend
to work thy wealth at last:
Thou know that nothing is so dark,
but labor does epsy,
And naught so stout, but travel may
suppress, if it will try:
And wherefore then will thou despair?
or why does drousie doubt
So drown thy senses, that thou thus
forsakst the courtly rout,
And yeeldst thy carcass to thy couch,
as one who seek to crave
His lazy ease, or to be laid
in his desired grave?
Is this the way to move the minds
of Ladies to surmise
Upon thy manhood, or the means
to make thy fixed eyes
Of lowly stomachs to respect
thy person? or the way
To yield thee fame through due deserts,
or purchase lovers pray?
No no, thou know: then shame to use
such means as do allure
Thy present hindrance in such things
as feign thou would procure.
And now forsake thy drousie bed,
and use such fit attire,
As seems requisite and apt
for loving, thy desire:
For Catane in (...) hue
is clad of late and why?
Mai^t thou not judge it does as well
like love of hirs discry
As of thine own? renew thy heart
and let not courage quail,
Hope well and have well, so they say,
naught have, if naught assail:
And write thy mind with plaintiff pen
unto thy Ladies grace,
Beseeching comfort for thy cares,
and favor for thy case:
And I thy secret servant, shall
in secret al convey
Unto her hands, this is the best,
this is the wisest way.
For otherwise thou ceaseless may
continue in thy grief,
And still bewail, and yet be void
of comfort or relief.
Thou wisely say (quod Pesistrate)
and I with willing heart,
To follow this thy good advise
will prosecute my part:
Though yet, alas, I may perceive
that al is but in vain,
Because presumption plainly shows
presumption of disdain?
As also if I should fail,
what mischief would succeed,
And what rebuke unto my shame
would follow for my deed?
Yet try I will, for sure I am
my Lady will not prove,
Though hirs surpassed my good will
or flamd in hotter love.
And therwithall the trembling wight,
on crouching knees declinde,
Wit^ lifted ^andis unto the skies
his prayers thus resinde.
Oh mighty love, with heavenly ghost
my spirits now indue,
Give uttering gift, that sugared pen
may so my griefs renew,
As that my faithful meanings may
requited be again
With some remorse of loyal love:
and so he stint to strain
His further speech: and then with pen
pouided in his hand,
Thus did the wretch discribe his case
subdude to beauties band.
Pesistratus letter to his Lady.
AVVoful wight whose curelesse cares
compel him to complain,
Whose fancy fixed fast, is fed
upon Cupidos baine,
Whose doubtf^l dumps of deep despair,
have dround in dull anoy
His heavy heart, and can attain
to no desired joy,
Has boldly made assault, to save
(if fortune do consent,
And favor from your tender b^est
in gentle wise b^ bent)
The life which erst depend on death,
and panted in the pains
Of latest fits, and now through hope
some sappie sense sustayns.
If faithful Troylus had a cause
with tears for to bewail
His fates, when first Cupidos cares
his stomach did assail,
Or Tantalus the wretched wight
his dolours to disclose,
Or else the furies to declare
their pangs they may suppose
I Pesistratus motion have
to utter forth my smart,
Whose grifes excede each other pain
that ever pincht the heart:
And (oh Catanea) all these things
I suffer for thy sake,
Whose favor doubting I should find,
does cause each limme to quake:
Let therefore pity yield his power
from tender loving breast,
In speedy have to cure my cares,
and yield thy lover rest.
Which if thy grace do grant to give,
my stomach shall intend,
A faithful lover for to live
til life does take his end:
But if I fail of that I would,
then thrice accursed, I
Have no refuge, but glad to yield
my lothed limbs to dye.
And thus, my simple suit disclosde,
and pity cr^^de, I leave
our grace, and to the hiest heavens
your person I bequeane.

THis was the sum of the complaint,
which with his proper fist,
That worthy Pesistratus wrote,
who could not cares resist:
But after this his finished work,
(...) is woes renewd again,
(...) (as ^rst, ^o likewise now)
(...) tumble in his pain,
(...) what defaine would fall,
(...) case not mornde,
His earnest suit, and such requests
of Ladies grace were scornde.
And thereupon, in deep despair
the wretch would thus have rent
The paper straight, wherein but erst
his travel he had spent,
Had it not bin for Antropos,
whose guileful words assurde,
That hope renewd, to Pesistrate
his fancy he procurde
To grant again in hope of grace
the same to be conuayde
By Antropos, as was deuisde:
whereon he then thus said:
Amidste despair a little hope
informing fancies fears
Of happy favor, I have dewde
the paper with my tears,
And decked it in the careful robes
of lovers cursed case,
Sustaynde by sighs, and fed by sobbes,
I live through hope of grace.
Thus say, the woeful wight has said,
and let not to declare,
How still I lie, and yet I live,
and what my dolours are.
And so he ceast to speak, and gulfes
of griesly gripes arose,
That feeble man, was faynting, forced
his senses strength to lose,
Til time again resigned had
due sap to v^tal vains:
Wherein Pesistrate left, amidst
his cares and pinching payns,
His servant Antropos aryues
to long desired place,
Where Catane remaynd, and spies
her happy wished face:
To whom approached, greeting well,
the servant did prepare,
With filed tongue, to Lady thus
his message to declare:
The most y^ossed woeful wretch
who Pesistratus hight,
Has wyld my travel to present
these letters to your sight,
Beseeching humbly, that your grace
with pity would respect
His cursed case, the which with cares
is woefully bedeckt:
And he amazde, as though of wits
distraught with fancies filld,
So frounst in midst of Cupides flames
which has his heart distillde,
Like sauorie sap of fruitful herb
which meltes in vessel where
The fuming fire does force the same
a watrie substance bear,
That neither health, ne wealth, ne rest,
the seelye soul sustaynes,
But only freezeth in his fears,
and burns in his pains.
Which said, the courteous Lady did
to Antropos replye,
That letters red, to morrow next,
her answer should discry
Her meanings, wishing Pesistrate
no otherwise to deem,
But that her friendship should incline
his proffers to esteem:
For which a thousand thanks returned,
the servant does retire,
And tells his Master, al fell out
according to desire:
And how the dame with wisling heart
receyvde the letters sent,
And that with profferd service she
was very well content,
With promise made, that answer should
tomorrow make requite
Of his good will, as should intend
to move him to delight:
Which Pesistratus hearing, was
the ioyfulst man alive,
So motiond to such sudden joys,
as pen can not descriue
The lively fancies that he felt,
nor yet the heart suppose
His happy state, nor his conceits
no trouling tongue disclose:
But as a mortal, clean renewde
from earthly irksome cares
To heavenly joys, so Pesistrate
(thrice happy man) he fares.
Wherefore he blist the fruitful womb
from whence he did proceed,
And eke the pappes that gave him suck,
and sustnance that did feed
His nourisht limbs, and eke the day
whereon he took his flight
From native soil, Dame Nature eke
who yielded him his sight,
With all the furtherers of life:
but most he blist the Dame,
Who was the cause, that happy he
was movde to bliss the same:
And then: you furies al (quoth he)
receive your due again,
I have no cause to wayle with you,
I scorn your drousie pain.
You pleasant Nymphs, come you and aid
the blessed to paynt his joys,
And let the cursed caytifs plain,
bewayling their anoyes.
But pausing then a while: when time
had somewhat made delay
Of sudden such conceived joys,
be then began to say:
Oh cursed caytife, what abuse
has blinded wandering wits?
What cause has movde thee so to use
such unadvised fits?
Have thou receiude of Ladies grace
in writing her good will,
So blasde as nothing can disprove
the same? No, no: distill
Then from the watrish eyes thy tears,
let sighs go fly apase,
To maintain that which thou have wrote,
according to thy case:
And rather yield thee to thy couche,
as erste, for to bewail:
For likelyhoodes uncertain be,
and fickle hope will fail:
And those thy letters so receiude,
the Lady does retain,
To show thy fondness for a scoff,
for sure she does disdain
Thy simple service, and does scorn
thy bold presumptuous suit,
And means to yield for thy defame
the same to common brute:
Whereby the pride should be espyde
and lewdness should be blown
Through every care, that thy abuse
of each man might be known.
And do thou then conceive a cause
as though of luckie hap,
When so thy fondness is displayde
in every taunters lap?
Oh blinded fool^, dispatch thy life
more rather, with thy blade,
And let in breast with percing knife
thy latest wound be made,
And therewythall to that intent
be ready was to draw
For his dispatch: but pondring then
again when well he saw
His vain perose, reuoking sense
from errors further thral,
Oh wretch (quoth he) and would thou so
obtain thy proper fall?
Do thou not know the Lady is
of gentle courteous kind,
Of wise behavior, and discrete,
and of a lowly mind?
And do thou then suppose that she
would work thee such defame?
No, no, in judging so thou art
unhappy much to blame.
And much unworthy to receive
the thing thou do require,
Since to thy Lady such abuse
thy stomach does aspire:
Is It not enough for riddance of
thy tedious irksome grief,
Of Ladies mouth, that Ladies grace
shall soon be thy relief?
And can thou not a season stay
to take thy wished joy,
When thou have spent long tract of time
in case of much anoy?
Let reason rule thy sense for shame,
and bridle wandering will,
And shun such foolish forcing cause
as does provoke thine ill.
Thus said Pesistratus, and then
at somewhat better ^ase,
His hap bequeathed unto hope,
his dolours do appease:
And fed by hope and yet in doubt
and sundry sudden fears,
In wandering motions void of stay
the lingering time he wears:
Whom I resign in such his fits
and shall intend to paint,
As simple vttrance can declare,
the joys that did attaint
The beautiful Catanea,
who after message done
Of Antropos, to secret place
approaching, (dolors won)
Did so record her happy haps,
that pen may not express
The force of those her joyful fits,
which did her heart address
To happy state, as woman erst
to every dolor yokt,
And now with peerless joys possessed,
to gladfull cheer prouokt,
Whose luckie fates so frounsed had
her senses in delight,
That trickle tears, for happy joy,
distild: and yet no sight
She had of secrets that should be
in letters there reposde,
But kissed the same a thousand times
before it was disclosde:
And then with dainty finger, she
attempted to reveal
The same, but first with sugry lips
she kissed again the seal,
And then with gasing greedy sight
the letters did pervse
A hundred times, before she could
agree for to refuse
The same, her comforts so arose
through foresaid letters sent,
That she not able was, from them
her fancy to relent.
For season long til senses were
so much therein it often,
The humor ^ed his fill, the dame
for joy began to bost
(With happy wights) her happy state*
whose comforts did excel
(As she supposde) each life, whereto
no comfort did rebel.
Whereon the Lady forced her joys
surpassing to compare,
The Phoenix began her happy fates
and case for to declare
With hauty voice, and thus she said:
oh fortuna^est day
That ever past in earthly globe,
oh sweetest purchased pray
That ever lover has attaind:
whose haps excel my joys?
Whose riddance is more better made
than mine from my anoyes?
Who lives in happier plight than I?
who spends the lucky tide,
In better bliss? whose case is more
than mine by cares defide?
Whom favors fortune more than me?
whom has she more aduaunst?
Whose loyal love is more than mine
by loyal love inhaunst?
Whose lovers seemelynesse does pass
my comely loving Knights?
No, no, none cause like me to joy,
none lives in more delights.
Most happy therefore be the tide
that ere I saw the face
Of Pesistrate that peerless wight,
and viewde his portly grace?
And blessed be his gentle heart,
whose loyal love has brought
Unto my state more ease, than all
the Gods could have ywrought,
Thus said the dame, and pausing then
again, unhappy wretch
Quod she, what meanest thou (by this)
thy slender throat to stretch
In such disguised sort? what toys
assaulted have thy head?
That want of reason al this while
thy wandering wits has led?
What though Pesistratus has made
so feigned a complaynt?
Is this suffici^nt to allure
that favor should attaint
Thy stomach straight? oh Catane
do thou not know the guile
Of men's abuse? and do thou not
perceive this subtle wile:
And art thou yet to learn their trade?
is practice out of use?
Or do thou deem, that now disdain
does scorn the like abuse?
No, no, their faind deceits abound,
their snares be daily laid,
And al their travel and their speech
to trapping trade conuaid.
And yet, when yielded love is lent
unto their faind request,
They seem to skorne this is their use,
to make thereof a jest.
And thus by nature they addict,
mind naught but women's shame,
And midst the rest of skoffing routs
they most deride the same.
For offered they do much detest,
and coyed grace they crave,
Which when by long complaints and suits
in end they purchased have,
They do reject, as not content
therewith, or else disdain
To use their love so stately bent
as nature would maintain.
And though by chance they now and then
do make a matched ma^e
Unto themselves, of Lady such
as does adorn their state,
When tract of time has made delay
of their inflamed fits,
Then Tigres like, they do surmise
and settle spiteful wits,
To make a thralled slave of her
whom erst they did retain
As for their mate, this is their guise
to work their lovers pain:
And thus they either always feign
to purpose our reproach,
By scoffed folly: or disdain
the love they did incroche:
Or else reject the dame, which erst
he sude, through hautie pride,
As who should say, so trim a man
was he, as not denide:
Or else attained to their wish*
they make their Ladies thral
Unto their fickle wills: and thus
our folly frames our fall.
Should therefore I, whose hautie fate
does stand at certain ease,
So much my noble birth abase,
and present wealth displease,
And purchase shame and leest renown,
as so to put in yoke
To needy slave, my pressed neck,
whose usage may provoke
My noble heart to servile state,
and press my honor down,
Whereby my duties al decay,
and leesing my renown,
I should be scoff to every tongue
and as a common blame
To every taunter? no, I scorn
the cause of such defame:
And rather than I would agree
to such abused thought,
My fatal web of sisters three
again shall be unwrought.
Thus earnest was the Lady then
against her former mind,
Yet pausing now a while, the dame
was contrary declinde:
And thinking how she rashly vowed
against her former will,
Which likewise was with solemn oath
confirmd, the tears did tril
From trickling eyes, as drops of deaw
descending to the ground,
And she dismayed, as though addressed
to deadly dampish swound.
From heavy heart with doleful cheer
renewd for to complain,
And to her former rash conceits
replied thus again:
Oh faithless wench, do thou deserve
a loyal lovers heart
For to enjoy? who wavering thus
art blown to every part.
Or deemst thou it as possible,
such currishnesse to find
In Pesistrate, whose outward shape
declares his courteous kind?
Or do thou think that each is bent
to work his lovers thrall,
Because that some men take delight
to purchase others fall?
No, no, thy lewdness is deceyvde,
thrice cursed thou art movde
To speak in men's behalf, since so
of man thou art beloude,
And not so gratelesse to requi^e
thy love with such disdain,
Which does pretend, that womankind
is rather bent to feign*
Shame such abuse, and settle once
thy wits at certain castle,
And now provide to answer that
Pesistratus request,
With such a constant loving heart
as he does seem to bear,
Who spendes the tedious time through hope
of grace in painful fear.
And leaving then, with further speech
the time for to delay,
She began devise such meek conceit
as plainly might convey
Her loving heart to Pesistrate,
whereon with happy quill
In happy time, the Lady thus
did write her constant will.
The letter of Catanea to her Lover.
THy loving letters Pesistrate,
thou seemly wight attainde
Unto my sight, thy Lady has
with happy hand restrainde:
And wishing to thy person wealth
and cause of ceaseless joys,
Her heavy heart has much bewailde
thy former long annoyes,
At present time, with yielded love
requiting gentle grace,
Of thine abundant, with as much
as may supply thy case.
And though thy pangs surpast the pain
that lurk in Plutos lake,
Thou never suffredst half like griefs
or passions for my sake,
As I for thy misdoubted love
have suffered deadly smart,
Whose least vexation able was
to tear the strongest heart.
And though thy love as loyal be,
as Troy^us faith in Troy,
Or else as earnest as it raines
in breast of blinded Boy,
I dare auow my fyred heart
in equal live to flame,
Which fixed fast unto my faith,
thou only reapst the same,
And only shall whylst lingering life
does vital course maintain,
Or else damnation be my due,
and Plutos forge my gain.
Thus to thy wish I do aspire,
and grant thy whole request,
And to perform each cravde desire
of thine, mine heart is prests
And therefore briefly to conceive
as I have briefly wrote,
That neither tract of time, nor pain,
shall make thee once forgote,
But aye for to be shrinde in breast,
and borne in constant mind,
Whilst carkas left, unto the skies
my spirits be resynd:
And for because I long to view
thy comely courteous face,
I have deuisde, that wide of each
suspect, in secret place
Thou might repair, where mutual hearts
moy joy their happy own:
The time appointed, and the place
is to thy servant shown.
Thy only own, whilst life does last,
til breath be gone, til sense be past.

THis when the Lady finished had,
reuovlde in mazed muse,
Why rather did I not (quoth she)
at first seem to refuse
His proffred service, and to coy
to make the matter strange,
Whereby I might provoke his love
more hotter for to range:
Than thus to show thy self so bound
unto the wight again,
Declaring for his wished love
my former forcing pain?
Whereto she pausing did reply,
that faithful hearts should frame
Each thing so faithful, as it should
deserve no joy of blame.
And so content, with softened wax
the letters she does seal,
And kissed them: to secret breast
of hirs, she does repose
The same, whilst servant were approcht
at due appointed tide,
Who present come to that intent,
and of the Lady spyde,
Receyvde the letters, with advise
of foresaid time and place,
Whereas both met, the lover might
determine full, the case:
And with a thousand greetings sent
unto the worthy wight,
The servant homewards did repair
apace, and meets the Knight,
To whom he yeeldes the paper sent,
as also does discry,
The pointed place and present tide
whereto he should apply
His journey made, but oh the joys
the happy man conceivde.
When these thus luckie news he had
and letters were bequeadde,
I deem the Gods had no such cause
or motions to be glad,
As in that ten times b^essed time
the joyful man he had.
It were therefore but frustrate, that
I further should pretend
His happy haps for to discribe,
or fancies to extend,
Since heavenly powers can scarce comprise,
I deem, the wondrous joys,
That fed his fancy with delights
of sundry pleasant toys,
Wherein he spent the altered time,
til Titan had resinde
Himself to west, and left the clokes
of pitchy clouds behind,
And then again recoursed was,
and had his streams displayde
In open East, on fertile earth,
and gladful light conuayde.
Wherein the Lovers, loathsome couch
forsaken, do prepare
To meet in happy pointed place,
and gorgeously they are
In silken robes of costly price
arayde and ready pressed,
As lovers such as for the nonce
their seemly sightes addressed,
And after journey, are aryvde
to foresaid joyful place,
Whereas the Knight his Lady met,
does kiss and then embrace.
Whom likewise she a hundred times
rekist and kissed again,
And he requited every one
by one, yet took no pain.
That who had seen the seemly sight
of lovers there so blazed
With comely corpse and princely port,
be wondering would (amazde)
Have musde, that nature could have made
such artificial show,
Or that such imps of heavenly hew
from earthly globe should grow.
And thus the lovers ruld the time
to their desired joy.
And made discourse of al their haps,
and blist, that banished joy,
They had attaynde to happy wish:
til seasons tickle trade
Approchte, of force (against their wills)
departure must be made.
Wherein, with parting kiss they past,
appointing time renewde,
When there in present place again
each other might be viewde:
And at departure, fixed fast
their eyes for to behold
Each others presence wislly markte,
so vttrance did unfold
Of lovely use, each loving heart
as long as time would let,
Upon each others comely corpse
their eyesights to be set.
And thus departed, both yclad
in like adorned hewes,
They spend the time at wished ^ase,
as still the time renewes,
And often thus they used to meet,
and long their joys retainde,
Til at the last, oh cursed case,
their customs were restraynde
By villayne servant Antropos,
whose long disguised guyle
Has now at last attempted, wrought
the lovers joys exile.
Come come, Alecto therefore, thou
unhappy caytyfe, teach
My drousie verse, the diuelishe wyles
of this unhappy wretch,
Whose rankrous heart devising long
to work Pesistrats pain,
Had now a^^^te convenient time
to charm his poysnous baine.
For when the villayne had supposde
what suare he might invent,
Thus bring privy to the chief
of all their whole intent,
And pondring what displeasure might
to Pesistrate arise,
If that his secret love were known,
the miser did devise
How to disclose to uncle of
Catanea the same,
With further forged tale, that might
engender greater blame.
Whereon app^^cht to Phetratus
her uncle so he hight,
With tale prepared for the no^^e
thus vttred he his spite:
SIr Phetratus the earnest zeal^
I bear to thy estate,
And eke the length of long success
I wish unto thy fate*
Has made me boldly to presume,
my travel to address,
As for a w^^^ing unto the^*
least treason should suppress
Thy quiet wealth: and understand,
that Pesistrate is bente,
Conspired with Catanea,
who yielded has consent,
Ere it be long to seek thy death
and reave thy vital life,
Either by pampered poison, or
by secret bloody knyfe.
For as by chance I musing sat
alone in secret place,
I herd these two, presuming thus
upon the traytrous case,
And Pesistratus (holding in
his arms Catanea) say,
I would not have this toy my love
no whit at al, dismay
Thy doubtful head, for naught I care
for Phetratus consent,
But have devised well enough,
the mischiefs to prevent
That he may work, to let our love:
from hence not far remayns,
A Grecian seely man, who lives
in ceaseless extreme payns
Through sickness, which has long suppressed
his wished health, and he
Of late for hyre of certain sum*
did willingly agree
For to begin in p^^sned cup
to Phetratus, whereby
Both he himself and Phetratus,
through poison drunk should dye:
The seely man to gain of gold
so vehemently desires,
To leave unto his simple son,
and gladly he aspires
To dye, because his pains extreme
so vexed the weried wight,
That boyde of health he can attain
to rest ne day ne night.
And by this means, our greatest foe
shall soon dispatched be,
And we attain to happy day
the which we long to see.
This said Pesistrate, and I heard
Catanea reply,
That it was polis^kely thought,
aduising him to try
The subtle feate in present space,
and not for to delay
But do it in as speedy have
as possible he may.
This with mine ears I heard sir knight,
and will auow the same
Upon my body to the death
unto the traitors shame:
And that you may for certain know
my former talk as true,
I heard the Lovers point the place
and time for to renew
Their traytrous will: unto which place
if you with armed rout
Proceed, there may you clean dissolve
the causes of your dout.
And apprehend the traitors both
at ease, deuoyde of fear,
Where you should do but to desert
if that with point of spear
You pearsed Pesistratus sides.
Thus had the caytife told
His forged tale, and now a space
does tatling tongue withold,
To hear what Phetratus would say,
whose answer thus was made:
Oh grisly griping gulfes of grief,
that stomach do invade:
Is exile slave Pesistratus
so cowardly disposde
To work my death, before he dare
to have his grutch disclosde?
And is Catanea so bente
to seek her uncles spoil,
Whose long regard has had respect
to her suspected foil?
And has she chosen for her mate
a slave, whose like abuse
As this, has causde the wandering wight
his country to refuse?
Well, well, for Pesistratus grutch
and Catanes dispite,
By saints I vow, with present death
I shall them both requite:
And since the laws of this our soil
be thus, that who so lays
To others charge conspiracy,
must answer those assayes
(Because ^e wants witness) first
with solemn oath to swear,
That witness to be sincere, just
and true, that he does bear:
And then to bow no further grutch
or spite, to cause the same,
But only for his conscience sake,
deuoyd of every blame:
And last, that he confirm the proof
thereof, with manhood tried
In courtly combat, him against
of whom it is denide^
I do advise thee Antropos,
the trial to withstand
With manly courage, and my self
shall ready pressed at hand
Give aid to thee, if succoure need,
and all the slaves defy
In thy behalf, wherein by Saints
I mean to live and die.
And I intend as thou have said,
the lovers for to meet
In pointed place, whose courtesy
I shall so friendly greet,
As both of them to lode with chains*
til Proclamation made
Of their conspiracy, thou shall
approve with manly blade,
(Against who so one, that does approach)
thy sayings to be (...):
Wherein I hope the wished death
of Traitors we shall view.
This said, left Phetratus to speak,
whom Antropos a space
Forsook, till season did require
that unto pointed place
They should aspire, for to behold
the lovers: but the cares
Of Phetratus, and woes to tell,
and how he doleful fares
Through his conceived griefs, it does
I deem each wit surpass,
The grievous dolors of his heart,
so passing painful was,
To think that Catane should seek
his death, whose cheifest pain
Was always bent from tender age
the Lady to restrain
For each mishap: and thus the wight,
complained, til such time
As ranckours rage dissuaded had
the man to muse of crime,
And now to presuppose revenge,
the which he did devise.
But midst of all these tossed thoughts,
it could not once aryie
To him, that tale of Antropos,
should fainde or forged be,
But still his fancy he informde,
that he should shortly see
The proof of al for to be true,
as Antropos had said:
And thus the wilful wretched wight
remayne^ so dismayde,
Tiil time again that Antropos
returnde, who present is
At season such, wherein they should
if that they would, no^ mis
Of lovers sight, straight hye in have
with every thing addressed
Thereto, whereon the wight^ provide
to have each purpose pressed,
And then they marched in secret sort,
and at the last drew nigh
Unto the place, where Lovers were,
whom there they might discry,
Inioying so their presence, as
the use of Lovers sect
Does take delight in likely case,
but naught they did suspect
(Alas) the mischief that did lurk,
whereon deuoyde of fear,
They still imbrast and sweetly kyst
in lurkers presence there.
Who cursed wretches, at the last
in rigor rushed out,
And took the Lovers al agaste,
suspecting no such dout.
And bound as traitors them they led
as Antropos deuisde,
To presence of Pecipater,
who at the first surmisde
Some spited grutch, and fainde abuse,
whereon with frowning face,
How dare you villains all (quoth he)
in such disguised grace,
Conduct my sister to my sight?
what heinous fault is done?
To whom Sir Phetratus replyde
what treason was begone,
And how that Antropos discryde
the same, who was content
Upon his body to approve
against who (that durst) was bent
For to deny the truth thereof,
(that) Pesistrate had sought
With Catane, hi^ uncles death
in secret to have wrought)
Which when Pecipater had heard,
considering what their use
And custom was: he would not seem
to move no more abuse,
Because that justice should take place,
and least his partial will
Should cause the people to suspecte,
some further cause of ill.
By tears distilling from his breast,
and sighs from heavy heart
Proceeding fast, the woeful man
from thence does straight depart
To secret chamber, where his griefs
so plenteously abound,
That seely man in desprate mind,
he tumbles on the ground,
As though distraught of wits, his pain
engendered such his smart:
And he supposing of these haps,
was vexed so in heart.
And thence the woeful lovers were
to several prisons led,
Whereas on hard Alectos food,
their heavy hearts are fed,
Bewayling their accursed fates,
that spighte should so prevail
To work their deaths, whose mutual wills
did never once assail
To do no ill, but only bent
their constant love to frame,
For loyal proof, did nere deserve
this thryce vnhapppie shame.
And only looking for the time
of death, deuoyd of joy,
With mournful tunes and painful plaints
bewayling their anoy,
They spend the drousie doleful day,
as ready pressed to pyne,
Through pinching sorrows, whom a while
I forced to refine
Unto their griefs, must now apply
my travel to pursue
The cares of Pecipaters case,
whose sorrows eke renew,
And he incessantly so vexed
that still he woeful lies
Bewayling Pesistratus woes
with sundry plaintiue cries,
Accursing fortunes tickle trade,
as eke the villains spite,
Whose accusation had defast
the fame and credit quite,
Not only of Pesistratus
and of his Sisters state,
But also of him self, whose wealth
depended on their fate.
Which well be waying* was inforst
with heavy heart to plain,
And was not able vexed man,
his dolours to restrain:
But after long pervsing of
his griefs, he payned said:
Oh blinded fool, what fond conceits
has made thee thus dismaide?
Do thou not know thy proper laws
be so, that who accusde
Of other is, because himself
by custom is refusde
To fight in proper his behalf,
he must a champion have,
Whose hand victorious must intend
the accuzeds life to save?
And why do thou not then prepare
more rather to provide,
In these the Innocents defense,
to have thy manhood tried,
Than for to grieve thy pined heart
in such a paineful guyse,
Which neither does pretend thy ease,
their help, nor thee for wise?
Go rather to the wretched wight
Pesistratus, and learn
If that he gilty be or no,
by whom thou may discearne
With equal eye, the likelyhoode
thereof, and may dispose
Thy deeds accordingly, which thought,
he presently arose,
And went in haste unto the mewe
where Pesistrate remaynde.
Whose person seen, the glad^^^ man
had thought that he (...) gainde
A happy pray, and then he said,
my friend, alas I wayle,
To see thy wretched case so much
in heart that tongue does fail
To utter what my meaning is:
but faithful friend disclose
Unto thy friend, if guilty thou
or innocent in those
So ^ainous faults be, yea, or no,
that to thy charge are laid?
To which so spoke, Pesistratus
again replying, said,
That as the mighty Jove of heaven
his recompense should make,
They sought no creatures death, nor harm,
nor once did undertake
Such minded mischief or pretense:
and then he opened all
The matter to Pecipater,
as how that each was thrall
To others love, long tract of time
before that it was known.
And by what lucklesse means, at last
their zealous love was shown.
As, how that unto Antropos
his secrets be discride,
By whom the letters first were sent,
and matters all were tried,
Yet to none other end at al,
but only touching love,
And nothing else was ever meant,
as well the letters prove.
And how the villain, privy to
the place of their resort,
His forged tale has now at last
confirmd in such a sort.
Because that in the pointed place
the lovers both were found,
Who meaned nothing, but to show
the fruits that did abound
From lovely stomackrs, as like case
of lovers does frequent:
This said, well quod Pecipater,
doubt not I shall prevent
His spitful grutch, so much as shall
apply to him the shame,
That he had thought to both of you,
by forged tale to frame.
And then bequeauyng Pesistrate
to Gods, he did depart
From thence at somewhat better ease,
and with more lighter heart
Than erst, when thither he approcht,
and then to prison hide
Whereas the woeful Catane
his doleful sister laid:
Of whom the matter asked, he
like answer had again,
As did agree to Pesistrats,
whereby he judged plain
The lovers to be innocent,
and that the feigned lie
Of villayne Antropos was false,
as he might well ^spye:
Whereon Catanea left, the wight
his sorrows fled away,
Did to his home repair, whereas
the longing man did stay
Til season such as poynted time
was present come, when as
The accused wights (their dungeons left)
to place of death should pass:
Where if they had no Champion pressed,
their lives for to defend,
They must prepare with hearts addressed
to take their latest end.
He then supposing to proceed
in their behalf to fight,
And with the villain Antropos,
to strain his ventured might,
And so content, til season that
to stay he lives in hope.
And when in space the tract of time
had compassed his scope,
And that the proclamation made
before, for poynted tide:
The time expyrde (as time in have
without respect does glyde)
The season is approcht, the accusde
are from the prisons brought
To foresaid place, whereas their deaths
of hangman must be wrought,
Except that Champion were addressed
their doubted lives to save,
By conquest got: who happy wights,
a valiant Champion have,
The which unknown to them appears,
in Sabels armor dight,
And settled well on barbed steed,
does offer for to fight
With villayne Antropos, whose guyle
had done extortious wrong,
He said, to Innocents, as he
would prove ere it were long:
And therewithal Sir Antropos
does enter into listes,
And with a Lions face he says*
what caytife here resists
The certain witness I do beat,
and saw with propre eyes?
To whom quoth Pecipater, I
it is who well espyes
Thy forged accusation false,
and shall perform the same
Upon thy carkas, spite of force,
to thy deserved shame,
Thou villain slave (quoth Antropos)
will thou in the defense
Of Traitors, venture to withstand
my rygorous sharp dispense?
And dare thou (replied he)
presume to meet my force
In quarrel false, as shall be provde*
upon thy caytife corse?
Yea said the one in spite of thee,
a quarrel just uphold
And Mauger thee (the other quoth)
supresse thy pride so bold:
Wherein the Heralds sownd dis^layd
the Coursers meet with spears
In settled r^stes, that trunc^lo^s burst,
the pieces pat their cares,
And then with glauering blades the blows
were dealt in such a wise,
That harness parde, the parings mount
aloft into the skies,
And sparkels beaten from their sides,
the Targets strong are torn,
The bars unbound, the helmets hard
by force asunder shorn,
The steely linkes unbeaten, bounst*
and thus the mortal fight,
Now quauining the accused hearts
now making stomach light,
The one he thinks of revenge,
on Pesistrate, whereby
With Serpents ^age in finished have
be lets the blows go fly:
To other striving for to save
his friends from foes dispight,
Like Lion fierce he yeeldes again
the blows with forcing might,
And thus the adversaries so,
had made their parties good,
That they had did the stained ground
with their diffused blood,
So long, til at the last the knights
thus straining manly strength,
Pecipater had pierst the sides
of Antropos at length,
And so courageously pursude
his foe with desperate blade,
That down fell Antropos to earth,
his fatal wound so made:
Whom Pecipater straight suppressed
with foot, and from the ground
With valiant stroke he made his head
from conquered corpse rebound.
Whereon with strained lofty voice,
the people movde such cries,
That through their hi^ conceived joys
they shakt I think the skies.
And now the lovers were so glad,
as though their lives renewd.
Their happy state with heavenly joys
and pleasures were indude,
But little deemed Pesistrate
the riddance of his pain
To come by death of Kenedox
his brother, that was slain.
Whereon they cravde to see the face
of viliant him, that so
Had saved their lives, and maintaind truth
and vanquished the foe.
And when his helmet laid aside
the lovers saw to be
Pecipater, and people viewd
and knew that it was he,
Oh how the people vaunst his fame,
and ioyed to see their Lord
So valiant Knight, and yielded praise
to him with one accord,
As though their voices would have raisde
the man from mortal case,
To hiest heavens for his desert,
amongst the Gods to place:
And so the lovers ioyd in heart,
requiting endless thanks
For his abundant courtesy,
and manly Martial prankes:
That it does far excel my power,
to paint in proper wise,
I therefore yield it to conceit
of each man to devise.
But when the turmoile ceased was,
and so the spite restrainde
Of raging foe, each hoping heart
by manly proof sustaind:
Pecipater the conquerous knight,
with comely courtly grace
Proceeds to Pesistrate, and does
with seemly arms embrace,
Whom he with gesture like requites
so courteously displayde,
That they that viewde the seemly sight,
were so in heart disma^de,
That tears by force distilling down
for joy from seers eyes:
Their fame of gentle gesture straight
amongst the thickest hyes:
And then his sister greeted like,
she likewise greets again,
That wondrous was it to behold,
how erst in desperate pain,
And now inioyes the altered time
they spend in happy plight,
With easy hearts, vnburdend bres^s,
and cause of al delight.
And thus when outward vttrance had
declarde each joyful mind,
Each man auoides the present place
unto his home assinde,
And conquerous knight, with Lovers does
proceed with courtly train,
Through T^rents streets, unto the place
whereas he should remain,
Who when he passed through the town
receiude such yielded fame,
As eke the Lovers for their truth
that to behold the same,
The tops of houses laden were,
and streets and stalles so fillde,
And windows decked with peoples prease
as nere or very sild,
Was like convent in Tarent town,
the people were so glad
Of constant Lovers saved life,
as ^ke because they had
Unto their Lord so vallant wight
as Pecipater was,
Who with the lovers and his train,
as still though stree^es they pass,
At last arrived at the place
of Pecipater, they
With joyful heart into his house
do presently convey
Themselves where pausde a little space
Pecipater does strain
To Pesistrate his voice, and thus
he said: thy grief my pain
It is Pesistratus, my friend,
and what thou do forbear,
I likewise feel, be it woe, be it wealth,
be it loss, anoy or fear.
Wherefore I crave thy curtesy,
to yield such like respect,
To my good will, as it regards
thy self, as one elect
Unto my self for faithful friend,
as partly has appearde
By venture lately for thy sake,
where rather I aspyrde
To dye with thee, than live deuoyde
of presence thine: wherefore
Know friend Pesistratus, I do
repute thy friendship more
Than succor of the mightiest Prince
or Mahomet alive
Whose hate were able to devise
my honor to depryue*
Since therefore that thou do suppose
it for thy happiest joy,
Thy greate^^ wealth and riddance best
from cause of al anoy,
For to retain Catanea
my sister unto thee,
My worthy friend Pesistratus,
I willingly agree,
unto the same, and what so else
of me thou shall request,
To grant thy suit at all assayes
I am as ready pressed:
And since thou know the spittful grutch
of Phetratus, beware
Thereof, and take advise least thou
incur a further care:
For I forcast and see it well,
that when that I deceast
My sister clayms my ruling room.
(her right) she shall suppressed
By currish caytife Phetratus,
then stoop to every yoke,
Whereto her careless uncle shall
the wretched wench provoke:
And thou shall likewise be so used,
as well I know, it shall
(If that thou do not well provide)
attain thy latest fall.
Hark therefore, oh my Pesistrate,
attend what I shall say,
If that thou live for to see
my death, without delay
Possess my place in present have,
as into thy due right
By Catane thy spouse, and hold
the same by Martial might:
For if the caytife Phetratus
have once his entry made
Before thou can attain thereto,
then know I, cruel blade
Shall work the death of both of you,
or else your utter spoil,
Whereby the pray shall be his own,
and yours shall be the foil.
Thus said Pecipater, and then
he ceast for to apply
His tongue to further speech, to whom
did Pesistrate reply,
With thanks his gentleness
requited, that his will
Should be with executed care
performed to the fill:
And after other course of talk,
the lovers did require
Their marriage shortly to be made,
unto the which desire
Pecipter consented straight,
whereon it was agreed
At pointed time (which shortly was)
that nuptials should with speed
Prepared be: and thus (their joys
increasing happy wights)
They did expect the wished time,
and spend in much delights
The joyful tide, til season that
for which the lovers stayde:
Which time they hoped well should now
no longer be delayde.
But woe, alas, to fortunes wyles,
whylest thus they fed on ioy^,
And were persuaded that they had
avoided al anoy,
Unhappy case (their cares renewd)
they suffer greater griefs,
Than all the former time, when state
was void of all reliefs.
For Phetratus accursed wight*
supposing what defame
Had grown to him through late abuse
unto his utter shame,
Began with rancour for to grutch
at wealth of their estate,
Since that himself was thr^lled so
to such abased state:
And began devise, ^ha^ if he could
a^^ure it to such pass,
That Pecipaters life were refte,
that then the nuptials was
Prevented, whereby he might then
as ruler work his list
Upon the lovers, when as none
his pleasure durst resist:
And thus the wretch supposing long,
perseuering in ^is thought,
At length devised by this means
to have his purpose wrought,
Which was to hyre some carlesse slave
with poison to beguile
Pecipater, and thinking thus,
when he had pausde a while
He calde to mind a certain wretch
that to him self retaynd,
Whose disposition fit he knew
to have these matters faynde:
To him in presence he discryde
the sum of al his mind,
Who soon agreed, and was content
to do what he assynde.
And to conclude, when thus they had
decreede on poynted tide,
The place, and by what secret means
the treason should be tryde,
The wicked servant did prepare
his medicine to frame,
The which so pampered, as he would,
when he had done the same,
In secret sort he did convey
himself unto the place
Whereas Pecipater did use
to sit in judgments case,
Where he impoysned the seat
with his infection strong,
And every other thing that did
unto the seat belong*
And then in have retired home:
and when the approached day
Was come, when Pecipaters use
was for to take his way
To forsayde place, whereas he did
the controversies cease
Of common wealth, and did maintain
^he course of public peace,
When as (alas) the worthy wight
had sit a while in seat,
He began in such a heated wise
in every part to swear,
That they that saw the valiant so
distempered, thought the route
Of people to have causde the same,
whereon they carried out
Their Lord into the open air,
and there the woeful wight
With deadly dis^greeing cold
straight struck, in open sight
Unto the heavens resinde his ghost,
his carkas left on ground,
Whereon was movde so great a noise
and such a piteous sound,
That well I deem the earth did shake
withal and rolling skies
W^^^ out of common course declinde
through such their mourneful cries:
The which when Phetratus had heard,
and knowing it to be
His purpose, wrought as though ye wretch
had only come to see
The cause of rumor, with a route
of thousand caytifes there,
He present was because of doubt
and his suspected fear
That people would accused him,
whereas with outward show
He so lamented, that none would
had judged him the foe
Of Pecipater, for he ragde
as though the wretched mad
Had bin for grief: when God did know
the cursed was as glad
Of his success in mischief wrought,
as he that had restrainde
With Martial fist, a vanquished host,
or sums of gold had gainde.
And then he so persuaded with
the people, that at rest
The body was conuayde from thence
with every thing addressed
For funerals in solemn wise:
and when the season cravde
That carcass should be laid in earth,
each thing was so behaude,
That least, the people did suspect
that Phetratus had wrought
The death of Pecipater, or
such thing he would have sought
Whereon they suffered him to rule,
til season that they might
More better know to whom the same
were incident by right.
But o^ the deadly pinching pains
and grievous grisly smarte
That bannished the lovers joys,
and gript them at the heart,
When woeful wretches they so saw
the increase of ceaseless care
Through worthy Pecipaters death,
which causde their mou^nful fare
That they incessantly bewaylde
with tears their fickle fate,
Well knowing that dispight would clean
suppress their quiet state,
As woeful wights to them it fell,
it did as they did fear:
For when the villayne Phetratus
did see, that for to bear
Authority he suffered was,
now minding to dispight
The lovers, seeing eke the time
so apt, that well he might
Endeavor his malicious wiles,
to work their utter thrall,
The wicked man to counsel does
the chief and Nobles call
Of his dominion, unto whom
in presence thus he said.
As I my Lords, so likewise you
I know are much dismayde
Through cause of Pecipaters death,
and since a great defame
It were to us, if slightly we
should ouerpasse the same,
I crave your courtesies to hear,
and hearing well to way
What thing as touching this, I am
disposed now to say:
You know how that the exile man
Pesistrate, has attainde
The love of Catane, whose will
would wisely be restrainde,
For how that Kenedox accusde
Pesistrate, it is plain
With reasons proof, that he should seek
through privy impoisned vain
My death: and note you well of this,
that he that has so sought
My death, whose death no whit at al
could pleasure him in ought
Would likewise seek the death of him
( Pecipater I mean)
Whose death would yield him title s^che
whereto the wretch might lean
Through Catane, for to possess
the room which he supplide,
Whereon I do presume, that he,
if it were thoroughly tried,
Were only woorker of his death,
through hope of foresaid gain:
I therefore do advise you, that
the wretch do not remain
In these our parts, but that exilde
he be, whereby we shall
Both Catane the dame reserve
from such a shameful fall
As she would get, if to the sla^e
the Lady matched were,
And eke avoid such rumors, as
the people would arer^.
And so he stint to speak: and they
with one accord agreed,
That Pesistrate, as he had said,
should be exild, with speed.
Whereon for Pesistratus they
did send by verlet straight,
To whom in presence they declard
the important cause of weight,
And there commanded him, that then
without a more delay,
As man exilde, from present place
he took his ready way
To foreign parts* informing eke
that if that he were found
Upon such day, in any place
of their Italian ground,
That he should dye: whereon the wight
began h^s journey made
With heavy heart in mourneful plight,
and presently does vade
Tarentum lest, as wandering wretch
into a Forest by,
Whereas he stays his lothed limbs
a while at ease to lie.
And when his musing brains had tossed
the loss of former joys,
And that his fancy fixly fed
upon a thousand toys,
At last, he pondering the cause
of cares that so befell
Unto his pay, his griping greefes
so grievously did quell
His hauty courage, that by force
his fainting limbs declinde,
That woeful lay, as though he were
a body reft of mind,
Until a space that season had
restord the course again
Which did revive his vital sense:
and then in greater pain
Than erst, the wretch bewaild, wherein
unto his dolors ^o^t,
Through painful fits, his faultring tongue
to speak was thus prouokt.
Alas what wretch does greater greefes
sustain, than I abide?
Or whose estate is more than mine
by fortunes spite defide?
Or whose excess of troubles, tear
his paineful pinched heart
So much, as my incessant cares
do work my deadly smarte?
In propre soil I sometime linde
a man of great renoune,
And now like slave in forreyne parts
I am suppressed down
And sometime have I in my joys
aduaunst my self with fame,
But now accurssed in my griefs
I live with exile name.
And woe to fortunes spiteful trade,
a joyful lover late
I was, and Lady had, but now
to vacabonds a mate:
Alas, alas, and will thou then
( Pesistratus) delay
To work thy death? will thou abide
to see an other day?
Thou have no cause of hope at al,
for thou have Lady left,
And thus exilde, art from her sight
for ever clean berest.
And likewise bannisht from thy joys:
for how can thou delight
In any thing, since void thou art
of Cataneas sight:
And can thou now forbear, to live
like servile slave again,
In toyling trade and skorned state?
and can thou so res^raine
Thy noble nature, when as erst
deuoyde of each anoy,
Thou did in ten times happy time
thy Ladies love enjoy?
No, no, thy loving heart may not
indeu^r for to pant
In vital sort, if that thou should
thy Ladies presence want.
Why therefore lingrest thou to stop
(quoth he) thy vital breath?
And therewithal the desperate man
did draw from secret sheath
His blade, wherewith the wretched men*
to make his woeful end,
But that the mighty God of heavens
did happy succoure send:
For by good chance, in Forest was
a sheephearde seeking there
I strayed sheep which he had lost,
who happened nere
Unto the place where Pesistrate
complaind, and secret he
Behind a thicket standing, did
the foresaid matter see:
Who ran to Pesistrate in have,
as so he was disposde
To take his death: and on his knees
the shepherd thus disclosde:
Oh seemly Knight, avoid this act,
and suffer not thy sist
To do thy death, let manly heart
thy forcing p^ngs resist:
Would thou condemn thy sprituall soul
for matters that be vain?
Or do thou deem that such thy death
would rid thee of thy pain?
No Lord, it would engender more
such matter as thou know,
Skorne therefore this, and do disdain
such matter as thou shewst:
And worthy Knight, let courage quail
the causes of thy care,
And time, no doubt, shall bring again
to thee thy joyful fare:
And though that thou exiled art
from present land, wherein
The cheifest comforts do consist,
yet let thy stomach win
Thy victory from doubts despair,
and do as I shall say,
Since that thou meanest not from hence
thy presence to convey,
But here would live, because thou may
by some adventured wise
Thy Ladies seemly face behold,
for fancies fears suffice,
Get shepheardes weeds of simple kind,
with tarboxe, dog and book,
And other things that ought to be
of shepherds undertook:
And so disguisd, thou may unknown
remain in quiet ease,
And understand thy Ladies state,
which stomach shall appease:
And I pretending openly
thy fellow mate, shall be
Thy humble servant to command,
in ought to pleasure thee*
Which said of shepherd, Pesistrate
did courteously requite
His good advise, and thanking Jove
for sudden such delight,
Agreed to all the shepherd had
declard, and did devise
In every point (as he had said)
himself so to disguise:
And to conclude, departed thence
to silly cottage by
Of shepherds, where the foresaid feat
they purposed to try.
And thus Pesistratus, become
a shepherd, and bedeckt
With such accordant robes as does
belong to shepherds seckt:
As hoode on head, and hook in hand,
and fastened dog by side,
And budget, tarbox, and such tools
of shepherds lusty pride:
In such his office for a space
I leave, and shall intend
To Catane my simple style,
who (woeful wench) does spend
The lot^some time in ceaseless mones,
^^mayling spiteful fate,
Wa^ so such sundry sorrows should
oppr^ss^ her hauty state:
And thinking that Pesistrate had
like faithless fayning Knight
Forsaken her, for doubted fear
of Phetratus despite,
Because she knew not, how exilde
He was through the consent
Of nobles (so in secret was
it kept of the convent)
Nor how he could not take his leave
of her, because in have
He was compeld to take his way:
The Lady does so wast
For pining grief, that wonder 'twas
to see how she was changde
From former hew, in vexed breast
her doleful dolors ^angde
In such a wise, and every day
the Lady would defame
The Knight in such reuyling sort
unto his caused blame,
In open presence unto such
as would to her attend,
That pity was it to behold,
how to a paineful end
She lives in earth: and ceaseless so
she spent the joyous days,
And cursed the Knight, and still complains
her griefs and never stays,
But many times in desperate mood.
endeavors with her knyfe
To splyt her tender heart in twain,
and reave her self of life.
And al these passions she sustaynde,
because she only thought
That Pesistrate had faynde, in all
that he before had wrought,
And ^ad bin fled, forsaking her,
whom woeful woman thus
In griefs I leave: and gladly shall
endeavor to discuss
The happy chance that now befell
unto their ceaseless joys,
And yielded wished ease to them,
avoiding al anoyes.
WHen long the Aganetians had
in Appollonia soil
Remaynde, without a governor
that should defend their foil,
They waying how that ought they had
of Pesistratus heard
(To be in Italy) agreed
to have it not defeard,
But that in present have there should
a posting verlet vade,
By whom in Italy there should
^e proclamation made,
In all the chief and famous towns,
contained in that land,
(As Well as in the farthest coasts,
so also near at hand)
That Kenedoxus was deposde
from Aganetians right,
And that the Aganetians will
was bent, that worthy Knight
Pesistratus, if so disposde
he were, should now possess
Their lands and Lordships, as the heir,
whose right they do confess
It is, and after such consent
the verlet, ouerpast
The surging seas, in happy time
arrived has at last
Italian parts: and there by chance
he traueld up the way,
Whereas Pesistrate keeping sheep
did silly shepherd stay*
Of whom the varlet, passing by,
demanded if he knew
A stranger, who Pesistratus
was hight, yea, God indew
The man with many more good gifts,
I know the Knight full well*
(Quod Pesistrate,) and in the town
of Tarent does he dwell.
And then the messenger declarde
the cause, why he was sent*
Into those parts, and told the whole
of foresaid his intent.
And after course of common talk,
the shepherd thankt, he hies
In have from thence, and Pesistrate
surmising, well espies
That Aganetians in distress
were over chargde with foes,
Whereon aduisde, in present have
the happy man he goes
To fellow shepherd and declares
the whole that happened had,
Who hearing of the lucky chance
was simple man much glad,
That such unlooked for success
allotted to the pay
Of Pesistrate, who shephearde left,
does take his ready way
In former costlye roabes yclad
(his shepherds weede^ res^^de
For shepherds use) to native soil,
whereas by prosperous wind
And lucky ship, in season short
arivde, he forward wends
To Appollonia, and from thence
a friendly letter sends
Unto the Aganetians, who
in solemn wise do meet
Their worthy kinsman, whow likewise
Pesistratus does greet
With trickling tears from eyes distild,
whereon the joyful knights
In happy state together spend
the time in all delights:
And then informing Pesistrate
of foes dispiteful rage,
The valiant knight does study much
their fierceness to assuage,
By whose advise and wise forecast
they gave their foes the foil,
And then did rest in quiet ease
and gouernde well their soil.
Of whom the R^^^r Pesistrate
assynde by one accord
Of Aganetians whole consent,
he lives a noble Lord,
And after space that his estate
was quietly disposde,
To Aganetians present all the valiant knight disclosde
With long oration, how his fates
in Italy befell,
And how in happy state a space
in Tarent he did dwell,
And how the spite of villain one
had wrought him such anoy,
And diverse times exylde his haps
from cause of chanced joy,
And then declaring of the Dame
Catanea, he shows,
Her noble state and hauty blood:
which Fama no more blows
Of duty than of her desert:
whose ^oyal love attainde
Of him he told, and how by spite
the same was still restrainde
From his effect, whereon he craude
the Aganetians aid
And patience, that an army might
to Tarent ^e conuayd,
Whereas the town besiegde, he would
obtaynt his proper right,
Which was the Lady, spite of foes
in open chalengd fight:
Or else with army overcome
by force their hauty pride,
And suffer not one foe alive
in Tarent to abide.
To which request, it was agreed
of Aganetians all,
With Pesistrate to live and die
to rise and likewise fall.
Then in have ^^^thing prepared,
and al things ready pressed,
With warlike naui^s they ariude
at Tarent, there do rest.
And after wise advise, agreed
to send to Tarent straight
A Herault dight, for to declare
the important cause of weight,
Who with his message will preparde,
did have, without delay,
To Phetratus, to whom approcht,
the Herault did display
That Pesistrate not little skornes
the fond disdaineful pride
And open wrong that he had done
to him, as should be tried
Upon his body, if he dare
in combat stand to prove
The same, as by his propre laws
and custom does behoue
He should: or else with armies force
he would the Tarents spoil
As never town before that time
received such a foil:
Which message done, it was replide
of Phetratus, that death
Should be his pay, and he with blade
would stop his propre breath
Before that once he, would deny
in combat for to fight
With Pesistrate: whereon he said
to Herault, that he might
Pesistrate tell, that he was mente
incombate for to try
Against the traitor, that he did
like faithless ^aytife lie,
To say (...) had open wrong
because he was restrainde
From Catane, for never he
her loyal love retainde:
And then, as shr^e the custom was,
with solemn oath he swear,
That (...) his quarrel was, and that
therein no cauels are.
And then the day appointed, when
the combat should be fought,
The Herault hyes to Pesistrate,
and tells how each thing wrought,
And how that Phetratus agreed,
in combat to mayntaine
His quarrel good, as he would prove,
(he say de) unto his pain:
For which expected time he stays.
But oh the great reliefes,
Catanea (happy) did conceive,
avoiding al her griefs,
When thus she saw the constancy
of Pesistrate, I deem
The woman thought her joys so great
as she should Gods seem.
And when the time appointed now
approached is, when knife
Of manly knight must yield him fame,
and end the deadly strife:
The Lady has her room in place
whereas the combat must
Be fought. Where preasing from the midst
of rout, the foes do thrust
Their martial bodies unto fight
in rattling armor, set
On barbed steed and then the book
of solemn swearing set,
The adversaries both do vow
this quarrel to be good,
And then the Knights with settled spear
do seek each others blood,
And meet with such a thundering noise
as thunder claps from sky,
Wherein each body borne from steed
with buckling sorst to fly,
They rise again, and with their blades
so diversely dispend
Their friendlesse blows, yt from their sides
they fyery sparkles send
With whizing blaze, in such a sort
as wondrous 'twas to sight,
To view the desperate dole of force,
and fierceness of their fight,
But at the last the courage of
sir Phetratus did quail,
The which espied of Pesistrate
so faintly for to fail,
Renewde with sight of Ladies grace
his strength did so abound,
That with a valliant stroke from corpse
he drove his head to ground.
And then the people movde their shootes,
and caps did cut the air,
And happy man Pesistrate had
obtainde his Lady fair,
Whose mutual joys did so excel,
as far it does exceed,
Of any heart to be comprisde:
and through his martial deed,
He wan the peoples favor so,
that every wights consent,
That he should reign in Tarent town
was very well content:
Whereby adua^^st to hauty fame,
the Lovers both at rest,
The right of marriage had) inioyd^
their loves, and (cares suppressed)
Did spend their days in ceaseless joys,
and died in quiet peace:
Whose like success in loyal love
the mighty Jove increacee.
FINIS.
