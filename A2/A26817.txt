THE PREFACE.
Reader,
THis small Treatise now put into thy Hand, has no less of Authority and Use,
than it has of Antiquity. It contains the Ancient Charter of King Henry the
Third, concerning the Ordinance of Romney-Marsh, and the Laws and Customs made
by the Learned Justice Henry de Bathe, in the Two and fortieth year of the
Reign of the said Henry the Third, for the Reparation of the Sea-Banks, and for
the preservation of the said Marsh from Inundations; and is since become the
Pattern or Law for all other Sea-Borders, and great Marshes and Fenns. I need
not use much Art to recommend to the Ingenuous Reader, the Authority and
Usefulness of this Book; It being the Grant of a Wise Prince, and the Law and
Ordinance Framed and Contrived by a Learned Sage in the Laws of this Realm, and
continues to this day the Standard from whence all England receives Light and
Direction, as will appear by those following Examples.

The Act of 6 H. 6. cap. 5. in the 6 H. 6. cap. 5.
very Form of the Commission of Sewers, it is there said, That the
Commissioners shall make and ordain necessary and convenient Statutes and
Ordinances for the Defense and Safety of the Sea-Banks and Marshes, and the
parts adjoining according to the Laws and Customs of ROMNEY-MARSH, and to hear
and determine according to the Law and Custom of our Realm of England, and the
Custom of ROMNEY-MARSH, all and singular the Premises, etc. The Famous English
Lawyer Sir Edward Cook, 4 Inst. cap. 62. fo. 276.
in the Fourth Part of his Institutes of the Laws of England, has these words,
ROMNEY-MARSH in the County of Kent containing 24000 Acres, is at this day, and
long time has been, Governed by certain Ancient and Equal Laws of Sewers,
made by the Venerable Justice Henry de Bathe, in the Reign of King HENRY the
Third, from which Laws, not only other Parts in Kent, but all ENGLAND receive
LIGHT AND DIRECTION. For Example, in the General Act of 23 H. 8. cap. 23 H. 8.
cap. 5.
5. concerning Sewers in Section 3. there is a Clause which gives power to the
Commissioners to make Statutes, Ordinances and Provisions, etc. necessary and
behoofeful after the Laws and Customs of ROMNEY-MARSH in the County of Kent, or
otherwise by any ways and means, etc. The Learned Sergeant Callis in his
Reading Callis his Readings.
upon the Statute of 23 H. 8. cap. 5. of Sewers, makes very great use of, and
frequently quotes the Charter of Romney-Marsh, as the Basis on which that
Statute was founded, as you find by perusing that Reading. By all which it will
evidently appear, of what Use and Esteem the Law and Customs of Romney-Marsh
have been held in, in time past, by the most Eminent Prosessors of the Law. Nor
is it of any less Use and Esteem at this day, as may be seen by the Statute of
15 Car. 15 Car. 2. cap. 2. Sect. 5.
2. cap. 2. made for the draining the great Level of the Fenns, called
Bedford-Level, in Section the fifth, where there is a Clause, That the
Governors, Bailiffs, and Conservators of Bedford-Level, shall have further
power (as well for the Maintenance of the said GREAT LEVEL, as for laying and
levying of Taxes) to use and exercise within the said Great Level, such and the
like Laws and Customs; and constitute and appoint such and the like Officers,
from time to time, as are or lawfully may be used in ROMNEY-MARSH in the County
of Kent. Now Reader, having given thee the Opinion of the Learned upon this
Treatise it self: I shall let the Reader know the Reasons that induced the
Publisher to reprint it: (1.) The General Benefit and Advantage that all may
Reap thereby. Secondly, The particular Solicitation of some Friends, who are
Interested in this, or some other Marshes subject to these Laws and Customs,
and having long Endeavored to purchase this small Tract, could not obtain it
under 6 s price, its scarceness and usefulness having enhanced its price so far
beyond its bulk; for which Reasons the Reprinting it was deemed of General
Acceptance and Advantage; which that it may so prove, is the Publishers great
Design and Aim.

Nullus Vicecomes vel aliquis Balliorum suorum cum districtionibus illis se
intromittant.

evitandum, in aliquo se intromittant. Quicunque enim de consideratione ipsarum
districtionum, ad nos querelam detulerit, nos ei in Curia nostra justitiam
fieri faciemus, and illam justitiam nobis vel Mandato nostro speciali,

inter viginti quatuor Juratores and homines de Marisco de Romenal, de
reparatione Walliarum and Watergagiorum, ibidem existentium apud Romenal, die
Sabbati proxime post Nativitatem beatae Mariae Virginis, Anno regni Regis
Henrici praedicti quadragesimo secundo, associatis sibi Nicholao de Handlo, and

Henric^ de Bathonia, quod cum judicia fieri debeant per viginti quatuor
legales homines de Marisco de Romenal, ad districtiones faciendas super omnes
illos, qui terras, and tenementa habent in praedicto Marisco, ad reparandum

Marisci, districtiones praedictas fieri facerent, ita quod debite fierent,
secundum portiones majores and minores, quas homines habent in eodem Marisco,
and secundum quod quidam ad hoc obligantur vel tenentur. Ita quod nullus
Vicecomes Domini Regis Kanciae, vel aliquis Ballivorum suorum, de
districtionibus illis per considerationem praedictorum viginti quatuor
Juratorum factis propter periculum praedictum evitandum, in aliquo se
intromittant. Sed si quis de consideratione praedictarum districtionum Callis

se injuste gravatum sentiret, and inde conqueri vellet, ad ipsum Dominum
Regem, querelem suam deferret, and ipse ei in Curia sua Justitiam fieri
faceret, and illam Justitiam, ipsi Domino Regi vel Mandato suo speciali
specialiter reservasset, iidem Juratores propter resistentiam hominum Marisci
dictas districtiones facere nequeant.
viginti quatuor Juratores, propter considerationem and resistentiam quorundam
hominum de praedicto Marisco, qui ad reparationem dictarum Walliarum and
Watergagiorum, secundum quantitatem terrarum and tenementorum quae habent in
eodem Marisco tenentur, dictas districtiones facere nequeant, unde Walliae
illae and Watergagiae irreparatae existunt per quod inundationes Maris and
aliarum aquarum de dicto Rex constituit Henricum de Bathonio ad audiend' and
(...)' contentiones inter praedict^s (...). Jurat' and (...).
Marisco magnum occupant spatium, ad ipsius Domini Regis and hominum dicti
Marisci inestimabile dispendium. Ipse Dominus Rex, dictum Henricum constituit,
Justiciarium suum, ad audiendum and terminandum contentiones ortas de
reparatione praedicta, inter praedictos viginti quatuor Juratos, and homines
praedicti Marisci. Et providendum securitati and defensioni praedicti Marisci,
contra Maris and aliarum aquarum inundationem and periculum, per reparationem
praedictarum Walliarum and Watergagiorum faciendam, per eos qui ad reparationem
illam, secundum quantitatem Terrarum and Tenementorum quae habent in eodem
Marisco tenentur, and secundum quod quidam ad hoc, alias obgligantur and
tenentur. Mandans eidem Henrico, dictus Dominus Rex, quod ad diem and locum
quos ad hoc duxerit providendum esset in partibus illis, ad praedicta faciendum
sicut praedictum est: Et quod ipse quid inde fecerit, ipsi Domino Regi in
scriptis, distinct and aperte scire faceret, ut idem Dominus Rex ea irrotulari
facere posset, etc.

Per quod Mandatum, idem Henricus die supradicto, existens apud Romenal
associatis sibi praedicto Nicholao de Handlo, and Aulredo de Dene, and
assistente eidem Vicecomite Kanciae, qui per praeceptum Domini Regis ad diem
illum, coram illo Ordinatio Henrici de Bathonia Justiciarij Domini Regis H. 3.

quod dictae contentiones terminari, and dicta provisio melior fieri possunt,
nullo homine de praedicto Marisco tunc contradicente; dictus HENRICUS
communitatis praedicti Marisci similiter ibidem tunc existentis, interveniente
Consilio ordinavit in forma subscripta: videlicet, quod per totam Quod 12.
homines Eligantur per totam Communitatem, viz. 6. de Food' Archiepiscopi, et 6.
de Baronia qui mensurabunt Wallias et Terras quae infradictum Mariscum periculo
subjacent. Callis Lect. fol. 158.
communitatem dicti Marisci eligantur duodecim legales homines, videlicet, sex
de feodo Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis, and sex de Baronia qui jurati mensurabunt
Wallias novas and antiquas, and illas qui de novo construi oporteat. Et debet
fieri eadem mensuratio per unam and eandem perticam, scilicet, viginti pedum.
Et postea praedicti Jurati per eorum Sacramentum similiter per eandem perticam
mensurabunt, per Acras omnes Terras and Tenementa quae infra dictum Mariscum
periculo subjacent. Quibus mensurationibus factis, viginti quatuor per
communicatem prius electi and jurati, habito respectu ad quantitatem Walliarum,
Terrarum and Tenementorum, quae periculo subjacent, per eorum Sacramentum
ordinabunt, quantum ad praedictarum Walliarum sustentationem and reparationem
faciendam and sustinendam, ad quemlibet pertineat: Ita quod pro portione
Acrarum Terrarum Jarat' proportione Acrarum Terrarum periculo singulis
assignetur sua portio perticarum per loca certa.
periculo subjacentium singulis assignetur sua portio perticarum, and praedicta
assignatio fiat per loca certa. Ita ut sciatur ubi and per quae loca, ad
quantum singuli defendere teneantur. Et cum necessitas evenerit cujus occasion
oporteat periculo and impetu Maris obviare vel resistere per reparationem
Walliarum praedictarum, convenire debent viginti quatuor Jurati, ad videndum
per quae loca praedicta emineat necessitas, and cui and quibus praedicta loca
assignata fuerint defendenda, and ipsum terminum praedicta loca oporteat
reparare. Qui quidem communis Ballivus illis quibus praedicta loca Ballivus

assignata fuerint defendenda, scire faciet, quod loca illa defendent, and
reparare faciant, infra terminum a praedictis viginti quatuor Juratoribus,

Ballivus communis de suo proprio, tales reparationes fieri faciet, per visum
viginti quatuor Juratorum. Et idem negligens eidem Ballivo duplum reddere Si
ipsi ad hoc facere neglexerint Ballivum tales reparationes facere. Et idem
negligens Ballivo duplum reddere et distringi possit per Terras suas.
teneatur pro custa apposito circa hujusmodi reparationes, quod duplum
reservetur ad utilitatem dictarum reparationum. Et super hoc hujus negligens
distringi possit per Terras suas, infra dictum Mariscum. Et si aliquae
perticulae Terrarum teneantur in communi, a participibus, ita quod ad quemlibet
participem, pro portione partis suae assignari non possit, locus certus,
scilicet, integra vel medica pertica, pro parvitate dictae perticulae, tunc per
Sacramentum viginti quatuor Juratorum ordinabitur and videbitur De Terris

distringere duplum super participes.

in manu sua tenent, illam tenebunt, donec ipse negligens appositi custos circa
praedictam defensionem, partem suam contingentem, per visum viginti quatuor
Juratorum, duplum solverit, ad utilitatem praedictarum reparationum, sicut
dictum est. Et si omnes hujus participes circa praedicta negligentes
extiterint, tunc praedictus communis Ballivus totam defensionem praedictam
faciet de suo proprio, and praedictos participes postea ad duplum custi circa
hujusmodi defensionem, per visum viginti quatuor Juratorum appositi distringat,
sicut praedictum, salvo capitalibus Dominis feodi in praedicto Marisco jure suo
quod habeant Salvo Capital' Dominis feodi suo jure.
versus tenentes suos de hujus defensione, secundum Feoffamenta sua; Et quod
omnes Terrae in Marisco custodiantur contra Maris impetum and aquarum dulcium

viginti quatuor Juratorum, ad minus perdendum and ad plus salvandum sicut
antiquitas utebatur. Salvo etiam tenore Chartae Domini Regis Communitati dicti
Marisci concessae, ne aliquis Vicecomes Kanciae nec Ballivus suus aut Salvo
Communitati dicti Marisci tenore Chartae Domini Regis eisdem concessae.
minister aliquis infra dictum Mariscum aliquam faciat districtionem, occasion
aliquorum dictorum Articulorum, sicut in praedicta Carta continetur; Quae
quidem Carta ista non obstante Ordinatione in suo perpetuo robore perseveret,
etc.

Rex Vicecomiti Kanciae Salutem. Cum nuper assignaverimus dilectum and fidelem
(...) Domini Regis vicecomite Kanciae quod de distructionibus praedictis in
nullo se intro^^^tat.
nostrum Henricum de Bathonia ad audiendum and terminandum contentiones habitas
inter 24. legales homines de Marisco de Romenal, per quorum considerationem
reparationes Walliarum and Watergagiorum ejusdem Marisci contra Maris impetum,
and periculum aliarum aquarum ibidem inundantium fieri debent, and alias Terras
and Tenementa in eodem Marisco habentes, qui Wallias and Watergagias illas
reparare debent and solebant. Et idem Henricus ad parts illas personaliter
decedens, ordinaverit quod secundum considerationem praedictorum viginti
quatuor Juratorum districtiones fierent pro reparatione Walliarum and
Watergagiorum praedictarum. Ita quod nullus Vicecomes aut alius Ballivus noster
se intromittent de districtionibus praedictis, sicut in Rotulis Cancellariae
nostrae, ordinationem illam exprimentibus continetur. Tu nichilominus
districtiones illas propter hoc factum, per viginti quatuor Juratores in
praejudicium considerationis eorundem relaxasti. Et quia si quis se gravatum
sentiat, ex consideratione praedicta pro qua conqueri voluerit, ad nos venire
debet remedium petiturus. Tibi praecipimus, quod de districtionibus praedictis
in nullo te intromittas, sed eas viginti quatuor Juratoribus and eorum Ballivo
ad hoc deputato, districtiones illas returnari facias. Ne iteratus clamor ad
nos inde perveniat, pro quo ad te graviter capere debeamus. Test meipso apud
Westmonasterium vicesimo die Aprilis, Anno Regni nostri quadragesimo tertio,
per Henricum de Bathonia, etc.

Tunc sequitur numerus omnium Acrarum infra dictum Mariscum sicut reperitur per
mensuram factam, Anno Regni Regis Henrici quadragesimo secundo, and etiam
agistatio tam in Magna Wallia de Apuldre, quam in parva Wallia, ad quantitatem
Terrarum Tenementum infra, etc.

praedictas, etc. ipsius Godefridae just and in Pace Domini Regis, quia dicit
quod praedictus Godefridus habet Terras, etc. in Marisco de Romeney ubi omnes
tenentes Terras and Tenementa in eodem Marisco secundum quantitatem Terrae suae
debent facere Wallias and Watergagias contra Mare, propter inundationes
Aquarum, ac viginti quatuor homines legales de dicto Marisco electi per
communitatem dicti Marisci, and Juratores super Tenentes in eodem Marisco
facere debent districtiones, secundum quantitatem tenementorum suorum cum
necesse fuerit, ad praedictas Wallias and Watergagias faciendum and reparandum.
Qui quidem Jurati in eodem Marisco, prout moris est, eo quod omnes ad hoc
vacare non potuere, elegerunt praedictum Hamonem, ad faciendum praedictas
districtiones, and ipsum fecerunt Ballivum suum ad hoc faciendum, and istam
libertatem habent per antiquam consuetudinem ejusdem Marisci, and per cartam
Domini Regis quam nunc proferunt in hec verba. Henricus Dei gratia, etc. Unde
dicit, quod ratione defectus ipsius Godefridi, just fecit super ipsum
praedictam districtionem ad praedictas Wallias and Watergagias reparandas, de
quibus in Wallia de Apuldre ei assignatae sunt ad portionem suam, per
praedictos Juratos, tres perticatae and dimidium ad minus ad Custum suum
reparandum, and secundum inundationem. Aquarum plus, si necesse fuerit per loca
diversa, and quod super ^ipsum majorem districtionem nisi fecerint ponunt se
super Patriam, etc. Dicunt tamen, quod ceperunt super quendam A. B. sex
Boviculos, qui fuit firmatius ipsius Godefridi, and december Agnos super I. N.
Tenentes ipsius Godefridi, ratione defectuum praedictarum Walliarum and
Watergagiarum, propter quod post modum ipsi satisfecerunt and rehabuerunt
averia sua. Quaesitis pro quanto fecit primam districtionem and pro quanto
secundam dicunt quod primus defectus ipsius Godefridi estimabatur ad quatuor
Marcas, and secundus defectus ad quadraginta octo Solidos. Et praedictus
Godefridus dicit, quod Replicatio (...).
ipse Tenet Tenementa sua in Marisco praedicto, ex dono and concessione Domini
Henrici quondam Regis Angliae, avi Domini Regis Henrici nunc, quae idem Dominus
Henricus ded't cuidam Willielmo filio Balderi Antecessori ipsius Godefridi,
cujus haeres, etc. per quam concessionem antecessores sui, and ipse postea
sempertenuit Tenementa sua in praedicto marisco, adeo libere and quiet sicut
praedictus Balderus ea prius tenuit. Et been dicunt quod nec ab Antecessoribus
suis, nec ab ipso nunquam fuit quaesita hujusmodi consuetudo, ad dictas Wallias
and Watergagias reparandas, nisi jam quintis Annis elapsis, postquam praedictus
Hamo factus fuit Ballivus, ad praedictas Wallias and Watergagias custodiendas,
nec unquam aliquo tempore ea fecerunt. Et profert cartam ipsius Henrici Regis
in hec verba. Henricus Dei Gratia Rex Angliae, etc. Archiepiscopo
Cantuariensis, etc. Et dicit quod praedictum Feoffamentum tenuere Antecessores
sui, praedicta Tenementa adeo libere, quod nunquam fecerunt nec reparaverunt
Wallias nec Watergagias nec ipse, postquam Terras illas tenuit, nec
antecessores sui districti fuerunt, quousque jam quinque Annis elapsis vel sex,
quod praedictus Hamo and alii ceperunt averia sua. Et desicut ipsi cognoscunt
quod fecerunt super ipsum, praedictam districtionem pro defectu reparationis
praedictarum Walliarum and Watergagiarum, quas nec ipse nec Antecessores sui,
fecerunt nec unquam facere consueverunt, petit judicium de eorum recognitione.
Et praedictus Hamo and alii dicunt, Rejungen' Defendentum.
quod aliquo tempore fuit contentio inter Tenentes in praedicto marisco super
reparatione praedictarum Walliarum and Watergagiarum, ita quod placitum motum
fuit inde in Comitatu coram Vicecomite, propter quod viginti quatuor Jurati
sentientes se gravatos venerunt ad Curiam Domini Regis and conquesti fuerunt de
Vicecomite asserentes, quod hujusmodi placitum non pertinuit ad Vicecomitem
tenendum, ita quod per Consilium Domini Regis provisum fuit, quod ibidem
mitterentur Justiciarii Domini Regis, ad ordinandum and disponendum quod justum
esset de hujus contentionibus. Ordinatio Henrici de Bathonia placitata.
Ita quod Henricus de Bathonia ibidem missus fuit, and omnes Tenentes dicti
Marisci habuerunt Summonitionem quadraginta dierum sicut fuisset in itinere
Justiciarioriis. Et ipse Praedictus Henricus, visis praedictis Walliis and
Watergagiis, per assensum and voluntatem totius communitatis praedicti Marisci
ordinant, quod Archiepiscopi, Episcopi, Abbates, Priores, Comites, Barons, and
omnes Tenentes in eodem Marisco contribuerunt, secundum quantitatem Tenementi
sui, ad praedictas Wallias and Watergagias reficiendas, unde sicut praedictus
Godfridus vult defendi per praedictas Wallias and Watergagias, petit quod
contribuat ad easdem reparandas sicut coram praedicto Justiciario fuit
ordinatum. Et quod talis sit ordinatio, sicut praedictum, ponit se super
Recordum Rorulorum praedicti Henrici de Bathonia. Dicit etiam quod necesse est

per praedictas Wallias esset defensa, tota Terra sua esset superundata and

fuisset per praedictum Surrejungen' quer'. Quod ille nunquam eidem Ordinationi
Consentit nec Summonitus fuit. Def' respond' quod ipse quer habuit Communem
Summonitionem sicut reliqui Marisci habuerunt.
Henricum ipse Godefridus nunquam eidem Ordinationi consensit, nec summonitus
fuit, nec vocatus venire coram ipso ad ipsam Ordinationem faciendam; dicit
etiam quod nec ante ipsam Ordinationem nec post, ipse nec Antecessores ejus,
nuper fecerunt hujusmodi contributionem, sed semper tenuerunt Terram suam
quietam ab omnimoda exactione, secundum Tenorem praedictae Cartae Henrici Regis
avi Regis nunc, quousque jam duobus Annis elapsis, praedicti Hamo and alii
ceperunt averia sua, unde petit judicium si praedictus debeat ei nocere in hac
part. Et praedicti Hamo and alii dicunt quod ipse habuit Communem
Summonitionem quadraginta dierum, sicut tota Communitas praedicti Marisci, quam
ipse ignorare non debuit, unde dicit quod licet ibidem nollet venire, sicut
debet cum vicinis suis, non debet esse quietus propter hoc a praedicta
Contributione, ad praedictas Wallias reparandas, desicut communis utilitas est
omnium Tenentium in dicto Marisco, quod tam Terra ipsius quam Terra aliorum
Tenentium defendatur per praedictas Wallas and Watergagias, unde petit
Judicium, dicit etiam quod post praedictam Ordinationem dederunt praedictus
Godfridus and homines sui unam Marcam ad Wallias and Watergagias praedictas
reparandas, antequam idem Hamo esset Ballivus, and quod ita sit paratus est
verificare, etc. Et Godefridus dicit quod tenet se ad praedictam Cartam Domini
Regis and ad libertatem suam quam ipse and antecessores sui usi sunt, contra
quas nulla ordinatio per praedictum Henricum facta, potest nec debet ei nocere,
and been defendit, quod nec ipse nec aliquis per ipsum, aliquid unquam ante

Dominus Rex mandavit dilectis and fidelibus suis, Johannis de Lovetot, and
Henrico de Apuldrefeld, breve suum, in haec verba, Edwardus Dei gratia Rex
Angliae, Dominus Hiberniae, and Dux Aquitaniae, dilectis and fidelibus suis,
Johanni de Lovetot, and Henrico de Apuldrefeld salutem. Sciatis quod cum nos
ratione dignitatis regiae, and per Juramentum abstricti sumus, ad providendum
salvationi regni nostri, circumquaque assignavimus, vos ad supervidendum
Wallias and fossata per costeram maris and partium adjacentium in comitatu
Kanciae, per maris intemperiem diversimode diruta, ad inquirendum per quorum
defecta hujus damnum contigit ibidem, and de omnibus illis qui Terras and
Tenementa tenent in partibus illis, and defensionem and salvationem habent
qualitercunque, vel habere possunt per hujus Wallias and fossatas, and ad eos
pro quantitate terrae and tenementorum suorum, sive per numerum Acrarum terrae,
sive per carucatas pro rata portione tenurae suae distringendi una cum Ballivis
libertatum and aliorum de partibus illis ad ea in locis necessariis reparandum,
quotiens and ubi necesse fuerit, ita quod aliqui tenentes Terras seu Tenementa
hujus vel alterius fuerit conditionis, status seu dignitatis, qui
qualitercunque defensionem habeant per hujus Wallias and fossatas, sive fuerit
infra libertatem, sive extra nullatenus parcatur in hac part. Et ideo vobis
Mandamus quod in executionem istius negotii, ita fideliter and discrete vos
habeatis, quod tam homines manentes in locis praedictis, quam Terrae eorundem
salventur contra similia pericula, and casualiter pejora nulla consimiliter
favorabiliter introducte resistente. Et vos super hiis quae in hac part
feceritis and ordinaveritis, sub vestris sigillis and sigillis Juratorum tam
militum, quam aliorum proborum and legalium hominum, distinct and aperte
reddetis certiores. Mandavimus enim Vicecomiti nostro comitatus praedicti, quod
ad certos dies and loca quos eis scire faceret, coram vobis venire faceret tot
and tales probos and legales homines de Balliva sua, per quos rei veritas
melius sciri poterit and inquiri in praemissis, etc. In cujus rei testimonium,
etc. Test Edmundo Comite Cornubiae Constabulario nostro, apud Westmonasterium
quinto decimo die Novembris, anno regni nostro sextodecimo.

Per quod quidem mandatum, praeceptum fuit Vicecomiti quod venire faceret coram
praefatis Justiciariis hic ad hunc diem, Mandatum vicecomiti.
viginti quatuor Juratores de Marisco de Romenal, and omnes Dominos Walliarum
ejusdem Marisci, and tot and tales probos and legales homines de singulis
terris Maritimis in Balliva sua, per quos rei veritas in praemissis, melius
sciri poterit and inquiri, ad faciendum ulterius id quod in praemissis fuerit
ordinandum, qui modo venerunt. Et praedicti viginti quatuor Juratores de
Marisco praedicto una cum communitate ejusdem Marisci dixerunt, quod Juratores
placitant Cartam H. 8. eisdem concess^m.
Dominus Henricus Rex pater Regis nunc per Cartam suam concessit eis quasdam
libertates in terris suis de Marisco praedicto and petierunt quod libertates
suae praedictae sibi salventur, and quod nihil attemptetur vel ordinetur in
praejudicium libertatum suarum praedictarum. Et profert Cartam Domini Henrici
praedicti in haec verba. Henricus Dei Gratia, etc. Dixerunt etiam quod Dominus
Rex pater Domini Regis nunc Anno regni sui quinquagesimo secundo ratione
cujusdam dissentionis subortae inter diversos homines Marisci supradicti
occasion Williarum and Watergagiorum Placitant etiam Ordinationem Henrici de
Bathonia praed.
ibidem reparandorum misit Henricum de Bathonia Justiciarium suum ad parts
illas, ad audiendum and terminandum contentiones ortas de reparatione praedicta
inter viginti quatuor Juratores and homines praedicti Marisci and ad
providendum securitati and defensioni ejusdem Marisci, contra Maris and aliarum
aquarum inundationem and periculum per reparationem praedictarum Walliarum and
Watergagiarum faciendam per eos qui per reparationem illam secundum quanitatem
Terrarum and Tenementorum suorum quae habent in eodem Marisco tenentur. Unde
dicunt quod praefatus Henricus de Bathonia Auctoritate mandati Domini HENRICI
Regis praedicti ordinavit and statuit eis ibidem certam Legem and Ordinationem
per quas Mariscus ille hucusque custoditur and salvatur, unde petierunt quod
per ordinationem and Legem illam possint imposterum deduci and defendi sicut
hactenus consueverunt. Et super hoc protulerunt praedictam ordinationem ipsius
Henrici de Bathonia sub Sigillo Domini Regis in haec verba Coram Henrico de
Bathonia, etc. ut supra, etc.

Et quia ordinatio praedicti Henrici statim Confirmatio Ordinationis Henrici de
Bathonia.
videtur concordans equitati and hucusque fuit approbata, praeceptum est and
statutum quod ordinatio illa in omnibus observetur absque diminutione: additio
tamen quod quia in ordinatione praedicta nihil fuit expressum de electione
communis Ballivi Domini Regis in Marisco praedicto, Ad quam modus Eligendi
Communis Ballivi additur.
quomodo est per quos electio illa fieri debeat, concordatum est, quod de
caetero cedente vel decedente communi Ballivo praedicti Marisci locus ipsius
alius eligatur, qui resideat et terras habeat in praedicto Marisco. Et fiat
electio illa de caetero per communem assensum duarum villarum ejusdem Marisci,
vel per Attornatos suos, and ubi major pars numero concenserit, stabitur eorum
electioni, quia sic hactenus ibi fieri consuevit. De duplo est sumptuum
appositorum de reparatione defectuum praedicti Marisci levand. in poenam
negligentium defectus ipsos contingentes reparare concordatum est, quod duplum
illud levetur sicut Quomodo duplum levetur and approprietur.
priori ordinatione fuerat statutum, and quod duplum illud in communem
utilitatem reparationis dicti Marisci revertatur and ad usus Ballivi ejusdem
Marisci de caetero non observetur. Et quia in praedicto Marisco diversae
Walliae and Watergiae quarum reparationem and sustentationem communitas ejusdem
Marisci non contribuit, nisi tantum illi qui dictis Walliis and Watergagiis
Terras habent continguas and proximas, and quidam per oppressiones Dominorum
dicti Marisci quandoque tantum solverint, ad reparationem and sustentationem
earundem pro quadraginta Acris quantum, alii pro quinquaginta Acris quod magis
fuerat, contra Legem Marisci and Ordinationem praedicti Henrici de Bathonia;
concordatum est, and ordinatum, quod nulla consuetudine a quocunque prius
introducta resistente omnes and singuli Terrae and Tenementa Quod singuli
terras and tenementa habenres quae periculo maris subjacent aut salvationem
habent pro eadem de caetero Distringantur.
ibidem habentes quae periculo Maris subjacent ibidem and salvationem habent
pro eadem de caetero distringantur ad Wallias and Watergagias illas reparandas
and sustinendas. Ita quod singuli contribuanr equaliter juxta numerum Acrarum
quas habent ibidem, ita quod nulli parcatur, cujuscunque fuerit status and
conditionis, qui per easdem salvationem habent and defensionem. Et quia in
eodem Marisco de Romenal ultra cursum aquae portus illius tendentem de Suergate
versus Romenhale ex Occidentali part illius portus usque comitatum Sussex,
nulla fuit prius certa Lex Marisci statuta nec usitata, nisi ad voluntatem
Terras habentium in eodem, per quod diversa pericula and damna intolerabilia
per Maris inundationem contingerant ut de caetero talibus periculis obvietur,
and communi utilitate prospiciatur concordatum est and conjunctim ordinatum,
quod in Marisco Ordinatum est quod in Marisco ultra portum usque Sussex
Juratores statuantur Electi pro securitate partium illarum pro ut continetur in
Ordinatione praedicti Henrici de Bathonia. Calli. Lect. 39.
ultra portum praedictum versus Sussex statuantur Juratores per communitatem
electi qui pro securitate partium illarum ad hoc jurati, habito respectu ad
numerum acrarum quae dicto periculo subjacent, and ad quantitatem Walliarum and
Watergagiorum ibidem reparandorum and sustinendorum per eorum Sacramentum
considerabunt and ordinabunt quantum necesse sit ad reparationem and
sustentationem illarum, Ita quod unusquisque pro portione acrarum dicto
periculo subjacentium eque contribuat, ad sustentationem earundem. Ita quod
juxta portionem acrarum suarum and valorem earundem singulis assignetur in
Walliis and Watergagiis praedictis portio sua perticarum sustinenda prout
continetur before in ordinatione praedicti Henrici de Bathonia. Et insuper
quia hactenus in partibus illis ultra portum praedictum versus Sussex nullus
fuerat communis Ballivus constitutus, qui de periculis ibidem contingentibus
provideret and caveret pro communi utilitate partium illarum, and ne de caetero
consimilia pericula ibidem inveniantur, Ordinatum est, quod de Quod de caetero
eligatur Ballivus in Mariscis ultra cursum (...) quae versus Suffex.

faciendas, and districtiones ob hoc faciendas fieri and duplum a negligentibus,

patris Simonis Archiepiscopi Cantuariensis and aliorum Terras infra praecinctum
Marisci de Roman tenentium accepimus quod cum omnes Terrae illae juxta
costeram maritimam jaceant, and absque continua custodia Walliarum Gutterarum
and Fossatorum and aliarum defensionum tam pro exclusione aquae maritimae quam
pro evacuatione aquarum dulcium, ibidem factarum nequeant ullo modo defendi and
salvari, per quod tempore Domini Henrici quondam Regis Angliae proavi nostri
per Henricum de Bathonia and socios suos Justiciarios ejusdem proavi nostri ad
dictas Wallias Fossata and Gutteras, ac defensionem inde supervidendas, and

THE CHARTER OF HENRY KING of ENGLAND, Concerning the Ordinance of Romney-Marsh.
HENRY by the Grace of God, The Charter of King Henry the Third.
King of England, Lord of Ireland, Duke of Normandy, and Earl of Andeg. To all
his Bailiffs and faithful Subjects, to whom these present Letters shall come,
Greeting. Because by four and twenty lawful men of Romney-Marsh (time out of
mind) hereunto chosen and sworn, Distresses ought to be made upon all those
which have Lands and Tenements in the said Marsh, To repair the Walls and
Watergages of the same Marsh, against the dangers of the Sea. And also upon all
those which are bound and charged for the reparation of the said Walls and A
power granted to the 24 Iurates to make Distresses.
Watergages: We have granted to the same four and twenty, that for the safety
of the said Marsh, they cause those distresses to be done, so that they be made
equal, according to the portions greater and lesser, which men have in the same
Marsh, and according to that which some are bound and charged. And therefore we
will and grant, that none of our Sheriffs of The Sheriff or his Officers not to
intermeddle with those Distresses.
Kent, or any his Bailiffs, do in any wise intermeddle touching those
Distresses made by consideration of the same four and twenty Jurors to avoid
the same danger. For whosoever shall bring Complaint unto us, of the
consideration of those Distresses, we will cause Justice to be done unto him in
our Court, and that Justice we reserve specially to our self, or our special
Commandment. In witness whereof, these Letters we have caused to be made
Patents. Witness my self at S. Edmonds, the second day of September, in the six
and thirtieth year of our Reign.

The Ordinance of Henry of Bathonia, Justice of our Lord King Henry, Son of
King John, made by Precept of the same Lord the King, upon contention arisen
between the four and twenty Jurors, and the men of Romney Marsh, touching
reparation of the Walls and Watergages there being, at Romney, on Saturday next
after the Nativity of the blessed Virgin Mary, in the two and fortieth year of
the said King Henry, adjoining to him Nicholas of Handlo, and Aulred of Dene,
etc.

Our Lord the King has given in The Ordinance of Henry de Bathonia.
charge to Henry of Bathonia, that whereas Judgment ought to be done by four
and twenty lawful men of Romney-Marsh, to distrain upon all those which have
Lands and Tenements in the said Marsh, to repair the Walls and Watergages of
the same Marsh, against the force of the Sea, and inundation of other Waters,
and also upon all those which are bound and charged with the reparation of the
same Walls and Watergages. And to the same four and twenty Iuror^ our Lord the
King by his Letters Patents Recital of the Charter of H. 3.
has lately granted, That for safety of the said Marsh, they should cause
Distresses to be made, so that they may be duly done, according to the
portions, greater or less, which men have in the same Marsh, and according as
some are bound and holden hereunto. So that no Sheriff of Kent of our Lord the
King, or any his Bailiffs, do in any wise intermeddle with those Distresses
made by consideration of the foresaid four and twenty Jurors for avoiding the
danger aforesaid. But if any should think himself grieved unjustly touching the
consideration of those Distresses, and would complain thereof, he should bring
his Complaint unto him our Lord the King, and he would cause Justice to be done
to him in his Court, and that Justice had specially reserved to him our Lord
the King, or to his special Mandate. The said four and twenty Jurors (for the
consideration and resistance of certain men of the same Marsh, which are bound
to repair The Jurors being resisted by the Men of the Parish, cannot make their
Distresses.
the same Walls and Watergages, according to the Quantity of the Lands and
Tenements which they have in the same Marsh) cannot make the same Distresses,
whereby the Walls and Watergages lie ruinated, By reason whereof the
Inundations of the Sea and other Waters do overflow a great part thereof, to
the great detriment The King appoints Henry de Bathe his Justicer to hear and
determine the Controversy between the Jurors and Men of the Marsh.
of our said Lord the King, and men of the same Marsh. He our Lord the King,
has appointed the said Henry, his Iusticer, to hear and determine the
contentions arisen touching the same reparation, between the same four and
twenty Jurors, and men of the said Marsh. And to provide for security and
defense of the said Marsh against inundation and peril of the Sea and other
Waters, by reparation of the said Walls and Watergages to be made by them which
are bound to repair it, according to the quantity of the Lands and Tenements
which they have in the same Marsh, and according to that which some are
otherwise bound and holden hereunto. Our said Lord the King commanding the said
Henry, that at the day and place which he should limit, he should provide to
dispatch the same, as is aforesaid: And what he shall do therein, that to him
the said Lord the King he make known distinctly and plainly in writing, that
the same Lord the King might cause it to be enrolled, etc.

By which Mandate, the said Henry, in the day aforesaid being at Romney,
joining to him the same Nicholas de Handlo, and Aulred of Dene, and the Sheriff
of Kent assisting him, which by Precept The Ordinance of Henry de Bathonia.
of our Lord the King at the same day, caused to come before him so many and
such honest and lawful men of his Bailiwick, by which the same Strifes may be
ended, and the same provision may the better be effected, none of the same
Marsh then withstanding it: The said HENRY in the presence of the Commonalty of
the said Marsh then being there with their Counsel pleading, Ordained as
follows: That is to say, that by the That twelve men shall be chosen, viz.
six of the Fee of the Archbishop, and six of the Barony, to measure the Walls
and the Lands subject to danger.
whole Commonalty of the same Marsh, twelve lawful men may be chosen, to wit,
six of the Fee of the Archbishop of Canterbury, and six of the Barony, which
being sworn, shall measure the Walls new and old, and those which ought to be
new erected. And the same measuring should be done by one and the same Perch,
to wit, of twenty foots. And afterward the same Jurors upon their Oaths also
by the same Perch shall measure by all the Acres Lands and Tenements which are
subject to danger within the same Marsh: Which measurings being done, the
twenty four by the Commonalty first elected and sworn, having respect to the
quantity of the Walls, Lands and Tenements which are subject to peril, by their
Oath, shall ordain how much appertains to every one to uphold and repair the
same Walls. So that for the portion of Acres of Lands lying subject to danger,
there be assigned to every one his portion of Perches by certain Bounds: so as
it may be known where and by what places every The Jurors to assign to every
man his portion of Perches by certain Bounds, according to the portion of Acres

peril and force of Sea ought to be withstood by repairing the same Walls, And
there ought to come the four and twenty Jurors to see through which of the same
places such need chances, and to whom the same places were assigned be
defended, and ought the same time to be repaired. Which common Bailiff shall
give notice to them, to whom the same Common Bailiff to give notice to repair

within the time by the same four and twenty Jurors appointed. Within which time
if they neglect to do it, the said common Bailiff of his own charge shall
repair such defaults by the view of the four and twenty Jurors, and the same
party neglecting, shall be compelled to pay double Costs to the same Bailiff
for his Charges laid out upon the same reparations, which double must be
reserved for the benefit of the same Reparations. And moreover, the negligent
herein may be distrained by his Lands within the same Marsh. And if any Perches
of Lands be holden in common ot Partners, so that to every Partner, a certain
place for the portion of his part cannot be appointed, to wit, all or half a

also the Tenor of the Charter of our Lord the King to the communalty of the
said Marsh granted, that no Sheriff, nor any his Bailiff or Minister make any
Distress within the same Marsh, by occasion of any the said Articles, as in the
said Charter is contained; which Charter, this Ordinance notwithstanding shall
continue in his perpetual force, etc.

The King to the Sheriff of Kent The Kings Writ to the Sheriff of Kent,
commanding him not to meddle with the distresses made by the Jurates.
greeting. Whereas we lately appointed our beloved and faithful Henry de
Bathonia to hear and determine variances depending between four and twenty
lawful men of Romney-Marsh, by whose consideration the Walls and Watergages of
the same Marsh against the force of the Sea and peril of other Waters there
overflowing, Callis Lect. 155.
ought to be repaired, and such as have other Lands and Tenements in the same
Marsh, which ought and were wont to repair those Walls and Watergages. And the
said Henry going in person to those parts, ordained, that according to the
consideration of the said four and twenty Jurors Distresses should be made for
reparation of the said Walls and Watergages. So that no Sheriff or other our
Bailiff do intermeddle with the same Distresses, as in the Rolls of our
Chancery expressing that Ordinance is contained. Nevertheless, you have
released those Distresses for this Deed by four and twenty Jurors, to the
prejudice of their consideration. And because, if any think himself grieved of
the same consideration, for which he will complain, he ought to come to us to
seek remedy. We command you, that in no wise you meddle with the same
Distresses, but cause them to be returned by the four and twenty Jurors and
their Bailiff appointed hereunto, that no further complaint thereof come to us
for which we may be displeased with you. Witness my self at Westminster the
twentieth day of April, in the three and fortieth year of our Reign, by Henry
de Bathonia, etc.

Then follows the number of all the Acres within the same Marsh, as is found
by measure taken in the two and fortieth year of King Henry, and also the
agistation as well in the great Wall of Apuldre, as in the little Wall, to the
quantity of the Lands holden within, etc.

Fauconer against Hamo Pit, and alios for entering into his Manor of Hurst and
taking away his Goods and Chattels.
le Long, and John Ermynard, were attached to answer unto Godfrey le Fauconer,
for that they with others, lately came to the Manor of the said Godfrey in
Hurst, and his Goods and Chattels there found to the value of twenty pounds,
took and carried away, and oher Damages and Brievances to him there did, to his
great loss, and against the Peace, etc. And whereof the said Godfrey
complains, that on Thursday in Easterweek in the year, etc. the same Hamo
with others, took ten ^ine in the Town of Hurst, etc. whereby he says, he is
damnified, and has lost to the value, etc. and thereupon brings suit, etc.
And the said Hamo and others came and defended, The Defendants Plea.
etc. and so far forth as is against the Peace, etc. when, etc. and they well
acknowledge that they took ten Kine aforesaid, etc. of the said Godfrey justly,
Pleads by the Custom and Charter, and Justifies as Bailiff for a Distress taken
for Repairing the Walls, etc.
and in the Peace of our Lord the King, because, he says that the said Godfrey
has Lands, ^ etc. in Romney Marsh, where all the Tenants having Lands and
Tenements in the same Marsh, ought according to the quantity of their Land, to
make Walls and Watergages against the Sea for the inundations of the Waters,
and four and twenty lawful men of the same Marsh being chosen by the Communalty
of the same Marsh, and the Iurates ought to make Distresses upon the Tenants in
the same Marsh, according to the quantity of their Tenements, when it shall be
needful, to repair the same Walls and Watergages. Which Iurats in the same
Marsh, as the manner is, for that they all could not be at leisure, have chosen
the said Hamo to distrain, and have made him their Bailiff to do it, and this
liberty they have by Ancient Custom of the same Marsh, and by Charter of our
Lord the King, which they produce, in these words, Henry by the Grace of God,
etc. Whereby he says, that by means of the default of the said Godfrey, he
lawfully took the same Distress for repairing the same Walls and Watergages, of
which in the Wall of Apuldre there were assigned to him for his part, by the
same Iurates, three Perches and half at the least at his Charges to be
repaired, And more, according to the Inundations of Waters, if it shall be
needful through diverse places, and that they take a greater Distress, unless
they will do it, they put themselves upon their Country, etc. Notwithstanding,
they say they took of one A. B. six Bullocks, who was the Farmer of the said
Godfrey, and ten Lambs of I. N. Tenants of the same Godfrey, by reason of the
defects of the same Walls and Watergages, for which they afterward paid, and
had their Beasts again. Being required for what they made the first Distress,
and for how much the second, they say, that the first Default of the said
Godfrey was esteemed at four Marks, and the second Default at The Plaintiffs
Replication that he claims his Land by Charter from the King and therefore
ought to be discharged from Repairs.
48 shillings. And the same Godfrey says, that he holds his Tenements in the
same Marsh of the Gift and Grant of the Lord Henry, late King of England,
Grandfather to our now Lord King Henry, the which the same Lord Henry has
given to one William the Son of Balder, the Predecessor of the said Godfrey,
whose Heir, etc. By which Grant, his Predecessors and he afterward held his
Tenements in the same Marsh, always as freely and quietly as the said Balder
held them before. And they say, that neither of his Predecessors nor of him any
such Custom was ever sought to repair the same Walls and Watergages, unless
five years past, after that the said Hamo was made Bailiff, to keep Prescribes
genegenerally in non reparando. Vid. Callis Lect. fol. 177.
the same Walls and Watergages, neither did they ever at any time do it. And he
brings the Charter of the said King Henry, in these words: Henry by the Grace
of God, King of England, etc. To the Archbishop of Canterbury, etc. And says,
that by the same Feoffment, his Ancestors have held the same Tenements so
freely, that they never made nor repaired the Walls nor Watergages, neither was
he, after that he held those Lands nor his Predecessors Distreined, until now
five or six years past, that the said Hamo and others have took the Beasts and
as they know which made upon him the same Distress for Default of Reparation of
the same Walls and Watergages, which neither he nor his Predecessors have done,
nor ever used to do, desires Judgment of The Defendants Rejoinder.
their Acknowledgment. And the said Hamo and others say, that sometimes there
was Contravers betwixt the Tenants in the said Marsh upon the Reparation of the
same Walls and Watergages, so that Plea was moved thereby in the County before
the Sheriff, for which the four and twenty Iurats finding themselves grieved,
came to the Court of our Lord the King, and complained of the said Sheriff,
alleging that the same Plea appertained not not to the Sheriff to be holden,
so that by Counsel of our Lord the King it was provided that there might be
sent the Justices of our Lord the King, to ordain and dispose that which should
be meet to appease those Strifes. So that Henry Henry de Bathonia, his
Ordinance pleaded.
de Bathonia was sent thither, and all the Tenants of the said Marsh had
Summons of forty days, as he was in the Journey with the Justices. And the said
Henry, having seen the Walls and Waterbanks aforesaid up assent and will of the
whole communalty of the said Marsh, has ordained that the Archbishops,
Bishops, Abbots, Priors, Earls, Barons, and all Tenants in the same Marsh,
shall contribute, according to the quantity of their Tenure, to make again the
same Walls and Watergages, whereby as the said Godfrey will be defended by the
Walls and Watergages, he requires that he contribute to repair them, as before
the said Justice it was ordained. And that the ordinance is such as aforesaid,
he refers himself to the Record of the Rolls of the said Henry de Bathonia.
Also he says, that it is needful that he Contribute to repair the same Walls,
etc. for that he says, that except his Land should be defended by the said
Walls, all his Land would be overflown and washed. And the said Godfrey says,
that although the same Ordinance had been made by the said The Plaintiffs
Surrejoynder.
Henry, the said Godfrey never consented thereto, neither was Summoned nor
called to come before him to make the same Ordinance: He also says, that That
he never consented to the Ordinance of Hen. de Bathonia, and that neither
before nor since the said Ordinance he nor his Ancestors never made such
Contribution.
neither before the Ordinance nor after, he nor his Predecessors did lately
make such Contribution, but always held their Land quietly from all manner of
exaction according to the Tenor of the said Charter of King Henry, Grandfather
to the now King, until two years past, the said Hamo and others took his
Beasts, whereof he prays Judgment whether the same do hurt him in this
behalf. And the said Hamo and others say that he had a Common Summons of forty
days, Defendant replies that he had a Common Summons as the other had.
as all the Communalty of the same Marsh had, which he ought not to be ignorant
of; whereby he says, That although he would not come thither as he ought with
his Neighbors, he ought not to be therefore freed from the same Contribution
to repair the Walls, insomuch that it is the common benefit of all the Tenants
in the said Marsh; that as well his Land as the Land of the other Tenants may
be defended by the same Walls and Watergages, whereof he desires Judgment. He
also says, That, after the same Ordinance, the said Godfrey and those men have
given a Mark to repair the Walls and Watergages aforesaid before the said Hamo
was Bailiff, and that he is ready to verify the same, etc. And Godfrey says
that he holds himself to the same Charter of our Lord the King, and to his
Liberty which he and his Predecessors used, against which none Ordinance being
made by the said Henry, can nor ought to hurt him, and he well defends, that
neither he nor any by him, has given any thing at any time, before the said
Ordinance nor after to the same Reparation. And this he is Issue joined.
ready to verify, etc. Afterward in the morrow after Saint Martin in the two
and fortieth year, there came the said G. H. and others, etc. And it was
commanded to the Sherist, that he cause to come, in three Ven. fac. awarded.
weeks after Easter wheresoever, twelve as well Knights, as, etc. by which, etc.
And which nether, etc. nor have Lands in the said Marsh, etc. if the said
Godfrey and his Predecessors after that they had his Land of Hurst, of the Gift
and Grant of our Lord Henry, King of England, etc. together with other men,
having Land in the said Marsh, were wont to repair the Walls and Watergages,
and to contribute with the same men to repair them when it has been needful,
whereof the said Godfrey by a certain Ordinance in which he granted before
Henry de Bathonia, whom the Lord the King had sent in that behalf, gave a Mark
to repair the said Walls and Watergages before the said Hamo was Bailiff of the
said Marsh, as the said H. and I. do affirm, or if the said Godfrey or his
Predecessors were freed from those Reparations of the Walls and Watergages and
things incident thereto, by Charter of the said King Henry, Grandfather, etc.
So that the said Godfrey has not agreed to the same Ordinance, nor ever gave
any thing to repair the same Walls and Watergages, as the said Godfrey
alleges, because as well, etc. Afterward from three weeks after Easter, in
the two and fortieth year the Sheriff has not sent his Writ, therefore he in
pity, etc. that is to to say, Fulk Payforor, therefore as before it is given in
charge to the Sheriff, that he cause to come here fifteen days after the day of
S. Trinity wheresoever, etc. twelve, etc. by which etc. and which neither, etc.
Afterward at that day there came the said Godfrey, H. and others, and desired
Judgment to be done according to the Record and Process of the same Plea, and
the Plea was recited before the Lord the King and his Counsel, and because it
is found according to that Record, that the Lord the King had otherwise sent
Henry de Bathonia his Justice thereunto assigned to the same Romney-Marsh, who
disposed that all those which had Lands and Tenements in the same Marsh* should
according to the quantity of their Tenements, Contribute to repair the Walls
and Watergages of the said Marsh, as the said Hamo and others allege, to which
Contribution the said Godfrey is not bound, as the said Godfrey says, neither
as yet is it manifest in the Court of the King here, of the same Ordinance and
Disposition, without the which they cannot rightly proceed unto Judgment. Day
is given them in 15. days after the day of S. Michael wheresoever, etc. And in
the mean space the Rolls of the time of the said Henry de Bathonia are sought,
and it must be known that it is forbidden that the said Hamo distrain the said
Godfrey whilst the Plea depends. Afterward in 15. days, after the day of S.
Michael in the 43 year, etc. the said Godfrey came, The Plaintiff withdrew his
Writ. and is in Misericordia.
and withdrew himself of his Writ against the said Hamo and others, etc. And
therefore he in pity, etc. And further he granted for himself and his Heirs,

of Romney and Oxney to the County of Sussex.

Before J. de Lovetot, and H. of Appledorefeild at Romney the fifth day of
December in the sixteenth year of King Edward, Son of King Henry.

Our Lord the King has sent to his welbeloved The Commission of E. 1. to Jo.
Lovetot and Hen. Appledorefeild to view the Walls of the Sea Coast.
and faithful John de Lovetot, and Henry de Appledorefeild his Writ in these
words, Edward by the Grace of God, King of England, Lord of Ireland, and Duke
of Aquitane, to our welbeloved John de Lovetot, and Henry de Appledorefeild
greeting. Know ye that whereas we are bound by reason of our Princely Dignity,
and by Oath to provide for the safety of our Kingdom. We have assigned on every
side you to oversee the Walls and Ditches by the Sea Coast, and the parts
thereto adjoining in the County of Kent, diversely ruynated by the stage of the
^^ea to enquire by whose default such hurt has happened there, and of all those
which hold Lands and Tenements in those parts, and by any means have Defense
and Safety, or may have Defense or Safety by those Walls and Ditches, and them
for the quantity of their Lands and Tenements, or by the number of Acres of
Land, or by Carucates for the rated portion of their tenure to distrain
together with the Bailiff of the Liberties and others of these parts to repair
them in necessary places as often and where as need shall be, so that none
having Lands or Tenements of this or other, of what Condition, state, or
dignity that they be, which have any Defense by these Walls and Ditches,
whether it be within the liberty or without, shall be spared in this behalf.
And therefore we command you, that for the execution of this business, ye
behave your selves so faithfully and discreetly, that as well men resident in
the same places as their Lands, may be saved against like Perils, and casually
no worse in like manner happen, and you upon that which you shall do and ordain
in this behalf under your Seals, and the Seals of the Jurors, as well Knights,
as other honest and lawful men, you distinctly and publicly certify us. For
we have commanded our Sheriff of the same County, that at certain days and
places which he shall limit them, he shall cause to come so many and such
honest and lawful men of his Bayliwick, by whom the truth of the matter may be
known and enquired in the premises, in witness whereof, etc. Witdess Edmund
Earl of Cornwall our Constable at Westminster the fifteenth day of November,
in the sixteenth year of our Reign

By which Mandate it was commanded A Mandate to the Sheriff to return a Panel.
to the Sheriff, that he should come before the said Justices here at this day,
four and twenty Jurors of Romney-Marsh, and all the Lords of the Towns of the
same Marsh, and such and so many honest and lawful men of the several Lands
near to the Sea Coast in his Bayliwick, by which the truth of the matter in the
premises may the better be known and inquired of, and further to do that which
in the premises shall be ordained, who now came. And the said four and twenty
Jurors of the same Marsh, together The Jurors and Communalty plead the Charter
of H. 8. and the privileges thereby to them granted.
with the communalty of the said Marsh alleged, that the Lord, King Henry,
Father of the now King, by his Charter has granted unto them certain liberties
in his Lands of the same Marsh, and required that their liberties aforesaid may
be reserved unto them, and that nothing be attempted or ordained to the
prejudice of the same liberties, and produce a Charter of the Lord Henry our
King aforesaid in these words, Henry by the Grace of God, etc. They also
alleged, that the Lord the King, The Ordinance of Henry de Bathonia pleaded.
Father of our now Lord the King, in the two and fiftieth year of his Reign, by
reason of certain discord arisen amongst diverse men of the same Marsh, by means
of repairing the same Walls and Watergages, did send Henry de Bathonia his
Iusticer to those parts, to hear and determine the strifes grown of the same
Reparation, between four and twenty Jurors, and the men of the said Marsh, and
to provide for the safety and defense of the said Marsh, against the
overflowing and danger of the Sea and other Waters, by Repairing the said Walls
and Watergages by them, which for Reparation thereof, are bound according to
the quantity of their Lands and Tenements which they have in the same Marsh.
Whereby they affirm that the said Henry de Bathonia, by Authority of the same
Mandate of our Lord King Henry aforesaid, has Ordained and Established for
them there a certain Law and Ordinance, by which that Marsh is hitherto kept
and conserved, and therefore require that by that Ordinance and Law that may
hereafter be tried and defended, as heretofore they have been accustomed. And
to that end they brought the same Ordinance of the said Henry de Bathonia,
under the Seal of our Lord the King, in these words: Before Henry de Bathonia,
etc. as before, etc.

And because the Ordinance of the said Henry plainly seems agreeable to
equity, and hitherto has been allowed. It is commanded and appointed that the
same Ordinance be in all points observed without A Confirmation of the
Ordinance of Henry de Bathonia.
impeachment, adding nevertheless, that because in the same Ordinance nothing
was expressed of the choice of a common Bailiff of our Lord the King in the
same Marsh, by what means and by whom that choice ought to be made, It is
agreed, that from henceforth the said common Bailiff To which is added the
manner of Electing a Common Bailiff.
of the said Marsh departing or deceasing, another which is resident, and has
Lands in the same Marsh, may have his place. And that the same choice from
henceforth be made, by common assent of two Towns of the same Marsh, or by
their Attorneys, and where the greater number agree, it shall stand at their
choice, because it has been so accustomed to be done. And for levying of the
double, and of the Costs bestowed for Reparation of the Defaults of the same
Marsh, for the punishment of such as How the double shall be levied on the
Defaulters.

levied, as in the former Ordinance was appointed, and that the double be
reverted, for the common benefit of repairing the said Marsh, and not The
double Costs to be for the benefit of repairing the Marsh.
be observed for the use of the same Bailiff hereafter. And because in the same
Marsh diverse Walls and Watergages, to whose repairing and maintaining, the
communalty of the same Marsh does not contribute, but only they which have
Lands adjacent and nearest to the said Walls and Watergages, and some by
oppression of the Lords of the said Marsh, do pay but sometimes (...) the
repairing and upholding of the same for 40. Acres, how much others for 50.
Acres, that which shall be more against the Law of the Marsh, and Ordinance of
the said Henry de Bathonia, it is agreed and ordained that notwithstanding any
custom used All that have Lands or Tenements subject to the Danger of the Sea,
and have thereby safety, shall be distrained to repair.
before of any, all and singular having Lands and Tenements, which are subject
to the danger of the Sea, and have there also safety for the same, may
henceforth be distrained to repair and support the Walls and Watergages. So
that all do contribute equally according to the number of Acres which they have
there, so as none be spared, of what state and condition soever they be, which
thereby have safety and defense. And because in that Marsh of Romeney beyond
the Waterstream of that Dock, stretching from Suergate toward Romenhall on the
west part of that Creek unto the County of Sussex, there was no certain Law of
the Marsh appointed nor used, but of such as have Lands at will therein,
whereby diverse perils and intolerable losses had happened by inundation of the
Sea, that from henceforth such dangers may be prevented, and for common benefit
seen into, It is agreed and jointly It is ordained that in the Marshes beyond
the Creek toward Sussex, there be appointed to be chosen by the Commonalty,
Jurors, for the security of those parts, as it is in the Ordinance of Henry de
Bathonia.
ordained, that in the Marsh beyond the same Creek toward Sussex, there be
appointed to be chosen by the communalty, Jurors, which for security of those
parts in this behalf shall be sworn, and having respect to the number of acres,
which are subject to the same peril, and to the quantity of Walls and
Watergages there to be repaired and maintained, by their Oath shall consider
and ordain as much as shall be needful to repair and uphold them. So that every
one for the portion of Acres subject to the same danger, do equally contribute
to sustain them. So that according to the portion of their Acres and their
value; there be assigned to every one in the same Walls and Watergages, his
Portion of Perches to be upholden, as is contained more plainly in the
ordinance of the said Henry de Bathonia. And moreover, for that hitherto in
those parts beyond the same Dock toward Sussex, there was no common Bailiff
appointed, which should provide and take had of the dangers there happening, for
the common good of those parts, and that A Bailiff to be also chosen for the
Marshes beyond the Watercourse toward Sussex.
hereafter no like perils there happen, It is ordained, that henceforth there

Sussex, to oversee and keep and to repair the Walls and Watergages by the

need shall be, and to levy according to the form in the same ordinance of Henry
de Bathonia contained, at the choice of the said Bailiff, when it shall happen
to be done, and that the Lords of the Towns of the same Marsh be always aiding
and called beyond the same Watercourse toward Sussex, if they will be there,
and the Jurors and the whole communalty of the said Marsh. It is also ordained,
that from henceforth the said common Bailiff of the King in Romney-Marsh be

on either side of the said Watercourse, chosen, when it shall be needful, do

The King to his welbeloved and faithful Thomas Lodelow, Robert Belknap, and
Thomas Culpeper, greeting. By the grievous complaint of the reverent Father
Simon Archbishop of Canterbury and others, having Lands within the precinct of
Romney Marsh, we are advertised, That whereas all their Lands lie nigh to the
Sea Coast, and without continual keeping the walls, gutters and ditches and
other defenses, as well for avoiding the seawater, as excluding the fresh
Waters there made, by no means can be defended and saved, For which in the time

Bathonia and his fellows, Justices of the same our Grandfather, to oversee the
Walls, Ditches and Sluices. and the defense thereof, and to cause to be made and
repaired, among others it was Ordained, that whosoever of the Tenants, and men
resident within the said Precinct, whom the greater part of the Lords having
Rule within the said Precinct would chose, should be Bailiff to levy the
Assessments for reparations and upholding the Walls, Sluices, Ditches and
Defenses aforesaid: as in the same Ordinances is more apparent, and albeit,
according to the same Ordinances, John at Lose Tenant and resident within the
same Precinct, to the said Office of Bailiff to levy the Assessments aforesaid,
by the Lords of the same Marsh in form aforesaid within that precinct was
chosen and deputed: notwithstanding Matthew at More and other his confederates
by their false Deceits being confederate and knit together, to make another
Bailiff there by their own assent, which might be partial to his Friends, and
unduly burden others against the said Ordinances, did so terrify the said
John, and cruelly threaten him, and otherwise hinder him, that he cannot nor
dare take upon him the Office accordingly, and so in default of the same
Bailiff, all the said Marsh by overflowing of Waters daily coming, remains in
peril to be spoiled, unless speedy redress in this behalf be had. We respecting
the hurt and peril, which as well to us, as to all our Kingdom, and specially
in those parts, by overflowing hereof, unless meet defense to Commissioners to
oversee the Walls and the Ordinances made touching the same.

these hurts and dangers, have assigned you, three or two of you, to oversee and
repair the Walls, Sluices, Ditches, and their Defenses made in the same Marsh,
and to oversee the same Ordinances, and in case that the Ordinances for the
safety and defense of the said Marsh be found insufficient for the same
overflowing, The Commissioners empowered to correct the Ordinances where
defective, and to make new if occasion require.

done, in any wise will not come, or will forsake your Decrees: And that you
cause the same Ordinances to be proclaimed, that they may be for ever
Circumspectly observed in those parts, and that ye cause all things else to be
performed, which for the safety and defense of the said Marsh, and excluding
and avoiding the same Waters, shall be needful and fit. And also to enquire by

Confederacies, Covins, Allegations, Trespasses, and Contempts aforesaid to be
heard and determined according to the Law and Custom of our Realm. And
therefore we command you, that at certain days and places which you, three or
two of you shall limit in that behalf, ye hear and determine all and singular
