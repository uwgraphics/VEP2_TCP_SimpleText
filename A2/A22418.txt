A Proclamation to declare and publish His Majesty's resolution, to ascertaine
His Revenue, by granting His Lands holden as well by Copy, as otherwise in
Fee-Farme.
WHereas at Our access unto the Imperial Crown of this Realm, We found the
Treasures thereof exhausted, the Revenue of Our Lands much diminished, and yet
a great mass of Debts lying upon Us, and a daily charge, which in an ordinary
course must be borne for the support of Our Honor, and a more then
extraordinary charge for the necessary defense of Our Kingdoms, We being
embarked in a War at Our first coming to the Crown: And when We entered
into a serious consideration of the several parts of Our Revenue, We found
them much too short to maintain Our ordinary Expenses, much less the
extraordinary, which are nevertheless unavoidable. To the end therefore, that
We might be fully and truly informed of the present state of Our Revenue in
every part thereof, and of the burden which lies upon it, and so be better
enabled, for the future, to dispose and settle the same in such an order, as
that We might with more comfort manage Our Estate, We thought it fit to make
choice of some Persons of quality and experience, to be Our Commissioners for
Our Revenue, and they to take into their especial care and considerations, by
what just and honorable means, We might retrench all undue or unnecessary
Charges, issuing out of Our Revenue, or Coffers, and how to advance and
improoue such parts thereof, as might admit of an improouement; which Our
Commissioners having returned to Us an Account of their pains from time to
time in this Our Service, We find by them that the casual profits of Our
Lands, either by Fines for Leases, or Copyhold Estates, Herriots, Reliefes, or
therwise, have, Communibus annis, yielded to Us, or Our Crown, in diverse
years past, but a small Sum, nor is like to do in many years yet to come;
And yet out of the same there are issuing diverse Annual Fees and Payments,
amounting in the whole to a great yearly value.

We therefore, by the advice of Our said Commissioners, intending to reduce
Our Revenue to a more certainty, and to improoue our yearly Rents in those
places where it may conveniently admit of such improouement, to abate Our
unnecessary charge issuing thereout, and yet to raise a present Sum of Money
toward the defraying of those great expenses, which for the public defense
of Our people and Kingdoms We cannot avoid, and for the supply whereof, We
are resolved to spare nothing which lies in Our power, and for the satisfying
of those just debts, which daily cry in Our ears, have resolved, and by these
Presents do declare and publish Our Resolution to all Our loving Subjects whom
it may concern, That We will grant in Fee-Farme, all, or any of Our Honors,
Manours, Lands, Tenements, Woods, and other Hereditaments, both in the Survey
of Our Exchequer, and of Our Duchy of Lancaster, as well such as are held by
Copy, as by Lease, Custody, or otherwise, and as well such as are yet in the
hands of Our Commissioners when We were Prince, as other our Lands in Mortgage,
(which We purpose forthwith to redeem) those Manors and Lands only excepted,
which are parcel of Our Duchy of Cornwall. And to this end We purpose
forthwith to nominate certain persons under Our Great Seal of England, to be
Our Commissioners, to whom We will give full power and authority, for Us, and
in Our Name, to treat and conclude with any persons, for any parts thereof,
as well Quillets and Parcels, as entire Manours, at, and for such increase of
Rents, or Fine, or both, as they in their good discretions shall think fit,
and agree upon: And We have thought good thus to publish Our Pleasure and
Resolution herein, that the present Tenants of Our Lands, and all other Our
loving Subjects may take notice thereof, and may know whither, and to whom to
make their repair for this purpose; To which end We will appoint Our said
Commissioners to attend this Our Service on the twentieth day of September
next, and so from time to time thence forward, at the Chamber, commonly called
the Painted Chamber, in Our Palace at Westminster, whither Our pleasure is,
that all such of Our Subjects, as shall be desirous to purchase any of Our
said Lands in Fee-Farme, as aforesaid, shall resort to make their agreements
accordingly. And because this Our Resolution may take that effect which We
desire and expect, Our Will and Command is, that from henceforth, until Our
further Pleasure be known herein, no Estate or Lease by Copy or otherwise,
be renewed, granted, or altered by any, but by Oursayd Commissioners only.

Given at Our Court at Nonesuch, the thirteenth day of August, in the second
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland. God save the King.
