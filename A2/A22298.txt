HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE

DIEV ET MON DROIT

By the King.
WHereas We for the continuance, and mainteining of the Navigations of this
Realm, and to the intent that skillful Mariners and Seafaring men might be
always in readiness to furnish, as well Our own Royal Navy, as the Shipping
of Our Subjects, by Our Proclamation, dated the sixth day of August last past,
did straightly inhibite and forbid, that no Mariner or Seafaring man,
Ship-wright, or Ship-carpenter whatsoever, being Our Subject, should without
express license of Us, or of Our Admiral of England, enter, or attempt, or
go about to enter into the service of any foreign Prince or State, or be
employed out of this Realm in any service, (unless it were in the service of
Us, or of some of Our Liege Subjects;) Nevertheless, We have received
Information, that notwithstanding the strictness of that Our Commandment,
great numbers of Mariners and Seafaring men, contrary to their duty and
allegiance, and against the Laws of this Realm, have presumed without such
license to go abroad, and serve other Princes and States in foreign parts, to
the great prejudice of Traffic and dishonor of Our own service, And that
very great and insufferable abuses are committed by such Mariners and
Seafaring men, as do purposely withdraw, or wilfully refuse to perform those
urgent and important services, wherein We have occasion to make use of them: We
have thought good to signify Our pleasure, that Our said former Proclamation
be hereafter carefully observed and put in exact execution, Willing that all
men should take knowledge, and that We shall esteem the offenders therein, as
Fugitives and Runnagates, forgetting their natural allegiance and duty to Us
and Our Laws, and accordingly shall proceed against them with all severity.
And furthermore We do straightly charge and command, that no Mariner or
Seafaring man, absent, hide, or withdraw himself from Our service or Prests,
and that all such persons, having Our Prest-money given or tendered unto them,
do duetifully and reverently receive the same, and repair aboard Our Ships
at the times to them limited and assigned, and thencefoorth continue in Our
service, as to the duty of good Subjects appertains, and do not withdraw
themselves or depart therefrom without especial license, upon pain to incur
the uttermost severity of Our Laws, which We resolve shall be extended to
them as Malefactors in very high degree, to the hazard of Our Royal Navy and
service. And We do further charge and straightly Command, that no person or
persons that shall be trusted or employed for the presting of any Mariners, or
other persons to be employed in Our service at Sea, do at any time for favor,
reward, or other sinister respect, forbear to pressed the ablest and fittest men
for such Our service, or having pressed them, do discharge them again, or
change them for persons less able and sufficient; And that no Lieutenants,
Masters, Pursors, Gunners, Boteswaines, or other inferior officers in any of
Our Ships, nor any other, but such only, as by the due orders of Our Navy
are allowed so to do, do at any time hereafter presume to discharge any
Mariners, or other person prested to serve in any Our Ships, it being Our
full resolution, that Our Navy being by Our Princely providence and care
restored to as good and serviceable estate, as any former time has known it,
the Officers, Mariners and other persons appointed to serve therein shall be
so regulated and kept in order in their several services and employments, as
may best agree to Our Honor, and the public safety of this Our Realm. And
therefore if any person or persons whatsoever, after this Our admonition and
warning, shall presume to offend in any thing before remembered, they shall not
only incur Our Indignation and high displeasure, but shall be subject to the
seuerest punishment that Our Laws or Royal Prerogative may inflict upon them.

Given at Our Court at New Market the seven and twentieth day of February, in
the twentieth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
God save the King.

most Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXII
