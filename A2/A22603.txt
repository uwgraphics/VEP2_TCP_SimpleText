A Proclamation touching the Corporation of Bever-makers of London, and to
restrain the Importing of foreign Hats, and the wearing of Demy-casters within
his Majesty's Dominions.
WHereas, notwithstanding the Princely care of Our late dear and Royal Father
King JAMES of blessed memory, for the necessary maintenance and preservation of
the Manufacture of Hats and Caps within this Kingdom, in prohibiting by
several Proclamations the Importation into the same from foreign parts, of any
Hats or Caps whatsoever, either wrought or half wrought, upon pain of the
forfeiture of the same; We now find that abundance of Hats and Caps, as well of
Bever-stuffe, or Bever-wooll, as of other Wool and materials made and wrought
in foreign parts, are frequently imported into this our Kingdom, to the great
impoverishment and depriving of multitudes of Our poor subjects of their
livelihood and employment.

We tendering the common good of our said subjects, and that for the time to
come they may be enabled to live, and maintain themselves and families, by
their honest labors in their said trades; And that the Art and Mystery of
making or working of Hats and Caps of Bever-stuffe or Bever-wooll within Our
said Kingdom, may be regulated in a just and orderly way, without the deceits
and abuses now practiced in the same, (the wearing of Bever-Hats being of late
times become much in use, especially by those of sort and quality) Have thought
fit to incorporate sundry persons Freemen of London, expert in the art of
making or working Hats and Caps of Bever-stuffe or Bever-wooll, who accordingly
are to govern the said trade, and may be answerable to Us for the same.

And therefore We do straightly charge and command all person and persons
whatsoever, as well Our natural born subjects, as denizens or strangers, That
they or any of them directly or indirectly, do not from henceforth at any time
or times hereafter, import, convey, or bring, or cause to be imported,
conveyed, or brought into Our Realm of England or Dominion of Wales, any Hats
or Caps of Bever, or other Hats or Caps, of what condition or sort soever,
made, wrought or half wrought, or hereafter to be made, wrought or half
wrought, in any parts beyond the Seas, to be sold or put to sale here. And that
no person or persons whatsoever, after the twelfth day of August next coming,
shall sell or put to sale, or shall have in their houses or shops, to sell or
put to sale, any of the said foreign Hats, or Caps, already imported into this
Our Realm of England, and Dominion of Wales, upon pain of the loss and
forfeiture of the same, and such further punishment as shall be meet for such
their contempt, the one half of which forfeitures to be to the use of Us, Our
Heirs, and successors, and the other half of the said Bever-hats or Hats mixed
with Bever so to be imported, to be to the use of the said Bever-makers and
their successors; and the moity of all other Felts so to be imported, to be to
the use of the Company of Felt-makers of London, and their successors.

And to the end that the said Corporation of Bever-makers, Our natural born
Subjects, may be constantly employed in their said Trade, We do hereby
straightly charge and command, that no person or persons whatsoever within Our
said Realm of England, or Dominion of Wales, at any time or times hereafter,
do presume to use or execise the Trade or Mystery of making or working of Hats
or Caps of Bever-stuffe or Bever-wooll, to be sold or put to sale, unless such
persons have commonly used the said Trade by the space of two years last past,
or have served an Apprentiship to the same by the space of seven years: And
that no person or persons whatsoever, for the time to come, shall use or
practice the said Trade, unless he or they have been or shall be first bound
and brought up as Apprentice or Apprentices in the same Trade by the space of
seven years at the least, and are or shall be members of the said Corporation,
upon pain of Our high displeasure, and such punishments as shall be meet for
the offenders herein, for such their contempts of Our Royal commands, and the
loss and forfeiture of all such Bever-hats and Caps as shall be so made, to be
seized to Our use, the one moitie to be to Us, Our Heirs and Successors; and
the other moitie to be to the Company of Bever-makers and their successors.
And we do hereby declare, that there is no Intention by the said Charter made
to the said Bever-makers, or any Grant therein concerning search to be made by
them, that the power of search formerly granted to the Company of Haverdashers
of London, or to the Company of Felt-makers of London, should in any sort be
impeached.

And for that diverse of Our Subjects have heretofore found inconvenience in the
use of Bever-Hats intermixed with other hair or stuff then Bever, We do
therefore straightly charge and command, that no Bever-makers whatsoever from
henceforth shall make any Hats or Caps but of pure Bever, and that in the
making or working thereof, they or any of them shall not intermix, use, or
work, or cause to be intermixed, used, or wrought, any hair, wool, or stuff
whatsoever, other then good and perfect Bever, upon pain of the loss and
forfeiture of the same, the one moitie to Us, Our Heirs, and Successors; and
the other to such as shall seize the same. And Our Will and pleasure is, that
if upon any search to be made by the said Company of Haberdashers of London, or
by the said Company of Bever-makers, there shall be found in any of the houses,
shops, Warehouses or Workhouses, of any of the said Bever-makers, or in any
other place for their or any of their uses, any hair, wool, or stuff
whatsoever used in making of Hats or Caps other then Bever-stuffe only, That
then the same shall be seized by such of the said Companies of Haberdashers and
Bever-makers as shall so find the same as forfeited, the one half thereof to
be to Us, Our Heirs, or Successors, and the other half thereof to such of the
said Companies as shall so find and seize the same. And Our further Will and
pleasure is, That if the said Company of Haberdashers, or the said Company of
Bever-makers, upon any search by them, or either of them to be made, shall
find any deceitful Bever-Hats, or Caps, that then the same shall by them that
shall so find the same, be seized and carried to the Guild Hall of Our City
of London, there to be tried by Jury, and in case they shall be there condemned
for such, then the same to be consumed by fire; The said Charter of
Incorporation made to the said Company of Bever-makers, or any Grant, power or
thing therein contained to the contrary thereof in any wise notwithstanding.

And forasmuch as a sort of Hatts called Demycasters, wherein some Bever is
intermixed, are now found not to be useful in Our Dominions, Our Will and
pleasure therefore is, and We do straightly charge and command, That from
henceforth no Haberdashers, nor makers of Demycasters, nor other Hat-makers or
persons whatsoever, after Midsomer day next, shall utter, or sell any Hat or
Hats called Demycasters, or other Hats wherein Bever shall be mixed or wrought,
with other materials by retayl, or have any such Hats in their houses or Shops
to utter or sell by retayl to any of Our Subjects, or others, to be worn
within any Our Dominions: And that none of Our Subjects after one year next
ensuing, shall wear any Demycasters, or other Hat wherein any Bever wool, or
Bever stuff is mixed, or wrought with other materials within Our said
Dominions, upon pain of the loss and forfeiture of the same to be seized and
taken to Our use, the one half thereof to be to Us, Our Heirs and Successors,
and the other half to such as shall seize the same, and upon such further
penalties as shall be meet for such their contempts.

Nevertheless, being informed that the said Demycasters, wherein Bever is mixed
with other materials, are useful and desired in foreign parts: We are pleased
that the said Makers thereof, and other Hat-makers (other then the said
Bever-makers) may still make the said Demycasters; And that they, or any
Haberdashers may sell the same to Merchants in gross, and not otherwise, to be
by them transported from the Port of London only, into parts beyond the seas,
and to be there vented. And that Our Royal intention herein may be duly
observed, We do hereby straightly charge and command, That no
Demycaster-makers, or other Hat-makers, that shall hereafter make any
Demycasters or Hats wherein any Bever-wooll or Bever-stuffe is intermixed with
other materials, shall directly or indirectly sell, or put to sale any
Demycasters or Hats wherein Bever-wooll is mixed with other materials to any
person or persons whatsoever, before he or they first bring the same to the
common Hall or meeting place of the said Bever-makers in Our said City of
London, there from time to time (as they shall be so brought) to be immediately
marked (without fee or duty) upon the banding place of the same Hats with the
letter D, that so they may thereby be known to be Demycasters, or Hats wherein
Bever is mixed with other materials; And that no person or persons whatsoever,
do hereafter buy, or cause to be bought any such Demycasters or mixed Hats
before they have been so marked with the said letter D, upon pain of the loss
and forfeiture of the same Hats, and such further penalties and punishments as
shall be meet for contempt of Our Royal commands herein. And We do hereby
further charge and command, that from henceforth no Merchants or others shall
import or bring into this Our Realm any Bever-wooll, or Bever-stuffe mixted
with sand, or any other stuff whatsoever, to make it weigh heavy, or whereby
the said Bever-wooll or Bever-stuffe shall be corrupted or impaired, under the
penalty of the loss and forfeiture thereof, to be seized to Our use, by such
person or persons as shall discover the same, and to be further punished as
shall be thought meet, the one moitie whereof to be to Us, Our Heirs, and
Successors, and the other moitie to be to the said Corporation of
Bever-makers, and their successors, and also upon pain of Our high
displeasure, and such penalties and punishments, as by the Laws and Statutes of
this Realm, or otherwise may be inflicted on the offenders in the premises
for their contempt and neglect of Our Royal Will and Commandment herein. And
for the accomplishment of this Our pleasure, We do hereby straightly charge and
command all Customers, Comptrollers, and other Officers of Our Ports to whom it
shall appertain, and all Farmours of Our Customs now, and for the time being,
their Clarks and substitutes, that they, and every of them do forbear to take
any Entries of any Bever-Hats, Felt-Hats or Caps, or any other Hats or Caps of
what nature, quality, or condition soever made, wrought, or half wrought
beyond the Seas, that shall be brought into this Realm, or Dominion of Wales,
by any person or persons whatsoever. And likewise all Justices of Peace,
Majors, Sheriffs, Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, and other Officers and
Ministers whatsoever, to whom it shall appertain, that they and every of them,
in their several Offices and places respectively, be careful to their and
every of their powers, that Our Intention herein before mentioned be fully
executed by all lawful means whatsoever; And that they, and every of them be
aiding, favoring, and assisting to the Master, Wardens, Assistants and
Comminalty of Bever-makers of London, or their Deputies, Agents, or Officers
for the time being in the premises according to Our pleasure herein declared,
as they will answer for the contrary at their perils.

Given at Our Court at White Hall, this six and twentieth day of May, in the
fourteenth year of Our Reign.
God save the King.

Majesty: And by the Assigns of John Bill. 1638.
