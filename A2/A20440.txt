Conference with a Lady about choice of Religion.

Printed at Paris. 1638.

MADAME,
My being conscious to my self how confusedly and intricately, I have
delivered my conceptions unto your ladyshippe upon the several occasions of
discourse we have had together concerning that important subject of what faith
and religion is the true one to bring us to eternal happiness (wherein your
Ladyshipp is so wisely and worthily inquisitiue and sollicitous) has begotten
this following writing; in the which I will, as nere as I can, sum up the
heads of those considerations I have sometimes discussed unto you in
conversation. And I will briefly and barely lay them before you without any
long enlargement upon them; as haueing a better opinion of the reflections that
your Ladyshipps great understanding and strong reasoning soul will by your
self make upon the naked subject sincerely proposed, then of any commentary I
can frame upon it. And indeed such discourses as these, are deeper looked into,
when they are po^dered by a prudentiall judgment, then when they are examined
by scientificall speculations.

But with your leave I shall take the matter a little higher then where the
chief difficulty seems to be, at which your Ladyshipp sticks; conceiving
that if we begin at the root and proceed on step by step, we shall find
our search the easyer, and the securer, and our assent to the conclusions we
shall collect, will be the more firm and vigorours.

We will therefore begin with considering why faith and Religion is needful to
a man, before we determine the means how to find out the right faith: for that
being once settled in the understanding, we shall presently without further
dispute reject: what Religion soever is but proposed, that has not those
proprieties which are required to bring that to pass, that Religion in its
own nature aymeth at. And this must be done by taking a survey of some of the
operations of a human soul, and of the impressions made in it by the objects
it is conversant withal,

1. Your Ladyshipp may be pleased the^ to consider in the first place. That it
is by nature ingrafted in the souls of all mankind to desire beatitude. (By
which word I mean an entire, perfect, and secure fruition of all such objects
as one has vehement affections unto, without mixture of any thing one has
auersion from.) For the soul haueing a perpetual actiuity in it, must
necessarily have something to entertain it self about: and according to the
two chief powers of it (which are the understanding and the will) it employeth
it self, first in the search and inuestigatio of what is true and good; and
then, according to the judgment it makes of it, the will follows and with
affections graspeth at it, which if it happen to seize upon, the soul is at
content and at rest; but if it miss, it is unquiet, and labors with all
vehemence to compass it: and if any thing happen that is repugnant to the
nature of it, it uses all industry and efficacious means to overcome and
banish it: so that all the actions and motions of it, tend to gain contentment
and beatitude.

2. In the next place you may please to consider that this full beatitude which
the soul thirsts after, cannot be enjoyed in this life. For it is apparent,
that intellectual goods, as science, contemplation and fruition of spiritual
objects and contentments, in their own nature are the chief goods of the
soul, and affect her much more strongly and violently the^ corporal and
sensual ones can do: for they are more agreeable to her nature, and therefore
move her more efficaciously when they are duly relished. But such
intellectual goods cannot be perfectly relished and inioyed as long as the
soul is immersed in the body, by reason that the sensual appetite makes
continual war against the rational part of the soul; and in most men
mastereth it, and in the perfectest, this earthly habitation does so draw
down and clogge and benumme the noble inhabitant of it (which would always
busy it self in sublime contemplations) as it may be said to be but in a
iayle whiles it resideth here. And experience confirms unto us, that the
sparks of knowledge we gain here are not pure; but have the nature of salt
water, that increases the thirst in them who drink most of it; and we
swallowe the purest streams like men in a dropsy, who the more they drink
are still the greedier of more. Therefore to have this greediness of knowing
satisfied, and to exercise the powers of our soul in the pure and abstracted
contemplation of truth, and in the sincere fruiction of spiritual objects, we
must have patience until she arrive unto an other state of life, wherein being
separated from all corporal feces, impediments, and contradictions, she may
wholly give herself up to that which is her natural operation, and from
whence resulteth her true and perfect delight. Besides, even they who have
attained to the greatest blessings (both inward and outward) that this world
can afforde, yet are far from being completely happy: for that state admits
noe mixture of the contrary, which who was ever yet free from, were his fortune
never so specious? The very fear of loosing them, that must always
necssarily accompagny those blessings, is such a spoonefull of gall to make
their whole draught bitter, as that alone, must needs take of the edge and
vigor of the contentment that else they might enjoy. How little can any man
relish the objects of delight which with never so great affluence beset him
round about, when he knows a sharp and heavy sword hangesh by a slender
thread over his head, and at length must fall, and ever after sever him from
them? A little distemper, an accidental fever, and ill mingled draught (such a
one as the miracle of wit and learning Lucretius met withal) is enough to
turn the brains of the wisest man that is, and in a few hours to blott out
all these notions he has bin all his life laboring to possess himself of,
and to render him of a more abject, and despicable condition then the meanest
wretch living that has but the common use of reason. The Genius that presideth
over human affairs, delights in perpetual changes and variation of men's
fortunes, so that he who late sat enthroned in greatest dignity, is all of a
sudden precipitated headlong unto a condition most opposite thereunto: he
that but yesterday had all his joys enlarged and swelled up to their full
height by the communication of a perfect and entire friend (without which can
there by any true joy?) has to day lost the comfort of all that the world can
afford him by the irrecouerable loss of that one friend. In a word, death
growing daily upon him, and encroaching upon his outworks, and by hours
reducing him into a narrower circle, at leingth seizes upon himself and
makes an eternal divorce between him and what was dearest to him here.

3. Our next consideration then shall be to discover what will result out of
our swifte passadge through this veil of miseries, and what impressions we
shall carry with us out of this pilgrimage; since we cannot suspect it is
aiourney assigned us in vain, being the ordinary and natural course
prescribed by the wise author of nature to all mankind, and the inevitable
through-fare for every man in particular. Therefore to proceed on in this
method, our third conclusion shall be, that what soever judgment the soul
once frames in this life, that judgment and that affection will perpetually
remain in the soul, unless some contrary impression be made in it to blot it
out; which only has power to expel any former one. For judgments and
affections are caused in a man by the impression that the objects make in his
soul: and all that any agent aymeth at in any operation whatsoever (be it
never so forcible in action) is but to produce a resemblance of it self in the
subject it works upon; and therefore it excludes nothing that it finds
formerly there (which in our case is the soul) unless it be some such
impression as is incompatible with what it intends to effect there; or that
the subject is not large enough, both to retain the old and receive the new;
in which case the first must be blotted out to make room for the latter. But
of judgments, and affections, none are inco^patible to one another, but those
that are directly opposite to one another by contradiction: Therefore only such
have power to expel one another; and all that are not such, are immediately
united to the very substance of the soul, which having an infinite capacity,
it can never be filled by any limited objects whatsoever: so that they always
reside in the soul, although they do not at all times appear in outward act;
which proceeds from hence, that new and other images are by the fantasy
represented to the soul, and she seems to busy herself only about what she
finds there, which being but one distinct Image at a time (for corporal
organs have limited comprehensions, and are quickly filled with corporal
species) she thereupon seems to exercise but one judgment; or but one
affection at a time. But as soon as the soul shall be released out of the
body (which is like a dark prison to wall it in) then she will at one and the
same instant actually know and love all those things she knew, and loved in
the body; with only this difference, that her knowledges will then be much more
distinct and perfect, and her affections much more vehement then they were in
this life, by reason that her conjunction here with resistent matter was a
burden, and a clogge unto her, and hindered the actiuitie and force of her
operations. The difference of these states, may in some measure be illustrated
by a gross and material example: Represent unto your self a man walled up in
a dark tower, that is so close as noe air nor light can come into it,
excepting only at one little hole, and that hole too affords no clear and
free passage to the sight, but has a thick and muddy glass before it. Now if
this man would look upon any of the objects that are about this tower, he must
get them to be placed over against that hole, unto which he must lay his eye;
and then, he can discern but one at a time, and that but dimmely nether, and
if he will see several bodies, it must be by so many several iterated acts
as they are in number. But suppose some Earthquake or exterior violence to
break a sunder and throw down to the ground the walls of this tower, leaving
the man untouched and unhurt; then at one instant, and with one cast of his
eyes, he beholds distinctly, clearly, and at ease, all those several objects
that with so much labor and time he took but a mistakinge survey of before.

4. The fourth consideration shall be, that after the first instant wherein the
soul is separated from the body, she is then in her nature no longer subject
or liable to any new impression mutatio^ or change whatsoever. For that which
should cause any such effect, must be either a material or a spiritual agent:
But a material one cannot work upon it, for that requires quantity in the
patient, whereby it may be applied unto it to exercise its operation upon it:
Nor ca^ any spiritual age^t cause any succession of new alteration; But all
that spirits work one upon another is done at once and at one instant: which
we shall discern the clearer by examining the reason why there is succession
and time taken up in the alteratio^s that are wrought amongst material things,
for in them, by reason of their quantity that causes an extention and distance
of the parts, the agent, allthough it have never so much disposition and
efficacy to work, must have his several parts applied to the several parts
of the patient by local motion; which requires time for the performance
thereof. And besides, even in the agent it self, the grossness and
heaviness of the matter gives an allay and is a clogge to the actiuity of the
form, and as it were pulls it back whiles it is in action. But this is not
so in spiritual substances, and therefore we may conclude that among them in
the same instant that the agent is disposed to work, the action is performed,
for on his part there is nothing to retarde it, nor is there required any
local motion which should take up time; and likewise by the same reason, in
the very instant that the patient is disposed to receive any impression, it is
wrought in it: And thus, allthough there were never so many agents, and every
one of them to perform never so many actions, they would be all done, and
ended in one and the same instant.

5. The next consideration shall be, that those persons who in this world had
strong and predominant affections to sensible and material objects; and dyed
in that state; shall be eternally miserable in the next, for by what we have
said, it appears that those affections will eternally remain in the soul;
and that after the separation of it from the body, they can never be blotted
out of it, or changed; And the affections of a separated soul are much more
ardent and vehement then whiles it is in the body. But it is impossible they
should ever attain in that state to the fruitio^ of what they so violently
covet and love, and yet for its sake they neglect all other goods whatsoever
that they might have, whose beauty and excellency, notwithstanding they plainly
discern: they cannot choose therefore but execrate themselves for their fondly
misplaced (yet the^ eternally necessary) affecctions, and pine away (if so I
may say) with perpetual anguish and despair of what they so impatiently, and
enragedly desire and ueuer can obtain.

6. The sixth consideration shall be, that to be happy in the next life, one
must not settle their predominant affections upon any creature whatsoever, or
any good that we can naturally attain to the knowledge of in this life. For
what natural good soever we love or enjoy here, we must by death be divorced
from, and (as we have said before) that separation will cause perpetual
sorrow, because the affections remain unchangeable. And allthough we should
place our felicity in natural knowledge or any other intellectual good
whatsoever, yet that cannot satisfy the desires and fill the capacity of the
soul, though it be never so perfectly enjoyed: for they are infinite; and this
can be collected but out of particular objects (for the whole created universe
is but so) and therefore they hold on proportion together; but the soul haueing
nothing else to fill it withal, allthough it should not be tormented with the
former mentioned corrosiues of preposterous affections, yet it cannot be at
rest and quiet, and the thirst of it satisfied by that dropp of water in
comparison of the vehement ardor of it.

And thus it follows, that either man was not created for a determinate end,
and for a state convenient for his nature, and able to satisfy the original
appetences of his soul; or at the least, no man can by natural means arrive
to the end and period of happiness.

7. But now to proceed in the pursuance of this method of reasoning, and to
follow hence forward the conduct of a supernatural guide, since nature
quitteth us here, haueing lead us on as long as she was able to see; we may in
the seventh place consider that God when he created man did not assign him to
remain in the state of pure nature, but did out of his goodness and
liberality confer something upon him that exceeded the sphere of his nature.
For else, the first part of the preceedent consequence would follow; which were
not only impious, but absurd to say, to whosoever considers the infinite
goodness, wisdom and omnipotency of God. For as heat being essential to
fire, cannot but produce heat in whatsoever it application unto; so God being
in his own essence goodness it self, cannot chose but do unto whatsoever
proceeds from him, all that good which the nature of it is capable of;
(whether by natural or supernatural means) and his wisdom can readily
contriue the means to bring that to pass which his goodness disposes him to
do; And his omnipotency as easily acts what his other two attributes have
proiected; so that there wanting an infinite object to satisfy the infinite
capacity of the soul, and without which she must be eternally miserable; it
remains, that he who gave that capacity, must also afforde the object, and
assign means how to compass and gain it. All which we have already proved
is out of the reach of nature to discern: and therefore it follows of
consequence, that the author of nature must endowe man with some supernatural
gifts, if he be in a fit disposition to receive them which may bring him to
the supernatural end he was created for.

8 Our eight conclusion shall be that of these supernatural gifts, the first
and the ground and foundation of all the rest, is faith. For we have already
determined that we cannot by any natural means attain to the knowledge of
any object that may render us completely happy in the next life; And yet such
knowledge must be had, to the end that we may direct our actions to gain the
fruition of that object. Therefore there is no way left to compass this, but by
the instructions and discipline of some Master whose goodness and knowledge we
can no ways doubt of; by which two perfections in him, we may be secure that
he nether can be deceived himself, nor will deceive us. Now the docctrine that
such a Master shall teach for such an end, we call faith.

9. In the ninth place we must determine that this Master must be God and man.
For first by our discourse upon natural principles, we have proved, that to
avoid misery in the next life, we must deny our senses the content and
satisfaction that they naturally desire in corporal things, and that we must
withdraw our affections from all material objects: And next we have collected
that the object which we must know and love to be happy, does exceed the reach
and view of any created understanding to discern: Therefore we may safely
conclude that this doctrine ought to be delivered unto us originally by God
himself. For after the first branch, which is of withdrawing our affections
from sensible goods; allthough out of natural principles that doctrine is to
be collected, yet that is not a sufficient means to settle mankind in
general, in the belief of it: For the discourse that proves it, is such an
abstracted one, as very few are capable of it, being that it requires both a
mature age to be able to reason so (before which time many dye) and likewise
strong and vigoroux powers of the understanding which we see more do want then
are endowed withal: And, besides, of those that have both years and capacity
to wielde such thoughts, there are so few that are not in a manner forced away
from such interior recollections by their particular vacations and the
natural necessities they are obliged unto; as to beat it out by themselves is
not a sufficient means to serve mankind in this case. And to think that those
few who haueing great parts, may with much labor have attained to the
knowledge thereof, should instruct others that are simpler and are taken up by
other employments and courses of life, were very irrational; since no man, be
he never so wise, is such but may be deceived; and then, how can it be expected
that another man should without sensible demonstration believe his single word
in a matter so contrary to sense, and wherein he must forgo so great
contentments and present vtility?

And for the other branch, which is in the instructing mankind concerning the
right object that he is to know and love to be happy, that is altogether out
of the reach of any man whatsoever by himself to discover; and therefore much
less can he in his own name instruct others therein: And if any man should go
about to do so, and to introduce a new doctrine of faith not formerly heard
of, drawing the arguments for confirmation thereof only out of his own
ratiocination and discourse; that alone, were enough to convince him of
falsehoode; since he should thereby undertake to know what were impossible for
him of himself to attain to the knowledge of.

Therefore it is necessary that the author of the doctrine we must believe, the
instructor of the actions we must perform; and the promiser of the happiness
we may hope for, be God himself; who only knows of himself what is said
in matters of these natures, and who only is nether liable to be deceived, nor
can deceive others; as being the prime verity it self.

But because the weakness of our intellectual nature is such, whiles we
remain here in our earthly habitations, imprisoned in our houses of clay, as
we cannot lift up our heavy and drowsy eyes, and steddily fix our dim sight
upon the dazeling and indeed invisible Deity, nor entertain an immediate
communication with him (like the children of Israel, who desired that Moses,
not God might speak unto them) it was necessary that God himself should
descend to some corporal substance that might be more familiar and less
dazeling unto us; And none was so convenient as humane nature, to the end that
he might not only converse freely and familiarly with us, and so in a gentle
and a sweet manner teach us what we should do; but also preach unto us by his
example, and himself be our leader in the way that he instructed us to take.
The conclusion then of this discourse, is, that it was necessary, Christ, God
and man, should come into the world to teach us what to believe and what to do.

10. The tenth conclusion shall be, that those unto whom Christ did immediately
preach this faith, and unto whom he gave commission to preach it unto others
and spread it through the world, after he ascended to heaven, ought to be
believed as firmly as he himself. The reason of this assertion is, that their
doctrine, though it be delivered by secondary mouths, yet it proceeds from
the same fountain: which is God himself, that is the prime verity, and cannot
deceive, nor be deceived. But all the difficulty here in is, to know who had
this immediate commission from Christ, and by what seal we should discern it
to have bin no forged one. The solution of this arises out of the same
argument which proves that Christ himself was God, and that the doctrine he
taught was true and divine; which is, the miracles and works he did, exceeding
the power of nature, and that could be effected by none but by God hmiselfe:
for he being truth it self, cannot by any action immediately proceeding from
him, witness and confirm a falsehoode: In like manner the Apostles doing such
admirable works and miracles as nether by nature nor by art magic could be
brought to pass, that must necessarily infer God himself cooperated with
them to justify what they said; it is evident that their doctrine (which was
not their own, but received from Christ) must be true and Divine.

11. Te eleauenth conclusion shall be, that this faith thus taught by Christ
and propagated by the Apostles and necessary to mankind to believe (as well
that part of it, which is written, as the whole which is not) depends
intrinsecally upon the testimony of the Catholic Church; which is ordained to
conserve and deliver it from age to age. (By which Catholic Church, I mean
the congregation of the faithful that is spread through-out the whole world)
for we have proved before, that the way to the true faith ought to be open and
plain to all men, of all abilities, and in all ages, that have a desire to
embrace it: and this cannot be but either by the immediate preaching of Christ;
or else by the information (either in writing or by word of mouth) of them that
learned it from him, and their delivering it over to others, and so from hand
to hand until any particular time you will pitch upon. But from Christ's own
mouth, none could have it but those who lived in the age when he did, therefore
there remains no other means to have it derived down to after; ages then by
this delivery over from hand to hand of the whole congregation of fathers or
elders dispersed throughout the world, to the whole congregation of sons or
youngers; which course of deducing faith from Christ we call tradition, so that
this conclusion proves that the Church is the conseruer both of the whole
doctrine of faith necessary for salvation, and likewise of the divine writ
dictated by the Holy Ghost, and written by the Prophets, Evangelists and
Apostles, which we are also bound to believe. And the same assent that we are
to give to the truth of Scriptures (that is to say, that the Scriptures we have
are true Scriptures) the very same we are to give to other articles of faith
proposed unto us by the Church: for they alike depend of the same authority;
which is the veracity of the Church proposing and delivering the^ unto us to be
believed. And we may as well doubt that the Church has corrupted the
Scriptures, as that she has corrupted any article of faith.

12. The twelueth conclusion shall be that into the Catholic Church noe false
doctrine in any age can be admitted or creep in, that is to say, no false
proposition whatsoever can ever be received and embraced by the Catholic
Church as a proposition of faith. For whatsoever the Church believes as a
proposition of faith, is upon this ground, that Christ taught it as such unto
the Church he planted himself, and so it left it in trust to be by it
delivered over to the next age. And the reason why the present Church belieueth
any proposition to be of faith, is because the immediate preceding Church, of
the age before, delivered it as such. And so you may drive it on from age to
age until you come to the Apostles and Christ. Therefore to have any false
proposition of faith admitted into the Church in any age, does Suppose that all
they of that age must unanimously conspire to deceive their children and
youngers, telling them that they were taught by their fathers to believe, as
of faith, some proposition which indeed they were not. Which being impossible
(as it will evidently appear to any prudent person that shall reasonably
ponder the matter) that so many men spread throughout the whole world, so
different in their particular interests and ends, and of such various
dispositions and natures, should all agree together in the forgery of any
precise lie; it is impossible that any false doctrine should creep into the
Church.

But because the force of this argument may peradventure not appear at the
first sight to your Ladyshipp, that happily has not had much occasion to make
deep reflection upon the certainty that must needs be in the asseueration of
any history of matter of fact subject to the sense, which shall be made by a
great company of men so distant from one another, and of such different
interests and affections as they cannot conspire together in the forgery of a
falsehood; But that you may happily think, since any one man is liable to be
deceived, or out of some indirect end may be iuduced to deceive another, it is
also possible that a whole multitude of men (be it never so great) consisting
of particular men, may also deceive or be deceived: I will therefore for a
further declaration of this matter, propose for the thirteenth Conclusion, that
faith thus delivered, is absolutely more certain and infallible then any
natural science whatsoever. And yet sciences are so certain (I mean such as
depend of experience and demonstration) as he were not a rational man that
should refuse his assent unto them: And consequently he would incur the like
ce^sure that should not yield crede^ce to faith, in this manner proposed unto
him. In the proof of this conclusion I must use two words appropriated to
philosophy (to wit matter and form) which is contrary to my intention at the
first, which was to abstain from all terms of artificial learning, and make
only a familiar discourse that should require no preceedent help of study,
but only a clear and strong judgment (such as yours is) to weigh the
strength of the reason: Butt I am the less srcupulous to avoid these words,
because I know your La: understands what is meaned by them; and they have
often occurred in our discourses. To come then to the examination of this
co^clusio^, I say, that faith depends on these two propositions; first, that
whatsoever God says is true; Next, that God said this (whatsoever it be) that
is delivered thus by the tradition of the Church. For the former of these
assertions, there is noe doubt made by any side; since all agree that God being
the prime verity, whatsoever proceeds immediately from him must necessarily be
more infallible then any collections made from creatures either by experience or
ratiocination of men. The second assertion I shall also prove to be more
infallible then any such collections; in this manner. Among material things,
that are subject to time and place, and are here in the sphere of contraries,
and of action and passion, although the laws that govern them are in the
general certain (else no science could be acquired of them) yet in the
particular they are subject to contingency and defection from those laws;
which contingency does proceed from the resistance of the matter, and the
contagion and leprosy (if so I may say) that the matter infecteth the form
withal; which, were it not for that, would always constantly work the same
effect in all ocasions: and according as the form has in particular more or
less predominance over the matter, the contingency and defect in them from the
true nature of that body considered in his perfection, is the greater or the
lesser. Let us illustrate this by an example: According to the ordinary
doctrine of Philosophers in the Schools, we collect by many particular
experiences, that the nature of fire proceedinge from the form of it, is to
ascend; and of them we frame a general doctrine that fire is the lightest of
all the elements, and that his natural place is above them all: yet we see
that when the form of fire is introduced into gross and terrestrial matter,
it is wrested from his own natural inclination, and is forced, in steed of
ascendind, then to descend; as when wood, iron, earthcoale, and such other
terrestrial matter is set on fire: And it is more or less violented from his
natural place, according as the subject it resideth in, has more or less
power over it, and is more or less material: for it shows more of his
leuity and natural prope^sion to ascend, when it sets an oily, or ay ery
substance on fire and breaks up in flames, the^ when meeting with a more
material and terrestrial substance, as wood, it turns it into a coal. Now
to apply this to our purpose, I say, that of all forms whatsoever that are
joined to matter, the noblest and most elevated above the foeculency of matter,
is the soul of man: for it is not only the form of the noblest material
creature that is; but besides that, it is so full of efficacy as it even
ouerfloweth the capacity of matter, which not being able to imbibe (as I may
say) and take it up all, it has a particular subsistence belonging to it
self; from whence Philosophers prove the immortality of it. Therefore we may
safely conclude that mankind, in the original appetences and natural desires
of his soul, is less subject to contingency, and more secure from having his
nature corrupted and perverted from his due course, then any other material
creature whatsoever is in the performance of those actions that proceed from
the actiuity of his form; and so consequently, being considered in general,
proceeds most certainly and infallibly to the pursuance thereof; and it is
impossible it should fall of from its own nature, and, suffer that to be
extinguished in it; although in some particulars, by the immersion in matter
and the terrene habitation it dwells in, some soul may be drawn or rather
wrested to a contrary byas unto that which originally nature implanted in it.
Now the primary original natural appetence of man's soul, is the love of
truth; which it vehemently desires, and is always unquiet and arde^t in the
search of it upon what occasion soever, and is never appeased and at ease,
until she have found it out; which she noe sooner has done, but the violence
she was in is calmed; she is contented; and she setleth her self to repose, as
having arrived to her center and natural place of rest; wherein she continues
enjoying the purchase she has made, until some new occasion of disquisision
stir her up again; in which she uses the same industry and eagernes as
before. And thus we plainly see that the acquisition of truth is that which
the soul in every action naturally aymeth at, as fire does to ascend; and
detesteth falsehood, as flames suffer violence to be reuerberated downwards.
Therefore, allthough any particular man may have his senses or fantasy so
depraved as to take imperfect and maimed impressions of outward objects; or the
powers of his understanding so weak as to make preposterous and disorderly
collections out of them; or his judgment so misguided by preoccupation of any
affection or particular end, as he may in himself be deceived, and feed his
soul with falsehood in steed of truth; or else, that sinister respects and
interests, or sordide apprehensions of commodity to himself, meeting with a
soul so disposed and wrought upon by the sensual passions tyrannising over
it, as to cause him to swallow those baytes, may make him employ the faculties
of his understanding and the powers of his soul, contrary unto their natural
inclination, to the maintayning of a lie, and industriously to deceive others:
yet it is impossible that all mankind or such a multitude of men as contain in
them all the variety of dispositions and affections incident to the nature of
man, and that are dispersed throughout the world, so as they can have noe
communion together whereby they might infect one another, nor can have sinister
ends common alike to them all, which should inuit the^ to conspire together to
forge a falsehood: it is impossible (I say) that such a company of men should
so degenerate from their own nature (which is to love truth) as they should of
themselves invent a lie (and that in so important a matter as faith is) and
concur to deceive the world of men that should come after them in things of
such nature, as their deceit must of necessity damn for all eternity both
themselves and all them that shall receive that lie from them, and take it upon
their credit: without which unanimous conspiracy of one whole age of men
throughout all the world, we proved in our last conclusion that no false
proposition could be admitted into the Church as an article of faith. In a
word, this general defection of all makinde from truth, is more impossible
then that all one entire element or any primigeniall nature should absolutely
perish or loose its original propriety; as for all the fire in the world to
be corrupted and forsake his heat and leuity, and so consequently to have noe
more fire in nature: all which follows of what is said above. And thus I
conceive I have made good the assertion that has begotten all this discourse
upon the thirtee^th head; which is that faith conserved in the Catholic
Church, and delivered by perpetual succession and general tradition, is more
certain and more infallible then any natural science whatsoever: for natural
sciences being grounded upon the indefectibility of the natures of those things
from whence those sciences are collected; and faith depending upon the
indefectibility of humane nature, which is infinitely more noble then they, and
whose form is elevated beyond the reach of matter (whereas theirs is
comprehended and shutt up within the womb of matter and which is indeed the
end and period of all their natures, and of all the whole material world) It
follows of consequence that faith must be less subject to contingency, and
less liable to error then natural sciences are. And they being in universal
infallible and certain; faith must likewise be so too; and more if more may be.

But this is not enough. our disquisition must not rest here: We must not
content ourselves in this divine affair and supernatural doctrine with a
certitude depending only upon natural causes. The wisdom of God
proportioneth out congruent means to bring on every thing to their proper end;
and according to the nobility of the effect that he will have produced, he
ordains equivalent noble causes. Therefore, man's obtaining beatitude being
the highest end that any creature can arrive unto, and altogether
supernatural; it requires supernatural causes to bring us to that end, and a
supernatural infallibility to secure us in that journey. We must not only
have a supernatural way to travel in (which is faith) but also a
supernatural assurance of the right way, unto the discovery of which, all that
we have already said, does necessarily co^duce; for Gods providence that
disposes all things sweetly, will not in any general affair introduce into
the material world any supernatural effect, until the natural causes be
first disposed fittingly to cooperate on their parts; and then he never
fails of his. As for example, when a natural creature is to be produced into
being, the father and mother must both concur in contributing all that is in
their power to the generation of a child; and yet we are sure the soul to be
produced has no dependa^ce of them; yet notwithstanding, without their
precedent action no new soul would be: But when the matter is fittingly
disposed in the mothers womb, he never misseth creating of a soul in that
body; which is as noble an effect, and as much requiring the omnipotency of
God, as the creating of nothing all the material world; and yet we may say
that the matter, when it is arrived to its last disposition for the reception
of such a form, may in a manner claim that miraculous action depending of his
omnipotency; since for mankind he created the rest of the material world, and
therefore there ought to be as certain and necessary causes for the production
of man, as there are for the production of other material things, which we see
do seldom m^sse in any when the matter is fitly disposed for the reception of
their several forms. And so in like manner we may rationally conclude, that
in this high and supernatural business of delivering over from hand to hand a
supernatural doctrine to bring mankind to the end it was created for, he will
first have all the natural causes fittingly disposed for the secure and
infallible performance of that work: and then, that he will add and infuse
into them some supernatural gift whereby to give them yet further a
supernatural assurance and infallibility; which they may with an humble
confidence in his unlimited goodesse, expect and claim at his divine hand,
when they are reduced to that state as is convenient for the reception of such
a supernatural gift.

14. Our fourteenth conclusion therefore shall be that God has given to his
Church thus composed, the holy Ghost, to confirm it in the true faith, and to
preserve it from error, and to Illuminate the understanding of it in right
discerning the true sense of those Misteryes of faith that are committed to the
custody of it, and to work supernatural effects of devotion and sanctity in
that Church. And this I prove thus, Considering that the doctrine of Christ is
practical and aymeth at the working of an effect, which is the reduction of
mankind to beatitude: and that mankind comprehends not only those that
lived in that age, when he preached, but also all others that ever were since,
or shall be till the end of the world: It is apparent that to accomplish that
end, it was necessary Christ should so effectually imprint his doctrine in
their hearts whom he delivered it unto, as it might upon all occasions and at
all times infallibly express it self in action, and in the delivery of it
over from hand to hand, should in virtue and strength of the first operation,
produce ever after like effects in all others. Now to have this compleately
performed, it was to be done both by exterior and by interior means;
proportionable to the senses without, and to the soul within. The outward
means were the miracles that he wrought, of which himself says, if I had
not wrought those works that no man else ever did, they were not guilty of
sin, but now, they have no excuse: (or to this purpose) and he promissed the
Apostles they should do greater then those. And that miracles are the proper
instruments to plant a new doctrine and faith withal, the Apostle witnesses
when he says that miracles are wrought for the unfaithful not for the
faithful, and God himself told Moses that he would once do some prodigy in
his favor that the people might for ever after believe what he said to them.
But it is manifest by the fall of the Apostles themselves, that only this
exterior means of miracles is not sufficient to engrafte supernatural faith
deep enough in men's hearts, when as they upon Christ's Passion, not only for
fear, through humane frailty, denied their master, but had even the very
conceit and belief of his doctrine exiled out of their hearts and
understanding, notwithstanding all the miracles they had seen him work in
almost 4. years time they continually co^uersed with him: which appears
plainly by the discourse of the disciples going to Emaus, when they said we
hoped, etc. And expressed their sadness for the contrary success to their
expectation; and by saint Thomas his saying that he would not believe his
resurrection unless he saw him and pnt his fingers into his wounds etc. And
by the rest of the Apostles that were so long before they would believe his
resurrection, as having given over the thought of his divinity, and after his
death considered him but as a pure man like other me^. Therefore it was
necessary that some inward light should be given them, so clear, and so
strong, and so powerful, as the senses should not be able to prevail against
it, but that it should onerflowingly possess and fill all their understandings
and their souls, and make them break out in exterior actions correspondent
to the spirit that steered them within. And the reason is evident: for whiles
on the one side the senses discern, apparently, miracles wrought in
confirmation of a doctrine; and on the other side, the same senses do stiffly
contradict the very possibility of the doctrine which those miracles testifye;
the soul within, having no assistance beyond the natural powers she has
belonging originally unto her, is in great debate and anxiety which way to give
her assent; and though reason do prevail to give it to the party of the
present miracles, yet it is with great timidity. But if it happen that the
course of those miracles be stopped; the^ the particular seeming impossibilies
of the proposed faith remaining always alike lively in their apprehension, and
the miracles wrought to confirm it residing but in the memory, and the
representatio^s of them wearing out daily more and more, and the present senses
and fantasy growing proportionably stonger and stronger, and withal obiecting
continually new doubts about the reality of those miracles, it cannot be
expected otherwise but that the assent of the soul should range it self on
the side of the impossibilityes appearing to the present senses, and renounce
the doctrine formerly confirmed by miracles, unless some inward and
supernatural light be given her to disperse all the mistes that the senses
raise against the truth of the doctrine. Now the infusion of this light and
fervor, we call the giving of the holy Ghost, which Christ himself
foreknowing how necessary it was, promised them, assuring the^ that he would
procure his father to send them the Holy Ghost, the spirit of truth, that
should for ever remain among them, and within them, and suggest unto their
memory and instruct them in the right understanding of the faith he had
preached unto them. And this was prophesied long before, of the state of the
law of grace by Hieremy, whose authority S. Paul brings to prove that the
law of the Gospel was to be written by the holy Ghost in men's hearts and in
their minds, and accordingly, he calls the faithful of the Corynthians, the
faith of Christ not written with ink, but with the spirit of God; nor graven
in stony tables, but in the fleshy ones of their hearts. And in performance of
this prophesy and of Christ's promise, the history tells us that on the tenth
day after the ascension of Christ, when all his disciples (who were then all
his Church, and were to preach and deliver it to all the world) were assembled
together, the holy Ghost was given the^; and that, in so full a measure, as
they not only were confirmed so perfectly in their faith as they never after
admitted the least vacillation therein, but they immediately, casting away all
other desires and thoughts, were inflamed with admirable love of God, and broke
out into his praises, and into a vehement ardor of teaching and converting
others; and when, by reason of that zeal of theirs, any thing happened to them
contrary to flesh and blood, and humane nature (as persecutions, ignominies,
corporal punishments, and even death it self) they not only not shunned it,
as before, but greedily rann to meet and embrace it, and ioyed, and gloryed in
it: all which were effects of the holy Ghost residing in them, and filling
their minds, and gouuerning their souls. Where upon, by the way we may note,
that in what Church soever we find not a state of life for sanctity and near
union with God, and contempt of wordly and transitory things, raised above the
pitch of nature and morality, we may conclude the holy Ghost inhabiteth not
there: for every agent produces effects proportionable to the dignity of it,
and the excellency of any cause, shines eminently in the nobleness of its
effects. Now that this gift of the holy Ghost is to remain with the Church as
long as the Church remains, to illuminate it with the spirit of truth, and to
give it a supernatural and divine unction, will appear manifestly upon
consideration of the cause why the holy Ghost was to be given at the first,
which remains always the same, and therefore the same effect must always
follow: and accordingly, Christ promised his Church upon his asce^ding into
heaven, that he would always ramaine with them until the end of the world, to
wit, by this holy spirit; for he was then at the point of withdrawing his
corporal presence from them.

15. Our next conclusion shall be that this Church or congregation of men
spread over the world, co^seruing and delivering the faith of Christ from hand
to hand, is even in its own nature perpetual in time, and cannot fail as
long as mankind remains in the world. This needs noe further proof then
that which we have already made; which is derived from the necessity of
supernatural faith to bring mankind to the end it was created for, and that
there is no means to deliver this faith to mankind in the ages after Christ,
but by the tradition of the Church; and therefore as long as mankind lasts,
this means must be continued. Yet in this way of reasoning that I use, we are
to examine our conclusions as well by the genuine and orderly causes that beget
them, and by their own particular principles, as to assent unto them for the
necessity that we see in them in regard of the end that they are referred
unto: And when we have retriued those, and evidently discerned their force, it
gives an admirable content and satisfaction to the understanding. Thus then:
as Philosophers conclude that it is impossible any whole species or kind of
beasts should ever be utterly exterminated and destroyed, that is diffused up
and down over the whole face of the earth, because the amplitude of the
universe is greater then the variety of causes can be from which such a
general and entire corruption must proceed: In like manner we may confidently
conclude, that it is impossible any depraved affections should so universally
prevail, and so absolutely reign in men's minds throughout the whole world, as
would be requisite to extirpate and root out a doctrine universally spread
over it all, that was at the first taught and confirmed with such s^ales of
truth as the miracles that Christ and the Apostles wrought, that in it self is
so pure and agreeable to the seeds that every man finds sowed, even by
nature, in his own soul; that works such admirable effects as the
reformation of manners in mankind; that withdraws men's affections from humane
and wordly contentments, and carries them with a sweet violence to
intellectual objects, and to hopes of immortality and happiness in another
life; that prescribes laws for happy living, even in this world, to all men
of what condition soever, either public or private, as working a moderation in
men's affections to the commodities and goods of this life, which else in nature
is apt to blind men's minds, and is the cause of all michiefes and evils; and
lastly, that is delivered over from hand to hand, from worlds of fathers to
worlds of sons, with such care and exactness as greater cannot be imagined,
and as is requisite to the importance of that affair; which is infinitely
beyond all others, as on which the salvation and damnation of mankind wholly
depends. Now, unto these rational considerations let us add the promise
which Christ made to his Church, that the gates of hell should not prevail
against it; and I think we have sufficiently maintained that the Church of
Christ in which the true doctrine of Christ is conserved, can never fail, but
must infallibly continue until the worlds end. Thus having proved, that a
supernatural doctrine is necessary to bring mankind to beatitude; that Christ
taught this doctrine; that from him the Churh received it, and is the sacrary
in which it is co^serued; that this Church cannot err in the tradition of this
doctrine, that besides the infallibility of it, this Church is perpetual. It
remains now that we close up this discourse by applying all these premises
unto the question in hand; which is, where we shall find out this infallible
Church, that by it we may gain the knowledge of the true faith of Christ,
whereby we are to be saved,

16. For this end our sixteenth and last conclusion shall be, that the
congregation of men spread over the world, joining in communion with the Church
of Rome, is the true Catholic Church in which is conserved and taught the true
saving faith of Christ.

The truth of this conclusion will without bringing any new proofs appear
evidently by reflecting upon what we have said, and only examining whether
the Roman Church be such a one as we have determined the true Church of Christ
must be; or whether the notes which me may infer out of our discourse to
belong inseparably to the true Church, may not rather with more reason be
acknowledged of some other then of that in communion with the sea of Rome? this
point after these grounds laid, requires no very subtle disquisition, but
is discernable even by the weakest sights: and therefore this way of arguing
appears to me most satisfactory and contentfull, when taking the whole body
of the question into survey; and beginning with the first and remotest
considerations of it, we drive the difficulties still before us; and pursuing
of them orderly, at every step we establish a solid principle, and so become
secure of the truth and certainty of all we leave behind us; which course,
although it may at the first sight appear to be a great way about, and looking
but superficially upon the matter we may seem to meet with difficulties which
concern not our question; yet in the effect we shall perceive it is the most
summary method of handling any controversy; and the only means to be secured
of the truth of what we conclude, and that will recompense the precedent
difficulties by making the conclusion (which is the knotte of the affayre)
plain, easy, and open. I say then first that unity of doctrine in matters of
faith is inseparable from the Roman Church, and can never be found in any
other: it only, having a precise and determinate rule of faith. For it has
believed in every age, all that has bin plainly and positiuely taught unto it
by their fathers as the doctrine of faith derived from Christ; and admits
noe other article whatsoever as an article of faith. Whereas on the other side,
all other Christian Churches among us that pretend reformation, haueing no
certain and common rule of faith, but every particular man governing himself
in this matter by the collections of his own brain, and by his own private
understanding and interpretation of Scripture (which only he acknowledges as
the entire rule of faith) it must consequently follow, that according to the
variety of their tempers and judgments, there must be a variety and difference
of their opinions and beliefes; which difference of temper happening for the
most part between every two men that are, it likewise follows scarce any two
should in all particulars of their opinions agree together. And accordingly we
see by experience, that scarce any two authors, out of the Roman Church, that
have written of matters of faith have agreed in their tenets, but rather have
dissented in fundamental doctrine, and have inueighed against one another in
their writings with great vehemence and bitterness. Whereas on the other side,
the Doctors of the Roman Church in all times, in all places, and of all
tempers have agreed unanimously in all matters of faith; although in the mean
time, several of them have, in diverse other points great debates against one
another, and pursue them with much sharpness: which strongly confirms the
ground upon which we frame this observation.

But to insist a little further upon this material and important
consideration; it is evident that the proceeding of the reformers opens the
gate to all dissension, schism, irreuerence, pride of understanding, heresy,
and ruin of Christian religion: for to justify the new births of their
rebellions brains, the first stroke of their pen must be to lay a taint of
ignorance and error upon the whole current of Ancient fathers and Doctors of
the Church, and general Counsels, and to blast their authority which is so
precisely contrary to their doctrine; whose names and records ought to be
sacred with posterity. Which when they have done; to settle a constant and like
belief in all men, they give noe general and certain rule; but leaving every
man to the Dictamens of his own private judgment, according to the several
tempers and circumstances (as we said before) that sway every single man in
particular, there must result (which we see by experience) as great a variety
of opinions as those are different. And lastly since they quarrel at
Catholics belief in those points where they differ from them, because they
captiuate their understandings with reverence to what the Church proposes and
teaches, and thereby admit into their belief articles which may seem absurd
to common sense; they may as well with presumptuous hands, graspe at and seek
to pluck up, the very fundations of Christian religion; as namely the doctrine
of the Trinity, and of the incarnation of Christ, and of the resurrection and
state of life of the future world: since there are greater seeming
contradictions in them (especially in the two first) then in those misteryes
the reformers cavil at.

In the next place we may consider that as infallibility is pretended by the
Roman Church alone, so it is apparently entayled upon it: for we have proved
that no means or circumsta^ce, either moral, natural or supernatural, is
wanting in it to begett infallibility in matters of faith. Whereas on the other
side, from the reformers own position we infer by consequence that their
doctrine cannot be hoped (even by themselves) to be infallible; and therefore
they that shall submiit their understanding to their conduct, though they
believe without controversy all they say, must needs (even by reason of what
is taught them) floate always in a great deal of incertitude and anxious
apprehension and fear of error. For they looking upon the Church, but with
pure humane considerations as an ordinary company of men, will have it liable
to mistaking according to the natural imbecility of men's wits and
understandings, and of humane passions, and negligence and other such defects
and weaknesses which every man is by nature subject unto: Against which they
produce no antidote to preserve and secure themselves from the infectio^ and
taint they lay upon the Church. For, if they will have the conferences of
several passages of Scripture to be that which must give light in the several
co^trouerted obscurities; what eminency have these few late reformers shown,
other in knowledge of tongues, insight into antiquity, profoundnesse in
sciences, and perfection and sanctity of life, which has not shined admirably
more (not to tax them here of the contrary) in multitudes of the adverse
party? And none will deny but these are the likelyest means to gain a right
intelligence of the true and deep sense of Scriptures. And besides, we may
observe that the reason why they deny the several articles wherein they differ
from the Catholic Church, is because it teaches a doctrine which is
repugnant to sense and of hard digestion to Philosophy; both which are
vncompetent judges of divine and supernatural truths: And whosoever steereth
by their compass, cannot hope for infalliblity in a matter that transcendeth
their reach.

Thirdly we may consider that the universality of the Church in regard of
place (which is necessary to the end that all mankind may have sufficient
means to gain knowledge of the true faith) can be attributed to none but to
the Roman Catholic Church; which only is diffused throughout the whole
world; whereas all others are circled in with narrow limits of particular
provinces; And even within them, the professors scarce agree among themselves
in any point of doctrine but in opposing the Roman Church.

And yet further; besides this want of universality in regard of place; the
Religion taught by the reformers, has yet a greater restriction then that: for
even in its own nature, it is not for all sorts of persons and for all
capacities: whereas the true saueing faith to bring men to beatitude ought to
be obuious to all mankind, and open as well to the simple as to the learned.
For since they lay the Scriptures as the first and highest principle, from
whence they deduce all that ought to be believed; And that in all arts and
sciences the primary and fundamental principles thereof ought to be thoroughly
known by the^ that aspire to the perfect knowledge of those sciences; it
follows that one must have an exact knowledge of the learned tongues to
examine punctually the true sense of the Scriptures; and that one must be
perfectly versed in logic to be able to reason solidly, and to deduce true
conseque^ces from certain principles (for want of which, we find by experience
that great controversies arise daily among the learned men; which would not
be, if the force of consequences were of their own nature easily discernable)
and one must be thoroughly skilled in natural philosophy and Metaphysickes,
since unto appearing contradictions in subjects of those sciences, they reduce
most of their arguments against the supernatural truths that Catholics
believe. And lastly one must be endowed with an excellent judgment and strong
natural wit, to be able to wield and make good use of these weapons; without
which they would but advance him the faster to ruin and pernicious error. With
which excellencyes, how few are there in the world fairly adorned?

Fourthly, it is evident that the Roman Catholic Church only has had a
constant and uninterrupted succession of Pastors and Doctors, and tradition of
doctrine from age to age; which we have established as the only means to
derive down the true faith from Christ. Whereas it is apparent all others have
had late beginnings from unworthy causes: And yet, even in this little while,
have not been able to maintain themselves for one age throughout (or scarce
for any considerable part of an age) in one tenor of doctrine, or form of
Ecclesiastical government. Lastly we may consider how the effect of the holy
Ghost his inhabiting in the Church, in regard of manners, making the hearts of
men his living temples, shines eminently in the Catholic Church, and is not
so much as to be suspected in any other whatsoever. For where this holy spirit
reigns, it gives a burning love of God (as we have touched before) and a
vehement desire of approaching unto him as near as may be: Now, the soul of
man, moves toward God not by corporeal steps and progressions, but by
intellectual actions; the highest of which, are mental prayer and
conte^plation; in which exercices, a man shall advance the more, by how much he
is the more sequestered from the thought and care of any wordly affairs, and
has his passions quieted within him, and is abstracted from communication with
material objects, and is untied from humane interests, and (according to the
counsels of Christ in the Gospel) has cast off all solicitude of the
future, and remitteth himself wholly to the providence of God, living in the
world as though he were not in it, wholly intent to conte^plation when the
inferior part of Charity calls him not down to comply with the necessity of
his Neighbors. This form of life we see continually practiced in the
Catholic Church by multitudes of persons of both sexes, that through extreme
desire of approaching as near unto God as this life will permit, do banish
themselves from all their friends, kindred, and what else in the world was
naturally dearest unto the^; and either retire into extreme solitudes, or shutt
themselves up for ever within the narrow limits of a straight Monastery and
little cell; where having renounced all the interest and propriety in the goods
of this world, and using no more of them then is necessary for the poor
sustenance of their exhausted bodies (which they mortify with great
abstinences, watchings and other austerityes, that they may bring them into
subjection; and root out, as much as may be, the very fuel of concupiscence
and passions) and having of their own accord barred themselves of all
propriety of disposing of themselves in any action, and renounced even the
freedom of their will; and thus in sum, having taken an eternal farewell of
all the joys and delights that this world can afford, and that carnal me^
would be so loath to forgo for any little while; yet by the internal joys
that they find in their prayer and co^templation (unto which all these actions
of retrenchment from superfluities, or outward solaces, do serve as a ladder
to ascend unto the topp of it) they live so happily, and cheerfully, and with
such tranquillity of mind, and upon occasions say so much of the ouerflowings
of their bliss, as it is apparent they enjoy there the hundredfold that Christ
promised in this life. Nor can it be objected that men usually betake
themselves to this course of Religious life, upon being distempered by
melancholy, or for the ill success and trauerses they have had in affairs of
the world, or out of simplicity and weakness of understanding; since it is
evident that this Angelical form of living has ever been best practiced by
persons of the best composed and cheerfullest dispositions; and by multitudes
of such is and has been embraced; and that in the world ouerflowed with all
the blessings it could afford them; and were of strongest parts of
understanding and judgment; and were most eminent in learning. So that it is
apparent they had no other motive thereunto, but purely the love of God and
fervor of devotion: which being an effect of the holy Ghost residing in their
hearts; to his inspirations and admirable ways of working in those his
temples of flesh and blood, these extraordinary effects are to be imputed.
Whereas on the other side noe such examples or surpernaturall form of life,
are to be met withal in any other Church whatsoever: Rather, they disclaim
from them; and like men of this world (which is the expression that Christ
uses in the Gospel to design those that are not of his Church) not being
able to discern things of the spirit, but being blinded with the luster of
them, too great for their weak eyes; they neglect and disdain them, and
imagine that all Christian perfection consists in an ordinary humane moral
life: which is the uttermost periode that any among them seek to attain unto.
And therefore we may hence conclude that they have no interior worker among
them more sublime then their own humane discourses and judgments; and that
supernatural sa^ctity (an effect of the holy Ghost) is confined only to the
Catholic Church.

Besides; we may observe by daily experience, how those persons that addict
themselves to such an extraordinary way of life; do absolutely prove either the
best or the worst of mankind; the one excelling in admirable piety, fervor of
denotion, abstraction and sanctity of life, and some of them soaring up to a
pitch even above nature; the other abounding in all sorts of impiety,
wickedness and dissolution of manners, till at length their hearts become
even hardened against correction and all sense of spiritual things; whereas it
ordinarily happens that the most flagitious men among those who live in a
vulgar wordly estate of life, do upon occasions frequently receive notable
impressions from divine objects to the amendment and change of their dissolute
course. And this being a constant and certain effect noted at all times and in
all places, it must be attributed to a constant and powerful cause: which can
be noe other the^ the near approaching of those persons to the original
fontaine of sainctity and goodness; which being like a consuming fire, works
vehement effects in them, according to the disposition they are in, and to the
neerenes that they have unto that fire: so that as the sun beams (which are
the authors of life and foe cundity to all plants and vegetables) shinning upon
a tree that has taken soide roots in the earth, makes it budd, flourish, and
bear fruit, and on the other side, if it be weakly rooted, their heat and
operation upon that tree makes it the sooner to wither and die: And as the
fire sends an influence of heat into a pott of water that is symply applied
unto it, but if that pott be set in a vessel of snow or ice, and so be held
over the fire, it drives unto the center the cold of the snow formerly
diffused with out, and in a very short space turns that water into ice, which
else might have stayed there long enough without congealing: in like manner,
they who being rooted in charity, approach to that dinine sun, do flourish
and bring fourth excellent and ofttymes supernatural fruits of devotion,
feruor, and sanctitye; butt those who have depraved affections so inuironing
the roots of their hearts as that the soil of charity ca^nott introduce her
nourishing sap into them; and whose souls are compassed in with the ice of
sensuality and carnal cogitations; if they come within the beams of this holy
sun, or within the heat of this sanctifying fire, they do but wither a way
the sooner, and their hearts grow daily more and more to be ice, till at length
(like that of Pharao, amidst the wondrous works of the lord, happy to others)
they become miserable and stony.

And again we see that those who having addicted themselves wholly to such a
course of Seraphy call life, and that being always vehemently intent to the
love and contemplation of the prime verity, and that having no other object for
their actions or thoughts; do thereby (as we may reasonably conceive)
approach nearest to God allmighty and draw immediately from him (who is the
fonntaine of light and truth) strongest emanations and cleerest influences to
illustrate their understanding, and inflame their affections: those persons (I
say) have ever been most earnest in the maintenance of those points of the
Roman doctrine which are most repugnant to sense (as in particular, of that of
the real presence of Christ's body in the blessed Sacrement; unto which all
other Sacrements, and acts of faith and devotion, are reduced) and adore them
with greatest reverence, and are enflamed with feruentest devotion unto them.
And therefore we may conclude that this confidence, religiousnesse, and
fervor, proceeds from hence that these men, and such among them as cannot be
suspected for simplicity, ignorance, or sinister ends; are thus confirmed in
this faith, and are thus set on fire with this devotion more vigorously and
vehemently then ordinary secular men; by the immediate working and inspiration
of the holy Ghost; from whose streams it is likely they drink purer and
cleerer waters, and nearer the well head, then other men of a more worldly and
vulgar conversation. And it were not agreeable to the goodness of God to
permit those persons that most affectionatly seek him, and who for his sake,
out of pure devotion and desire of contemplating truth, do abridge themselves
of all other wordly contentme^ts, to have their understandings worse blinded
with false doctrine then other men that seek him more coldly and care less
for him; and to have their wills more depraved then theirs with erroneous and
false devotion, as of necessity it would follow theyrs were, if the doctrine
that the Catholic Church professes were not true, and the holy Ghost resided
not in it to work those effects. Now on the contrary part, let us make a
short inquiry whether it be probable that the late pretended reformers have
been illuminated by God in an extraordinary manner, to discover truth; which
they say has for many ages layen hidd. Surely if any such thing were, they
would have expressed in their manner of life by some extraordinary sanctity
and excellent actions, and supernatural wisdom, that extraordinary
communication which they would persuade us they had with the divinity. For as
by a radiant beam of light shining in at the chinke of a window, we know
assuredly, the sun beats upon it, although we see not his body; so
likewise there should have broken out from them some admirable and excellent
effect whereby we might rest confident that the divine sun illuminated
their understanding, and enflamed their will. Moses when he came down from
the mountain where he so long conuersed with God, expressed even by the
luster glittering from his face, that it was not an ordinary or natural light
which had shined unto him: the Apostles when they were replenished with the
holy Ghost received immediately the gift of tongues and a clear intelligence
of all the Scriptures; whereby they made clear unto the auditors the obscurest
passages of them; and continually wrought miracles: and all those that ever
since them have introduced the Gospel into any country where formerly it was
not received, have still had thyre commission auctorised by the same seals;
and shall our late particular Reformers be credited in their pretended
vocation, and in their new doctrine that shakes the very foundations of the
faith that has been by the whole Christian world for so many ages believed
and delivered over from hand to hand, when as nothing appears in them
supernatural and proceeding from a divine cause?

This Madame, is as much as I shall trouble your La: withal upon this
occasion: which indeed is much more then at the first I intended or could have
suspected my pen would have stolen from me. The substance of all which may be
summed up and reduced to this following short question; namely, whether in the
election of the faith whereby you hope to be saved, you will be guided by the
unanimous consent of the wisest, the learned, and the piousest men of the
whole world, that have been instructed in what they believe by men of the like
quality living in the age before them, and so from age to age until the
Apostles and Christ; and that in this manner have derived from that fountain,
both a perfect and full knowledge of all that ought to be believed, and
likewise a right understanding and interpretation of the Scriptures, as far as
concerns faith; (the true sense of which so far, is also delivered over by
the same tradition.) Or whether you will assent unto the new and wrested
interpretations of places of Scripture, made by late men that rely merely upon
their single judgment and wit (too slight a barcke to sail in through so
immense an Ocean) and whose chief leaders for humane respects and sinister
ends (not to say worse of them) made a desperate defection from the other maine
body; since which time; noe two of them have agreed in doctrine; and among whom
it is impossible your ladyshipps great judgment and strong understanding
should find any solid stay to repose securely upon, and to quiett all those
rational doubts that your perceing wit suggesteth unto you. And here, Madame,
I shall make an end; hae^ing sincerily, and as succinctly and plainly as I can
delivered you the chief considerations that in this affayre turned the scale
of the balance with me; which in good faith I have done with all the
simplicity and ingenuity that I can express my sense with; being not at all
warmed with any passion or partiality, nor raised out of my eue^ pitch and
temper with any spirit of disputation, or siding humor; (which few have avoided
upon this subject) but I have given you a true picture of my seriousest and
saddest thoughts and resolutions to my self in this most important business;
wherein you will believe I would take the greatest pains I was able, to be
sure not to be deceived. I have not sought to show wittiness or acuteness of
learning in the debating of these points; or have affected polished langage in
the committing them to paper; for this matter should not be handled for
oftentation but for use: and though peradventure if this discourse should fall
into the view of some learned man he may at the first sight set but a slight
value upon it; yett I persuade my self whosoever he be if he will ponder it
seriously and leasurely and with a like interior recollectio^ as I at the first
settled the grounds of it in my own soul, he will then find it touches the
life of the matter: and though I have not deliured my conceptions smoothly and
well, yett he will not think his time lost in reading them; and having
stronger parts then I, he will make cleerer use of them then I have done. This
I am sure of; that allthough I have set this down for your La: in 2. or 3.
days (for it is noe longer since you commanded me to do it) yet it is the
production and result of many hours meditations by my self; or rather of some
years: and how dry soever they may appear to your La: at the first; yet I
dare promise you that upon your second and third readings and reflections upon
them, they will gain more credit with you; and you will (I know) by such
application of your thoughts upon them, enlarge and refine what depends of
the maine heads far beyond any thing I have said. For such is the nature of
notions that are wrought, like the silk worms ball, of ones own substance:
they afford fine and strong threads for a good workman to weaue into a fair
piece of stuff: whereas they that like bees do gather honey from several
authors; or that like Aunts, do make up their store by what they pick up in
the original crude substance from others labors; may peradventure in their
works seem more pleasant at the first taste, or appear to have a fayrer
heap at the first view, but the others webb is more useful, more
substantial, and more durable.

I beseech God of his grace and goodness, in this life to enlighten your La:
understanding that you may discern truth, and to dispose your will that you
may embrace it; and in the next, to give you part among those glorious
Apostles, Fathers, Doctors, and Martyrs that deriuing the same truth from him,
have from hand to hand delivered it over to our times.

FINIS.
