A Proclamation appointing the time when his Majesty's subjects may attend to
be cured of the Disease, commonly called, The Kings Evil.
WHereas by the grace and blessing of Almighty God, the Kings and Queens of
this Realm by many ages past, have had the happiness by their Sacred touch,
to cure those who are afflicted with the disease called, The Kings Evil: And
his now most Excellent Majesty, in no less measure then any of his Royal
Progenitors, has had blessed success therein: And in His most gracious and
pious disposition, is as ready and willing as any King or Queen of this Realm
ever was, in any thing to relieve the distresses and necessities of His good
Subjects: Yet in His Princely wisdom foreseeing, that in this (as in all
other things) order is to be observed, and fit times are necessary to be
appointed for performing of this great work of Charity; And taking into His
Royal consideration, how adverse and dangerous travel in the winter season is
to the health of grieved and diseased persons, especially to such as live in
the remote Counties of this Kingdom, does therefore hereby publish and declare
His Royal pleasure to be, and also wills and commands, that from the time
of the publishing of this Proclamation, no person or persons whatsoever, do
attempt or presume to repair to His Majesty's Royal Court to be healed of
that disease, before the Feast of the Birth of Our Lord God now next coming.
And to the end that all His loving Subjects may the better take knowledge of
this His Majesty's pleasure and command, His pleasure is, that this
Proclamation be published and affixed in some fit and open place in every
Market town of this Realm.

Given at His Majesty's Palace at Hampton Court this three and twentieth day of
September, in the tenth year of the Reign of our Sovereign Lord CHARLES by
the grace of God King of England, Scotland, France, and Ireland, Defender of
the Faith, etc.

MAJESTY: and by the Assigns of John Bill. 1634.
