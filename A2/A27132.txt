A MESSAGE Sent forth from the RISEN SEED OF GOD, BEING A faithful
expostulation and Testimony concerning the unjust and hard dealings of the
Rulers and people in ENGLAND, WHO Have a hand in the cruel oppressions and
sufferings of the people of God called QUAKERS.
HArken and give ear ye Sons of men, and consider what ye are doing in making
snares, traps and Gods (...) Innocent people, what have we done against the
Righteous holy God, or against any of his Laws, or against any righteous just
Laws of men, (since we were a people called and chosen of God out of the ways
and vanities of this worlds) that you should thus oppress, abuse and persecute
us, as if we were not worthy to ^^^e upon the face of the earth? Why do ye thus
built us as a (...) upon the Mountains, and as sheep for the slaughter? What
evil have we done? or what is our offense, that you like Saul pursue us; If you
pretend and say we are breaker of the Kings Laws, or Queens Laws, or Acts of
Parliaments, or the like, of this be the only cause, then let me query or
reason with you in Gods behalf: What are those Laws or Acts of Parliament, and
the ground of them, by which a harmless and Innocent people are thus caused to
suffer, who breaks not the Law of Christ and of God, but worship him in the
Spirit and truth, with our heart and understanding, mind and strength, and
loves our neighbor as our selves, as God is witness, and even prays that God
would open the eyes of them that hate us and despitfully use us, had not them
in Daniels time, and in the Jews time, and in Shedreck, Mesheck, and Abednegos
time Laws and Decrees sealed with Kings seals, which was against God and his
dear children, (which worshipped him in spirit and truth as we do now) who
suffered such things for the trial of their faith and patience for a season,
yea, he suffered Cain to kill his brother Abel, about sacrifice and worship, he
suffered Judas to betray Christ our elder brother, and the Rulers and Priests
to crucify and murder him by a Law, but what Law was it by which the Son of
God was out to death, judge ye; was it not made in man's will by that spirit
that protect the good words, and had the sheeps Clothing that did say and not
do: and were not the Scribes and Pharisees and Rulers and Chief Priests
Hipocrits that did so, and had not they their portion in the Lake that burns;
And did not he say to them if you have done these things to the green tree,
what will they do to the dry; And was not he had from Prison to Judgment, and
(...) amongst ^^ngressors, and is it not so now between you and us as it was
then, the enmity between the two Seeds and Births; read and let Gods witness
which reproves you in secret answer: And did not he suffer the Prophets to be
stoned by the great professing City and is (...), and Prist Pas^ir to smite
Jeremiah on the mouth, and to (...) put in the (...) Dungeon for speaking the
truth, and sufferd Zachariah (...) be slain between the Porch and the Alter,
and Stephen to be stoned for witnessing against Temples made with hands; any
many such things God did suffer that evil and a (...) upon his servants and
tender Children, who says to their oppressors in this age, as he did then,
fill ye up the measures of your Fathers that upon you may come the vengeance,
for all the righteous bloodshed from Zachariah to this day.

Are not you in the way of Cain, are not you in the way of the Jews, are not
you in the way of the Heathen that did rage and the people that did imagine vain
things, who took Counsel together, against the Lord and his anointed ones,
saying let us break their bands asunder and cast away their Cords from us, and
are not you now saying within your selves, and among your selves, let us break
their meetings, and cast away or banish their strength from us, that their name
may be bloted out, and their remembrance from amongst us, but he that sits in
Heaven has you in derision, who will laugh at your callamnity, and mock when
your fear and destruction comes as a whirlwind: Are you not like Herod (that
subtle Fox,) who sought the young Child's life as soon as it was born, and was
not he prevented though he slew all the Males in that Region, about two years
old or under; and are you nor like Pharaoh, and those dark Egyptians,
Enchanters, Magicians and Wise men, who said let us deal wisely with them,
least they multiply and become great in number, and so enjoined the Midwives to
kill all the Males of the Hebrews, but was not Moses then born, and hid from
them in an Ark of Bulrushes, whom God had appointed to be the leader and
deliverer of his people out of Egypt, even thus are you deceived and God will
prevent you and your intents, as he did them and theirs, whose Decrees were
frustrated, and Laws and Counsels of none effect, for God has sworn by
himself, and he will perform it, that no weapon formed against Jacob or his
seed shall prosper, nor any Enchantment or divination, against his Israel shall
prevail, for he has determined to exalt Truth and Righteousness in the earth,
and to throw down wickedness, oppression, Idolatry, and ungodliness, and he
will take the wise in their own craftiness, and lay low even to the dust, all
the powers of the earth, who exalt themselves against him and his heritage, he
respects not the persons of men, but will trample the ungodly as in a
Wine Press, in his fury for his seed sake, who has said to us his babes and
children, concerning our oppressions, fear ye not the face of man, nor the
revilings and threatenings of the sons of men, whose breath is in their
nostriles, that shall be made as grass, the moth shall eat them up like wool;
and I Will plead my cause with them, in their Consciences by my own witness,
which sees in secret, and beholds all their hard speeches, and ungodly deeds,
which they have proudly spoken against me and my people; for vengeance is mine,
and I will repay it says the Lord: Therefore hear now ye Rulers, Priests,
Soldiers and people this day in England, who are brewing your hands in the
blood of the Innocent, and let me reason with you concerning these things; What
was Cain and his way, to which the woe belongs to this day, was he not of the
wicked one who slew his brother about worship and sacrifice, and are not they
of the wicked one, (the murderer from the beginning) so now, let Gods witness
in you answer, and what was Balaam and his way, who loved the wages of
unrighteousness, whose madness and folly the dumb Ass with man's voice
reproved, if you have ears to hear, hear, for many that has been as dumb rod
upon by you, and your predesessors, begins now to speak with man's voice, and
are not you and your Teachers found in Cains way, and Balaams way; will not you
murder and rob, and banish, and imprison and persecute about sacrifice and
worship? Is not this Cains way and Balaams way; do not flatten your selves, nor
daub with untempted mortar, but let the witness of the just God arise and
answer, which will speak the truth; which will be as a worm and moth, in the
heart and bowels of the ungodly and hypocrites for ever, if you repent not with
speed, if your Common prayers, and homilies, and Organs be the fruit of your
ground, can you not offer it to your God and be content, or will not your God
accept it at your hands, without you murder, rob, and persecute us, who offer
unto our God Male and firsting of our flock, which opens the womb holy to the
Lord; if you do well shall you not be accepted, but if not sin lies at your
door like Cain, whose countenance fell who was wrath and slew his brother;
consider these things for you have either a wicked God, (the Devil the God of
this world) or your sacrifices are wicked and abominable, or you offer it with
wicked hands, for God said unto Cain why art thou wrath? and why is thy
countenance falling? if thou do well shall thou not be accepted, but if not
sin lies at the door, ^^d your state now you that can sing and pray, and
murder about it, and make laws against the true worshippers of the living God
in spirit and truth, and see what you are doing, and how far you are out of
Cains way, and the Pharisees way, who could pay Tyth, and fast twice a week,
and make long prayers or Common prayers as well as you, (and kill Christ Jesus
and his Disciples) who had the Lattin, Greek and Hebrew as well as you, and see
what you differ from them, and whether you are not of the same seed of evil
dooers, and let the witness of the dreadful God Judge in this matter, who will
not be mocked with your Sacrifices and prayers, and will-worships, and feigned
humiliations, its all abomination to him; therefore repent least while you
rejoice in the sound of your Organs, he sweep you down to Hell; And be awakened
to Judgment, and arise and behold the great Controversy which is at this day
between Cain, and Abel* Christ and Antichrist, Light and darkness,
Righteousness and unrighteousness, Truth and deceit and wickedness, what shall
I say of it, but in plainess between God and the Devil, the Lamb and the
Dragon, Michael the Archangel, and the Devil and his Angels; and consider and
see of whose side ye now are, and whether you are not them of whom Enock the
seventh from Adam prophesied, and Jude declared ungodly men, raging waves of
the Sea, foaming out your own shame, speaking evil of things you know not,
filthy dreamers, walking after your own ungodly Iusts, the mockers and scoffers
in these last days, speaking evil of Dignities, and despising Dominion, (even
the sons and Children of the most high God, and their Kingdom and Dominion
which has no end, of which Abel and Enock was, whose life and Kingdom you know
not,) who of old were ordained to this condemnation, heady high minded, self
willed, lovers of pleasures more then lovers of God; and whether you are not
those Wells without water, and Clouds without rain carried about with a
Tempest, having a form of Religion, but denying the power of God; and
persecutes them that live in it.

And whether you are not the Heathen that live at ease, with whom God is very
sore displeased, which helps forward the affliction of his people, read your
state and your portion, Zach. 1.15. Zeph. 1.15, 16, 17, 18. etc. And whether
you are not them that chant at the sound of the Viol, and drink Wine in Bowls,
and eat the Lambs out of the flocks, and anoint your selves with the chief
Ointments, inventing to your selves Instruments of Music like David, and are
not greeved for the afflictions of Joseph, putting far away the evil day, and
c^^^sing the seat of violence and oppression come near ye which rejooce in a
thing of naught; read Amos 6 and within with Gods witness in your Consciences,
and then behold us in your Goal holes and stinking places of cruelty, who are
a poor and an afflicted people, whose trust is in the name of the Lord; for
thus says the Lord God concerning us who tremble at his word, I will appear to
your joy, and they that hate you shall be ashamed; and I will lead Joseph like
a flock, and set the sollatry in families, and they shall rejoice in my
highness, and sing for the glory of my Majesty, and I will joy over them and
rejoice to do them good; But as for you, your wresting of Judgment, and your
turning of things upside down, and your Sword backward shall be rewarded upon
your own heads; for as you have oppressed and lead into Captivity my people,
and broke your words and Covenants, and your promises and engagements con^^ming
them and their worships of me the living God, which is in the Spirit and Truth
(which shall not be limited;) Even so shall you be oppressed and go into
Captivity, and be dealt treacherously with; for with the same measure you meet
to them, shall others meet to you again; And who do you think will keep their
Oaths, Covenants, promises and engagements to them, that are false in their own
to others; consider these things for because of swearing and forswearing,
promising and treacherous dealing, Convenanting and breaking of the same, the
Land mourns, and will mourn, until the spirit of Lies deceit and falsehood is
banished from amongst you; but the Proverb is true, the Tongue of the Just is as
choice Silver, but the heart of the wicked is little worth, much less their
words.

What are you? Or what is your power? Or whence came you? that you in your
Generation should deal thus treacherously with God and man, to grind the faces
of the poor, and eat up my people like bread, and slay them, and chop their
flesh as for the Chaldron, will not blood be required at the hand of him that
shed it, have not many of my Children suffered to death, by your cruel
imprisonments, and knockings down in their meeetings, to waire upon me, who had
no other end but to worship me, as I am witness between you and them for ever;
was not the death of Uriah laid to David's charge, though he slew him not with
his own hands, but consented to it, and not restrained it, who had the power in
his hand; and shall not my witness in you, be the Nathan (...) your particular
Consciences; and say thou art the man, for thou consentedst to it and not
restrained it when the power was in thy hand: Consider these things before it
be to late, and your day pass as the chafe before the wind, for I the Lord God
am jealous for Zion, with great jealousy, and I will plead her cause with all
her Enemies.

Or will your saying we have a Law or an Act of Parliament, and by our Law or
Act they ought not to meet above four or five, and by our Law they ought to be
imprisoned, or banished, or they ought to dye, or abjure the Land; save you in
the day of my fury says the Lord, will your Kings Laws, or Queens laws, or
Parliaments laws or decrees, stand you in stead, help hide or save you, when I
shall descend upon you in flames of fire, rendering vengeance on all them that
obey not my Law and Gospel, written and preached in the heart of every man and
woman under Heaven; or will your lying Indictments aad Warrants plead for you
which you say my people meet in force of Arms in contempt of the King his
Crown and dignity; or will your writing them dangerous, seditious, and wicked
Sectaries, and disloyal persons, cover you? will not all Englands sober people
give you the lie in these things; who knows our manner and conversation among
them? yea, and will not the witness of God in your own Consciences testify the
same with them? or will Elizabeth's Statute 35. or she her self rise from the
dead, to keep off my vengeance that is hastening upon you for your lies,
injustice and cruelty? will your writing the Assemblys of my people unlawful?
make them so in my sight? was not Daniels prayer unlawful? and the Apostles
preaching forbidden by the Rulers? but was it so in my sight? judge ye, might
not they have said as well as you, they break the peace of Kings and people;
were there not great stirs and tumults in all ages, about my people, against
them in whom my spirit of truth was manifest; could the whole Land bear my
servant Amos his words: Consider what peace is broken, or against what peace my
people are: whose weapons are not Carnal and what people are terrified by them
or their meetings in my name and fear, in Truth and Righteousness as you have
written, (to the great terror of the people) by your lies to render them
odious, and let my witness in you answer, for I am not come to send peace on
earth but a sword, and a fire, which is already kindled, and you shall never be
abe to quench it, for I have raised my seed in my children, and have placed
them as a brazen wall in the midst of Nations (against the flood of
ungodliness, Idolatry and wickedness, else you had ere this, been destroyed as
Sodom, in whom I will manifest my terrible power and Kingdom, which has no
end; against the Devils Power and Kingdom, which must end against Oppression
and Oppressors, murder and Murderers; injustice, cruelty, Idolatry and
hypocricy, and all manner of ungodliness and unrighteousness of men; which
power shall grind the grinders, and bruise the bruisers and oppressors of my
people; and shall tread upon Princes as upon mortar, for I am arisen, and come
and coming in thousands and ten thousands of my saints and Children who tremble
at my word, to convince all that are ungodly of their ungodly deeds and hard
speeches, and to execute my Judgments upon the rebelious, and gainsaying
Generation; and I will gather my Lambs into my bosom, and the Seed of Jacob
into their own Land, and the meek shall inherit the Earth, and the poor in
spirit shall possess my Everlasting Kingdom, against which work now begun,
neither you nor all the Rulers of the darkness of this World, your Kings,
Queens and Parliaments, with their Laws and decrees, Gog nor Magog, Sodom nor
Gomorah, Egypt, Death nor Hell, with the strength and gates of it, shall be
able to prevail or overcome, I the Lord God of Heaven and earth (that made the
Worlds in mine eternal word and unchangeable decree) has spoken it.

Therefore these things in the fear of God (if you have any) and in soberness
consider, for it shall stand a living Testimony which shall not be made void,
but is dropped upon you as an hour of Gods Visitation the which if you slight and
repent not of your deeds and unrighteous proceedings against his people, you
shall be left without excuse in the Terrible day at hand, which hastens upon
you as a Woman in travel that is ready to be delivered, and you shall not
escape; Therefore prise your time, and be not proud nor Rebellious for the Lord
has spoken, neither be ye mockers, least your bands are made strong, but
believe and tremble, and remember the King of Ninnive, who shall rise up in
Judgment against this Generation and Condemn it, for a greater then Jonah, and
a greater then Solomon is risen among us, who respects not the persons of
men, but will plead with all flesh which has Corrupted its way, by fire and
Sword, and the Slain of the Lord shall be many, even all the workers of
Iniquity, which hates reproof, despises good Counsel, and does not choose the
fear of the Lord.

So this is unto you a Visitation and warning, (from him that lives for ever)
of whose blood I his servant am clear, having obeyed his voice) whether you
hear or forbear.

I am a Traveller for Sions sake, and a trembler at the word of the great
dreadful God, the Righteous Judge of quick and dead, and a follower of the
Lamb, through the great tribulations, loving not my life to the death for his
sake, Halelujah Amen. W.B.

And FRIENDS,
TEll me how you came to be Christians, and by what Law you were lead to
Christ, was it Queen Marys Law without you. or Queen Elizabeth's which you now
Act by, or was it the new Covenant, which God made unto his people? If these
Laws before mentioned, as Queen Elizabeth's or Marys, be now the scoolmaster,
when came they in force; And when was Moses the just man the leader of the
people out of Egypt, and the Law which God gave to him disanulled? And when was
the Covenant broken between Moses and God? did not he stay (...) wrath, and
stand in the gap between God and his people, and prayed to God for them and God
heard his prayer, and his wrath was turned away from Israel, whom Moses lead
out of Egypt, to be tried in the Wilderness, as many are at this day, blessed
be God; and Moses the Instrument which brought them thither, and cursed be they
who disobey the command of God given to Moses, which is fulfilled in Christ the
Elder brother, and them that follow him, who breaks not the commands of God
given to Moses; but fulfilleth them in his sufferings, which is now making up
at this day.

Have a care what you do in fighting against God in his Members, you who
profess your selves to be Christians, Magistrates; persecutors of others who
are members of Christ's body, who was persecuted by chief Priests and Rulers who
professed they had more knowledge of God then them, they persecuted; but their
Condemnation was the greater, for that they were sayers and not doers; as many
of you are at this day professing Christ in words but serving an hypocritical
generation.

Woe to the Pharisees says Christ; and woe to the Christians now, who profess
Christ in words, and in their works and practices deny him, who make long
prayers, and their hands full of cruelty and blood, and makes their seat a
place of violence, that Justice and Truth cannot be heard; but the simple and
upright in heart will learn Judgment; and the prudent in Queen Elizabeth and
Marys Laws, who refuse the Law of God to be their Rule, will God cut off,
though called Justices, Chief Priests or Rulers: Look ye to it for the hand of
Justice and true Judgment is lifted up, that the heritage of God shall be
known, not by the Law of Queen Elizabeth or Mary which is now in hand; but by
Jesus the King of the Jews, the Son of the living God the highest amongst men,
the greatest in the Consciences of all his people; Swear not at all says he,
who is come to be Lord in the Conscience, and ^one else shall Rule over his
Heritage, though now it seems to be trampled upon by injustice and
unrighteousness. which is Acted by unrighteous men, who are but as the drop of
a Bucket and dust defore him; Therefore dread the Lord, ye Kings and Rulers for
the Judgment is now seting up, which respects not the ways of Kings, because
the heart of Kings are in the hand of the Lord who can turn them as a River of
Water, which way he pleases, and their Life is in his hand as a span;
Therefore I say dread the Lord all Flesh. for the day of the Lord hastens and
is even at the doors.

To the truth of which, I subscribe M.B.

SEek not by Laws, made in man's will
The blood of Innocents to spill,
For if you do, the Law of God
With in your heart, shall be the Rod
Which shall you smite, with strokes full soar
And you Condemn, for evermore;
For your decrees, which are unjust
They shall not stand, Gods Counsel must.
Professions, words and prayers long,
He has no pleasure in
Without the life of righteousness,
All Scarifice is Sin;
The day is broke, and God's just stroke
On Hypocrites must come,
Their many words and Carnal swords
Cannot save them from their doom,
Amen.
THE END.
