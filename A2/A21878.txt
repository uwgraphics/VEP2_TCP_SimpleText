By the Queen.
THe Queens Majesty understanding of the common wandering abroad of a great
multitude of her people, whereof the most part pretend, that they have served
in the wars of late on the other side of the Seas, though in truth it is
known, that very many of them, either have not served at all, or have not
been licenced to depart from the places of their service, as they ought to have
been, but have run away from their service, and therefore they are justly to
be punished, and not to be relieved: some others are such as have indeed
served, and fallen into sickness, and therefore licenced to depart toward
their Countries, from whence they were levied, and do deserve relief, To the
intent all her Majesty's Officers of Justice in every place, where these sorts
of people shall resort, may know, what her Majesty's most gracious pleasure
is, for the usage of the said persons, both to punish the offenders, and to
relieve the sick soldiers, and such as have truly served, and are licenced
to depart to their Countries: She commands that such discretion be used
betwixt the unlawful vagarant persons, and the soldiers now lawfully
dismissed from their services, that all such vagarant persons, as neither have
been brought to sickness nor lamenesse by the said late service, and that
shall not be able to show sufficient pasport for their dismission, shall be
taken and apprehended, wheresoever they may be found, as persons vagabonds, and
so to be punished. And if any of them shall allege, that they have been in
her Majesty's pay on the other side the Seas, and cannot show sufficient
pasport from the Lord General, or some of the principal Officers of the
army, then to be taken and committed to prison, and to be indicted as felons,
and to suffer for the same, as soldiers being in her Majesty's pay, that have
run away, and left the service traitorously. And for the rest that have
served as soldiers, and can show their lawful pasports, they ought to be
relieved by some charitable means, to conduct them into their Country, with
commendation of public Letters from the Justices of the Peace where they
shall be found, to all other Ministers both spiritual and temporal, both to
grant them reasonable relief and aid for their passage, and to be
particularly relieved by the Parishes or Hundreds, from whence they were levied
during the time of their infirmities and sickness, as in conscience they
ought, and so to be placed with their former Masters, as by her Majesty's late
directions to the Counties has been ordered and appointed: And nevertheless,
with special pains to be added to the same Letters of commendations of
Pasports, that if they shall be found to wander abroad out of the ordinary
ways mentioned in their Pasports, that then, they are to be punished as
vagabonds.

And her Majesty lets it to be known, that order is given by her, that her
Treasorer of wars has and shall make payment (in every Port where any such
shall arrive coming with lawful Pasport) of such sums of money, as shall be
convenient to conduct them to the places from which they were levied. And that
all Officers of Ports shall be allowed by the said Treasorer any such sums of
money, as by them shall be paid to any such lawful soldiers. And
furthermore, for the repressing of the great number of mighty and hable
vagarant persons now wandering abroad under pretense of begging as soldiers,
although in deed they are known to commit open robberies upon her Majesty's
poor subjects and trauaillers by the way: Her Majesty straightly charge all
her Lieutenantes of every County within the Realm (having sufficient warrant
by their Commission to execute Martial Law upon such offenders against the
public peace and state of the Realm) to appoint some special persons within
their jurisdictions to travel within the Counties as Prouost-Marshals, and to
give directions to the Justices of the Peace to assist the Prouost-Marshall,
for the apprehension of all such notable offenders, and to commit them to
prison, and thereupon to be executed, as by the Laws of the Realm they shall
deserve.

Given at our Manor of Richmond, the fifth day of November and in the three and
thirtieth year of our reign.

(...) on, there is manifest proof in that a number of men of wealth in our
realm professing contrary religion, are known not to be impeached for the
same, either in their lives, lands, or goods, or in their liberties, but
only by payment of a pecuniary sum, as a penalty for the time that they do
refuse to come to Church, which is a most manifest course to falsify the
slanderous speeches and Libelles of the Fugitives abroad. Yet now it is
certainly understood, that these heads of these dens and receptacles, which
are by the traitors called Seminaries, and Colleges of Jesuits, have very
lately assured the King of Spain, that though heretofore he had no good
success with his great forces, against our Realm, yet if now he will once
again renew his war this next year, there shall be found ready secretly
within our Dominions, many thousands as they make their account for their
purpose; of able people that will be ready to assist such power as he shall set
on land, and by their vain vaunting, they do tempt the King hereto, who
otherwise ought in wisdom, and by his late experience conceive no hope of any
safe landing here: showing to him in Spain, by the special information of a
Scholeman named Parsons, arrogating to himself the name of the King Catholics
Confessor, and to the Pope at Rome, by another Scholar called Allen, now for
his treasons, honored with a Cardinals Hatte, certain skrolles or
beadrolles of names, of men dwelling in sundry parts of our Countries, as they
have imagined them, but specially in the maritimes, with assurance, that these
their Seedmen named Seminaries, Priests, and Jesuits are in the sundry parts
of the Realm secretly harbored, having a great part of them been sent within
these x. or xii. months, and shall be ready to continue their reconciled
people in their lewd constancy to serve their purpose both with their forces,
and with other traiterous enterprises when the Spanish power shall be ready to
land, upon which their impudent assertions to the Pope, and to the King of
Spain (though they know a great part thereof to be false) they have now very
lately advertised into diverse parts by their secret messengers, whereof some
are also very lately taken, and have confessed the same, that the King upon
their informations and requests has promised to employ all his forces that he
can, by sea this next year, to attempt once again the invasion of this realm:
Wherewith because some of his wisest counselors doubt that he shall not
prevail, therefore he is otherwise persuaded, that if that his purpose shall
not take place here, yet the same may be well employed against France or the
Low Countries, or against some part of Scotland, into which Realm there has
also some number of the like brood been lately sent.

2 Wherefore considering that these the intentions of the King of Spain, are
to us in this sort made very manifest, And although we doubt not, but almighty
God, the defender of all just causes, will (as always hitherto he has) make the
same boyde: Yet it is our duty as being the supreme Governor under his
Almighty hand, to use al such just and reasonable means as are given to us,
and therewith to concur or rather attend upon his most gracious savor by the
help of our faithful subjects, both to increase our forces to the uttermost
of their powers, and by execution of Laws, and by all other politic
ordinances to impeach the foresaid practices of these seditions and treasons.

3 And before al other things, we do first require of the Ecclesiastical state,
that the like diligence be used by the godly Ministers of the Church, by their
diligent teaching and example of life, to retain our people steadfastly in the
profession of the Gospel, and in their duties to almighty God and us, as it
is seen a few Capital heads of treasons are continually occupied with their
Seminaries, in withdrawing of a multitude of ignorants to their enchantments.

4 And secondly, for having of sufficient forces in readiness by Sea, we hope
by Gods goodness, and with the help of our good Subjects, to have as great, or
greater strength on the Seas then at any time we have had, to withstand these
puffed vaunts from Spain: And for our forces by land, our trust is, that
seeing we have distributed our whole realm into several charges of
Lieutenancies, that they by themselves where they may be personally present,
and otherwise by their Deputies, and assistants of other our Ministers, will
now after the general Musters which have been by our special order lately
taken, consider of all things requisite to perform, and make perfect all
defects that shall appear necessary, to make all the bands both of horsemen
and footmen fully furnished with armor, weapons, and munition, and with all
other things requisite for their conduction to the places of service, and there
also to continue as time shall require to defend their Country. And so we do
most earnestly require and charge all manner of our Subjects, with their hands,
purses, and aduises, yea all and every person of every estate, with their
prayers to God, to move him to assist this so natural, honorable, and
profitable a service being only for defense of their natural Country, their
wives, families, children, lands, goods, liberties, and their posterities
against ravening strangers, wilful destroyers of their Native country and
monstrous traitors.

5 And lastly, to withstand and provide speedy remedy against the other
fraudulent attempts of the Seminaries, Jesuits, and Traitors, without the
which (as it appears) the forces should not be now used, the same being
wrought only by falsehoode, by hypocrisy, and by underminings of our good
Subjects under a false color and face of holiness, to make breathes in men's and
women's consciences, and so to train them to their Treasons, and that with such
a secrecy by the harboring of the said traitorous messengers in obscure
places, as without very diligent and continual search to be made, and severe
orders executed, the same will remain and spread it self as a secret infection
of treasons in the bowels of our Realm, most dangerous, yea, most reproachful
to be suffered in any well ordered common weal: Therefore we have determined
by advise of our Counsel, to have speedily certain Commissioners, men of
honesty, fidelity, and good reputation to be appointed in every Shire, City,
and Port towns within our Realm, to enquire by all good means what persons
are by their behauiours or otherwise worthy to be suspected to be any such
persons, as have been sent, or that are employed in any such persuading of our
people or of any residing within our Realm to treason, or to move any to
relinquish their allegiance to us, or to acknowledge any kind of obedience to
the Pope, or to the King of Spain, and also of all other persons that have
been thereto induced, and that have thereto yielded. And further to proceed in
the execution of such their Commission as they shall be more perticularly
directed by instructions annexed to their said Commission.

6 And furthermore, because it is certainly known and proved by common
experience, upon the apprehension of sundry of the said traiterous persons
sent into the Realm, that they do come into the same by secret Creekes, and
landing places, disguised, both in their names and persons. Some in apparel,
as Soldiers, Mariners, or Merchants, pretending that they have been heretofore
taken prisoners, and put into Galleys, and delivered. Some come in as gentlemen
with contrary names, in comely apparel, as though they had travailed into
Foreign countries for knowledge: And generally all, or the most part, as soon
as they are crept in, are clothed like gentlemen in apparel, and many as
gallants, yea in all colors, and with feathers, and such like disguising
themselves, and many of them in their behauior as Russians, far off to be
thought, or suspected to be Friars, Priests, Jesuits, or Popish scholars. And
of these many do attempt to resort into the Universities and houses of Law
from whence in former times they departed: many into services of Noble men,
Ladies and gentlemen, with such like fraudulent devises to cover themselves
from all apprehension, or suspicion: and yet in process of time, they do at
length so insinuate themselves to get themselus credit with hypocrisies, as
they insect both the Masters and Families, and consequently adventure also yea
secretly to use their offices of priesthood and reconcilements: Whereby al such
as do retain them are worthy to be suspected, and may be charged by law to
their great danger.

7 For avoiding whereof, and either to discover these venomous vipers, or to
chase them away out of the Realm from the infecting of many more, we do order
and straightly charge and command all manner of persons of what degree soever
they be without any exception, Spiritual, or Temporal, Nobleman, Gentleman,
Lord, Lady, Master or Mistress, or owner whatsoever of any house, family,
lodging, yea the very Officers of our own household, and Governors of any
societies, to make a present due and particular Inquisition of all manner of
persons that have been admitted, or suffered to have usual resort, diet,
lodging, residence in their houses, or in any place by their appointment, at
any time within the space of one whole year now past, and ended at Michaelmas
last: Or that from thenceforth have, or shall be admitted, or suffered so to
resort, eat, lodge, reside or attend: And by such Inquisition and examination,
to be duly and particularly informed of what condition and country any such
person is, and by what kind of means he has heretofore lived, and where he
has spent his time for the space of one whole year before. And likewise to
know whether he has used, and does use to repair to the Church at usual
times to divine service, according to the laws of the Realm. And to cause
those Inquisitions, with their answers to be put into writing particularly,
and the same to keep in a manner of a Register or Calendar to be showed when
they shall be demanded, that upon cause of suspicion of any such person, the same
may be further tried by the Commissioners of those places, whether the same
persons so examined be loyal subjects or no. And if any such shall be found
unwilling to answer to such Inquisition, or shall be found by his doubtful
answer not likely to be an obedient subject, the same person shall be stayed
by the householder, or him that ought to have examined him and shall be sent to
any of the Commissioners above mentioned next adjoining. And if any person
having government or commandment over any such servant, or resiant, shall be
found not to have performed the points of the foresaid Inquisition as is above
limited, the same shall be called to appear before the said Commissioners,
or before our privy Counsel, if the quality of the person shall so require,
and shall be further used and ordered for such default, as the said
Commissioners, or our Counsel shall have just cause to deal with such a person.
And finally, we do admonish and straightly charge and command all persons that
have had any intelligence, with any such so sent or come from beyond the seas
to such purposes, to detect them to the Commissioners in that behalf to be
assigned as aforesaid, within xx. days after the publication hereof, in the
Shire, Town, or City, or Port, within the precincts of the same Commission,
upon pain that the offenders therein, shall be punished as abettors and
mainteiners of traitors. Wherein we are resolutely determined to suffer no
favor to be used for any respect of any persons, qualities, or degrees, nor
shall allow, or suffer to be allowed any excuse of negligence for not detection,
or for not due examination of the qualities of such dangerous persons according
to the order hereafore prescribed, being no wise contrary, but agreeable to the
most ancient laws, and good vsages of our Realm, devised for the good order
of all manner of Subjects in every precinct of any Leete to be forthcomming to
answer for their behauior toward the dignity of our Crown, and the common
peace of our Realm.

Given at our Manor of Richmond the xviii. of October, 1591. in this xxxiii.
year of our reign.
God save the Queen.
