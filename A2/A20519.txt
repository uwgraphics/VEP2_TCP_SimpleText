DOBSONS Dry BOBBES:

Son and Heir to Skoggin.

Full of mirth and delightful recreation.



LONDON Printedby VALENTINE SIMMES 1607.

To the Reader.
THere is nothing more delightful than mirthfull recreation, which I doubt not
but whosoever shall peruse this small Treatise, will be sufficiently
satisfied: It is like unto a Garden wherein each humor may have his several
walk private and vntrequented (as yet) of any Passengers. It is no foreign
translation, but a homebred subject, nor does he desire any other thing than
his patrimony, which is, as being the eldest son of Skoggin, to be esteemed
for no Changeling, only by how much the property of his father was fit to
be altered, he has by so much, in the quantity of his time reformed: he is to
ancient men mirth, to the middle age profit, and to youth nurture, pregnant
wit: To conclude, he is George Dobson, whose pleasant meriments are worthy
to be registered among the famous Records of the ieasting Worthies: yea* he
has proceeded farther in degree than Garagantua, Howleglasse, Tiell, Skoggin,
old Hobson, or Cocle: He has put himself to the public view of all men,
and desires to bear you company to your private Studies, where when your
leisure does permit you, his presence may delight you. And so I bid you
heartily farewell.

DOBSONS DRY BOBS.
How sir Thomas Pentley adopted George Dobson for his son. Chap. 1.
IN the City of Durham was sometime resident, one sir Thomas Pentley, a
Priest, instituted after the old order used in Queen Mary's days, who for
his exquisite skill in music, was admitted to be a Canonist in the Cathedral
church of Durham: and for he was also otherwise supposed learned, and a man of
modest life, he was beneficed besides with the vicarage of Saint Giles in the
same town: by reason whereof he waxed very rich, and a great penny father,
living always unmarried, and keeping no household or retinue about him, save
only one of his sisters, whose husband dying, he took home to be his huswife:
after that there was a dissolution made of their Cloister, and that it was
thought fit for men, rather to live at their own choice, than at others
appointment, granting all that would, liberty to take wives, and they whose
stomach stood against that estate of matrimony, to dispose of themselves as
to them seemed good and most correspondent to their liking. This sir Thomas, in
time, seeing his money to increase, and his wealth to abound, resolved with
himself, since he was determined never to take wife, whereby to have
children, unto whom he might leave this his abundance and riches (I say)
resolved with himself, to dispose of it in some good sort during his life
time, lest otherwise his friends, after his death, should go together by the
ears in dividing the stake. Therefore he began, by little and little, to
play the good fellow, causing his sister, who was both Cook and Cater, to
provide him good and plenteous fare, inuiting also his neighbors and others
his acquaintances to dine and to suppe with him: especially upon solemn
feasts, as Christmasse, and Easter, he kept open house, and gave good and
bounteous entertainment unto all that would come. And so prodigally he spent,
as in the end his huswife began to repine at his large hospitality,
persuading her self, that if he continued this course long, it would be but a
very little that would fall in diuidence to his friends after his death, and
therefore she thought every way as good to take part with him, as to exspect
that which the cat leaves in the malt. Whereupon she sent to her other sister
dwelling in the country, who was married to one Ieffrey Dobson, certifying her
of their brothers unthriftiness, withal, admonishing her to make a speedy
repair unto the city, and with her to bring her husband, children, and
family to make their abode, dwelling, and stay with sir Thomas: For otherwise,
if she omitted that opportunity, it was a very probable matter, that her
share of his goods would be very slender, and far short of her exspectation,
for our brother, says she, is fallen into such an humor of spending, that
his yearly revenues will scarcely dischardge his yearly expense. Her sister
at this news became as pale as ashes, and sore she feared that all would be
gone before she could get her family removed to the town. And as though sir
Thomas had been already dead, and the executors gone away with all the goods,
she ran to the fields, where her husband was at the plow, to make known
unto him what message her sister had sent her. The good man who had taken her
to wife, more in regard of that benefit he hoped to reap by her after sir
Thomas his death, than any other respect, made no less haste to be remoouing,
than she desired: and so forthwith loosing his oxen forth of their teame,
commanding his men to go home and thresh forth all his corn presently, and
his wife to pack up all her household stuff and napery against the next
morning, himself went forth presently to a neighbors house near by, and let
to him the lease of his farm: and coming home that night, his wife having
dispatched every thing according to his commandment, he conveyed his stuff,
so much as he thought needful, to the city of Durham next morning, carrying
with him his wife and children, whom he brought with him to the vicarage of S.
Giles, at the very instant when sir Thomas was set to dinner, but newly come
home from the Minster, where (according to his custom, he had been helping
to sing divine Service. Whiles sir Thomas was eagerly caruing such meats as
were set upon the table, his appetite being very sharp, he suddenly heard a
great rushing and noise of carts, rattling upon the stones within the court,
and maruelling whence such noise should come, if it were not there, and what
occasion any had to be there, he could not conjecture, since himself had no use
for any at all, neither did he know of any that had business there to do,
more than half misdoubting his hearing, he started forthwith from the table,
and looking forth at his window, he did behold his court full of carts,
laden with tables, cupbords, beds, and such like household stuff, at which
sight he was not alittle amazed, fearing that the Bishop had endowed some other
with the benefice of that vicarige, meaning to deprive him, and that the carts
and stuff appeared to be the new parsons: yet he no less marvelled why the
Bishop should so do, considering that he no way ill deserved, either committed
any thing whereby to incur the Bishops displeasure. Also, if this his
supposall were true, he thought it strange and uncharitable dealing, that he
should in such manner be excluded, without either admonishment or notice given
to provide for himself. But presently, as he stood there diversely distracted,
with these doubtful thoughts, he was aduertized by his houskeeper, who had
inquired the matter of the Carters, that the stuff was his sister Dobsons, who
with her husband and children she said, was come to make her remain and
dwelling there with him, and who, as she was making this report, came in at
the gate, her husband and children with her. But sir Thomas not alitle
estranging at the news, backened to the Carremen to stay the unloading of
their carts, till he came forth to meet his sister at the doors, of whom
demanding the cause of her coming after such a sort, he was informed of his
house keepers embassage sent to her, wherewith he was very much offended,
causing them all to come into the house and dine: with good and fair speeches
he entreated her to return to her own home again, with assured promise that
he would provide sufficiently for her, and the residue of his friends: and
for the better security thereof, because that imprudently they had leased away
their Farm, he presently gave to her husband the moytie of a tithe he held
amounting to ten pounds a year, until such time as their own Farm should
fall unto them again: and also he took from them their eldest son, George
Dobson, whom he adopted for his own, and brought up at School in Durham,
to whose course of life and merry ieasts, we will direct the tract ensuing,
licencing his mother well contented with her brothers benevolence, to return
to the country again with her husband, and other children.

NOw is George Dobson taken from his mothers lap, and left to the care and
providence of his uncle sir Thomas, who perceiving his disposition knauish,
thought good in time to hoope him in before he fell to licking: and knowing,
that while the twigge is young and tender, it is also flexible, to keep him
from other waggish turns, he judged it the best course to set him to the
Schools: and in regard himself used to go twice every day unto the Minster,
he could not so well attend him, as his wildness required: and fearing
again, that his foolish love toward him might induce him to forbear
correction when he well deserved the same, and the neglect thereof was a
certain mean for ever to undo him, he rather determined to send him to the
Church of Saint Nicholas amongst other little children of the City, where he
had not been three days, but he falling at variance with a Merchants son
of the same town that was his school fellow, he burst his lantern book all
to pieces, and the boys forehead was so sore, that the blood ran about his
ears, neither could they stay it, but conducted him home to his mother, who
when she saw the blood of her little son, she well-neere fell into a
sown, and had suncke to the earth, if she had not been supported by her
husband, who after he had well viewed it, assured her that the boy was nothing
the worse, and then sending for a Surgeon, caused him to stay the bleeding, and
to plaster the sore: but albeit there was hope of amendment, yet when the
mother knew after what manner it was done, she bitterly raged against poor
Dobson, causing, not only his School master severely to correct him, but
attending sir Thomas his coming from the Cathedral Church, who was to pass
by her shop, she made a grievous complaint to him against his Nephew,
bringing her son to the view, and showed him the greatness of the sore, and
after a woman's manner, whose anger is implacable, and whose revenge is
measurelesse, she told sir Thomas, that unless he did punish his nephew for
the fact, she would have him debarred of coming any more to school there,
either the master, if he received him, she would have extruded from his place.
Sir Thomas in good speeches praying her to be satisfied, promised to perform
her desire, and if she mistrusted his word, if so it seemed good to her, he
offered to give him the law in her presence. But she told him, no, that he
should not, for she nothing doubted the fulfilling of his promise, and that
she did not seek his affliction by way of revenge, but that he might thereby
be warned and deterred from doing so any more, and so seemed to request him to
do it discreetely and without bitterness: sir Thomas made few more replies,
but made haste home to welcome his new guest with the whippe: and though he
were sorry for the childs hurt, yet he could not but laugh in his mind, at
the knavery of his Nephew, and the chollericke stomach of the Merchants wife,
poor Dobson nothing at all thinking of further conflictes, lamenting only the
breaking of his book, for which he not a little sorrowed what answer to make
to his uncle: to lie, he esteemed it the worst course that could be, for he
knew his uncle would sift forth the truth, and if he should be taken with a
false report, he was assured to be purged thereof with no less than with the
best blood in his breath: so, not able to bethink himself of a reasonable
excuse, he wept no less than for his beating received at his Masters hands,
exspecting a sharper penance. His master observing him still to continue in
tears, demanded of him why he further wept, to whom he bewrayed his fears,
and the cause thereof. His Master moved to compassionate his case, and
deeming it injustice to have him two times punished for one offense, he sent
for alittle glue, repaired his book, and writ to his uncle all the
circumstaunces of what had happened, defiring him to remit unto him this first
little delict, and to content himself with such punishment as he already had
inflicted upon him. Dobson humbly thanking his Master for this unlooked for
benignity, as blithe as Bird on M(...)
briar, posteth home with his warrant in his pocket, but he was no sooner
entered into the Hall, and had broken a courtesy to his uncle while he did
epsy upon the Table hollie wandes in water, cold cates, God wot, to stay
his empty stomach withal. His uncle taking one of them into his hand,
said: Now good sir, where have you bestowed your self this day, that you stay
so late abroad? Good uncle, replied Dobson with a sober and demure
countenance, casting his eyes upon the ground, I have been at the School.
Have you so? says sir Thomas* I pray then lets see your book, and how much
you have learned all this day? With that poor Dobson breathed forth a
pitteous sigh, and with a pensive heart and trembling hands he pulled his
patched book forth of his pocket, at which sight his uncle not able to
contain himself from smiling, turning away that he might not be perceived,
laughed a good space: afterward reflecting his looks upon his lamentable
nephew, down whose cheeks the tears streamed. My boy, said he, I pray
thee, who has made thee a Joyner? me thinks thou have taken thy book in
sunder, and have made it to stand upon joints, whereas in the morning it
appeared unto me to be all one piece* without chincke, joint, or member,
otherwise my sight deceived me: then Dobson prostrating himself, humbly prayed
his uncle of pardon, and made true relation of the conflict passed betwixt him
and his fellow, and that whatsoever he had done, it was in his own defense,
adding moreover, that his Master had already given him due punishment for his
trespass, and therewithal he pulled forth his Masters note, and delivered
it to his uncle, the subject whereof agreed wholly with his report, and had
undoubtedly procured his pardon, if he had not remembered his promise before
made to the Merchaunts wife, whereupon he caused poor Dobson to untruss, and
to offer his breech to the block, which he soundly lashed, and the next
morrow carrying him unto the Merchants wife, caused him to ask both her and
her son forgiveness, who pardoning him, he was sent again to the School,
with charge to keep the peace with his fellows, lest he drunk of the whippe
again.

How the Boys of the School caused George Dobson to be whipped for their
fault. Chap. III.
THus is George Dobson (as you have heard) sent again to the School, where
he had not long continued but that he preceeded the most part of his
fellows, who long before him had been sent thither, to his uncles great
content and pleasure, who at all times warned him to beware of playing the
wagge, and of quarrelling with his fellows, threatening him, that if he so ill
carried himself, he would for ever eiect and turn him out of the doors,
whereas otherwise, if as a duetifull boy he would apply his books, and would
also conform himself to the disposition of his fellows, and with them would
live in unity and concord, he should not then want any manner of thing
convenient to his estate and calling, but that after his death he would make
him his sole heir, and possess him of all his lands, leases, farms, and
hereditaments. The boy was very attentive to his uncles exhortations, and
conceived well, that such advise and counsel much concerned his health and
welfare, and therefore (to his power) he put them in execution, behauing and
demeaning himself very respectively, both in the presence of his uncle, and
abroad: ever standing in doubt, that if he should commit any thing
vnapproouable, that the same might come to his uncles knowledge, and if so, he
were then for ever undone. But notwithstanding all his care, which was mere
acquisi^e and not habitual, as affirms the old Proverb, That which is bred
in the bone, will not forth of the flesh: Naturam expellas furca licet vsque
recurret.

He must needs go whom the devil drives: and whose fortune it is to be
strangled, certain it is he shall never drown: So albeit George Dobson
studied by all possible means to perform all his uncles pleasures and
commandments, yet for his life he could not accomplish them, so many blocks
were set for him to stumble upon, for naturally he was of a crabbed and
untoward disposition, and so rustike like, that he could not cover his clownish
and wayward manners with the habit of ciuility, and in regard of his rude and
ill favored gestures, antique tricks, and apish toys, his Schoolefellowes
many times took occasion to deride, scorn, and laugh at him: whereof he
being very impatient, and not daring with clubbe and fist to revenge it, lest
thereby he should procure his uncles indignation, for excessive grief, anger
and sorrow, he would wrinckle his brows, whet his teeth, and pull the hairs
from his head, which he would scatter and throw abroad in frantic manner.
And if it had not been more for the fear he had to loose his uncles favor,
than the whipping he assured himself would ensue the combat, the most part
of them had felt the weight of his fists. But the respect of his uncles love
and affection moved him to bear so long, until his heart was like to break
with discontent. The boys of the City playing upon this advantage,
especially his Schoolefellowes, knowing him to be bred in the Country, banded
themselves together, made no less to do about him, than the other birds do
of the Owl at noonetime, if they catch her abroad in the wooddes; they
omitted no opportunity to disgrace him, either by riming, or railing upon him,
and with every other despite their waggish brains could devise, they abused
him: many times they would forge matters of disorder, thereby to incense their
master against him, yea and most times when themselves had committed the
faults worthy of correction, they would thrust the blame upon him. And
although he had ever wit enough to discharge and clear himself of their
accusations, by the inference of diverse probabilities of the contrary: yet,
because they were a multitude, and he only one, their testimony was allowed,
and he assuredly sustained the punishment, because the fact done, and their
witness improoued him, he not being able in particular to convict any of them
of the offense. And in the winter eeuenings they enacted many a lewd stratageme
about the shoppes in their way to the School, as bursting glasen wind^wes,
overthrowing Milk maids pailes, pulling down stalles, and crushing out the
linckes which were hung forth to give light to the Passengers in the streets.
And whenever they were pursued by any of the persons house or family to whom
these injuries were done, they had decreed that some should betake themselves
to flight, as accessory and guilty of the trespass, and that some others
should abide, as nothing consenting to the act, and willingly should reveal
and nominate the parties offending, which whosoever they were, only Dobson was
the man standered, though both innocent and ignorant, yet ever upon the next
morrow, the law proceeded, the case was determined against him, and he was
found guilty by the general verdict of the Jury. And to conclude, he upon
every such occasion suffered always the punishment that others had deserved:
and these centriuings of his felows were so continual, that they made him
almost weary of his life, and so desperate in the end, that he became in
respect thereof, that he resolved rather than any further to tolerate this
mis-vsage, either to run his country, or to forsake his friends and their
company, either to set at naught his uncles injunctions, and as he could
catch any of them alone, whose malice he perceived to be endless against him,
to pay them their debts in a devils name. Long he rested doubtful whether
course to make choice of, and after much discuss and consideration, he
conceived, that to relinquish his uncle and other his friends in such a sort,
were not his best booty, for one way he should thereby deprive himself of all
their kind effection, and do more damage and disgrace to them all, and his
own good name, than all their mischeeuous devises could be able to effect.
Because the rumor of his departure, spreading it self through all parts of the
Town, would make the people susped him accessory of some notorious trespass
done against his uncle, and for fear of punishment so to have exiled
himself: either that his uncle might be a shrewd and curious man, for
strictly handling him, and that to avoid his austerity and hard usage, he had
thus put himself to flight, either of which conceits he collected might be
prejudicial to them both. Again, whither to run or direct his course, he
knew not, unless it were home to his mother, who he was persuaded would
return him back with a very vengeance. And then (said he) with what face
can I look upon my uncle, or any other person of my acquaintance? And to go
to any other place, alas who will entertain or receive me, every stranger
will suppose the truth, that I am run from my friends, and that therefore I
am the more apt to do the same from them, If I shall taste any asperitie or
eagre usage, this will be their imagination of me, and heereuppon every man will
be afraid to admit me into his house, and what then will ensue of me? If not,
either to starve, beg, or steal: so that this course, upon these
considerations, he rejected, as in no case to be prosecuted. And for the
other, to fall to fisty cuffes, to give them as good as they brought, and to pay
them home their loan, with usury, though his stomach served well thereto,
and his desire to deal his alms amongst them in such a sort, was no less
than to his dinner, yet he apprehended diverse inconveniences imminent thereupon
to ensue, to wit, his Masters reward, which could be no less worth than
twenty lashes, at every time he should hazard for it, and the enmity of his
fellows, and the worst that they could do unto him besides he was to exspect.
But both these two were in his cut already, and as a man would say,
predestinate unto him before either coat or shert. And therefore seeing it was
his destiny, and a thing inevitable, it was as good to have some play for his
money, he thought, as to give it away gratis. But then to curb this resolution
came to his remembrance, the loss of his uncles goodwill and affection, if he
should so violate his commandment, and do against his own promise: nay, at
his uncles hands he looked for no better than either utter eiection, or the
seuerest punishment he could inflict. What shall then poor Dobson determine to
do in the midst of so many extremes, never a one whereof has any medium?
Alas poor soul says he to himself, and is there no remedy, but either like
a patient Ass I must apply my back to support all the burdens of my
contumelious fellows scorns, derisions, abusings, and forgeries, together
with my masters merciless and unjust punishments, and the peoples undeserved
exclamations, or else needs must I take me to my heels, and* so run away,
making my feet worth two pair of hands, and my self guilty of some filthy
crime, never so much as once thought upon by me: or shall I stand unto the
matter, and turn again like a man, and purchase my liberty, although with
the expense of the dearest blood in my breath, and perhaps with the loss of
my uncles favor, who if he weigh well my cause, or could understand how I am
forced thercunto, and that my revenge is but equal and just, has no reason to
be offended with me for such action. And certainly, of all other it is my most
honorable decree, neither is he so austere, stern, or scarce of good nature,
but that reason will persuade him, and for once I will attempt him: The other
courses are not only euilles, but ignominious, and where all are
inconveniences, it is well allowed, that I make choice of the least in
appearance: and heerewith he settled his purpose, that the next time they
occasioned him by any of their accustomd practices, or set any new snare
wherein to catch him, he would hazard to hang some of them by the neck, if he
could.

Long it was not before they thus consulted against him: in the City near
unto the gate called Chapel Bar, was dwelling a Haverdasher, who had a very
fair wife, and as it was also reported, a merry disposed wench, a good
companion among Gallants, when she could procure her husbands absence, either
get a gossiping. All the crew of Venus attendants hearing tell of her beauty,
witle, and good fellowship, repaired to her company, supplicating for Loves
trophies, and the spoil of her honesty, whereof (as the rumor went) she was
no great niggard, yet amongst all the number, she most affected a Butcher of
the City, and her next neighbor, who the more to content her humor,
continued in a Batchellors estate, though a man, of personage very proper, and
much desired of a multitude of Maids in the city, who spared not (so far
as modesty permitted) to solicit his love. But he reserved their
exspectations, therewithal to applaude the contents of this gallant Dame, and
she (as it was generally coniectured) used him with no less kindness than
her husband, affoording to him all his desires as opportunities served her
thereunto: and so often as her husband had occasions to absent himself, by
reason of his going to Faires and Markets and other like necessary business
in the Country, she would give intelligence thereof to the Butcher, who never
failed to supply her defect in every point, as if he had been the Haberdasher:
Their familiarity and acquaintance, at the length, grew so public, that every
corner of the City was silled with the report thereof, and most men esteemed
the Haberdasher free merchant in Cuckolds row: But she standing upon the
Pantophles of her honesty, thought scorn to be told that Buckes had horns,
or that Tauernes were taken open Innes, and therefore, so often as she was
trodden upon the toes, as diverse times in quarrels with her neighbors she was
let to understand how the verdite passed as concerning her honesty, she would
forsooth persuade her husband that it was a sufficient action to call such
persons before the Chancellor of the Spiritualties, and either in the public
Court to prove what they had slaundered her withal, or they failing therein,
should forthwith be constrained to make her lawful satisfaction for so
injurious costs and charges.

And this she continually suggested her husband unto, not upon the knowledge
of her innocence, but only of purpose to cloud the poor cuckoldes eye-fight,
and that under this pretext and challenge, she might insinuate her self into
her husbands good conceit, and the better cloak her knaueries: and by these
glorious shows and painted devises, she so much prevailed with him, that he
really believing that she was a mirror of true modesty, and envied only by her
neighbors, because she exceeded them in beauty, whereby he thought some
iealousies they had lest she might allure from them their devoted serui^ours
and affected friends, he walked on forward like a snaile with a house on her
head, who no sooner looks forth, but her horns are espied, the poor fool
therefore relying more confidence in his wifes flatteries, who notwithstanding
all her brauadoes, would have been very loath that matters should have come to
the scanning: then his neighbors certain and assured conjectures supposing
his wife to be one of those innocent souls, who were inturiously slaundered
and persecuted for her conscience sake, caused two honest matrons of the city,
the one a Draper, the other an Apothecaries wife, to be sommoned before she
Commissary, and there, either to make good such scandalous and opprobrious
speeches, as lately in their fallings out they had taxed her with all: not
being able to manifest the same, he desired the Commissary that they might be
enjoined to ask his wife forgiveness, in the Court, Church, and market, in part
of satisfaction for her credit and good name, so depraved and brought in
question. But alas poor man, he had forgot that the more the dirt is stirred,
the greater stinch it yeeldes, and that whereas before he was but suspected to
be a cuckold, that now, if it were in their power to prove it certain, they
would rather do it, than hazard the penalty of the law: But he, I say,
nothing mistrusting his wifes defense was very earnest in the master, and so
hotly pressed them, as they could not avoid him without their own prejudice,
until they made apparent by such instances, as his wife was not able to
improoue, and themselves blushed to produce, that he was one of them to whom
the bird in May sings the double note, cuckoo. So when the case was
substantially discussed, and sentence to be given, the two matrons were
discharged free, and he confirmed a cuckold by the order of the Court.

Hereupon such poetical brains as were resident in the City, to whom
intelligence was given of the circumstances, rymed upon the Haberdashers
fortune, and his wifes behavior, the Schoole-boyes sung ballads thereof in
every street, and for nine days there was no talk in request, but to
discourse how the Haberdasher was knighted. The waggish mates who were Dobsons
fellow scholars set their heads together, devising how they might procure him
the block, which they did think might easily be effected, if they could
contriue any pageant, whereby to bewray the Haberdashers disgrace, and impose
it upon him: for their master was so much his friend, that he would not spare
any of them to satisfy him for any offense by them committed to his dishonor,
and so at last they concluded, some night, when the streets were at quiet, and
none to disturb them, they would fasten to the appendix over the Haberdashers
door a pair of bulls horns, with a pageant betwixt them, wherein they caused
to be painted a man in his shop selling hattes, and a Butcher in a parlour
with his wife, his one arm folding and embrating her about the middle, and in
his other hand he held a mastiffe dog in a string. Over their heads was hanging
the similitude of a bird singing upon a howthorne, and on his crest he had
curiously portrayed a red and green bunch of feathers like a comb, forth
of the which sprowted a fair pair of seemly horns, of a branded color.
This they got set on by the help of a Smith of their acquaintance, and who
bare some tooth against the poor Haberdasher, that so bolstered the head of
his hammer, that it forced in the nail, without any noise making: And
underneath the pageant they placed these few lines written in parchment as
follows, subscribing George Dobsons name thereunto.

Who hattes is here disposde to buy,
These horns to him such hap escry,
That here no hattes are to be sold,
Unless it be for some cuckolde.
Such is the master of this shop,
Such shall they be that with him choppe
Or change an old hatte for a new,
His bargain he may happly rue.
When on his brows are to be seen,
Such horns as these and them between:
These glorious ensigns of a knight,
Who perished his weapons in a fight,
Which he commenst against his wife,
With whom he had a doubtful strife:
But she got victory on the morn,
And reard these trophies up in scorn,
His feeble fight for to bewray,
Who played the coward, and ran away:
If he deny this to be true,
The Chancery Rolls can to you show.
That he adjudged is to be,
A cuckold of the best degree:
And we as Heraults him assign
These arms, for now, and after time.
Thus is he bounden to his friends,
That to him such great favor lends:
But you (good cuckold) take your sleep,
The Butchers dog your door does keep:
And when you ride to Hexam fair,
The master will himself be there.
And thus wishing all health to your horns, I bid you good morrow, George
Dobson.


When these brave wagges had performed all these their devises, for that
instant they went every man his way home to bed; on the next morrow, it being
sunday, the Haberdasher and his family kept their beds longer than on the
week days they had been accustomed, not having any greater business to go
about before feruice time, than only to make their masters apparel ready,
and wearied with ouer-labouring themselves the week precedent, they slept it
out till half hour past seven, all which time the doors being shutt, the
sign of the horn gave a glorious show to the passengers that came by, whereof
there was good store that morning, for it was at that instant the week wherein
the Assizes were holden at Dunholme, and the Town (in regard thereof) was full
of strangers: no man passed by but he surueighed the ignominy of the poor
Haberdasher, reading the verses underset so many as could, others that had no
skill in letters, got them perused by such as could, and as they understood
the contents, every man blessed his forehead from the Haberdasher and his
hattes, laughing apace, and making good sport at the conceit of the jest.
After a while, the last come of his apprentices, whose custom was to be first
up, and to make the fires, hearing such noise and concourse of people about the
shop, came hastily rushing to the doors, and vnbolting the same, set them
open, to see what the stir might be: but as the doors fell open, he might
easily perceive the cause of such assembling of the people, and as one
distracted with this sudden aspect, he stood amongst them as one who at the
sight of Gorgons head had thereby been transformed into a pillar of stone: the
people laughed a good deal the more at his astonishment, whereby the poor
boys amazement and shame increased: but recollecting his spirits, he paced up
the stairs to his masters chamber, where he was in bed with his honest
mistress, by whose careful endeavor he was promoted to the order of the forked
knights, whose scutchion and coat armor is the bugle horn. The Haberdasher
nothing less exspecting, was by his apprentice informed of all what was to be
seen: at the relation whereof he leaped forth of his bed, reaching to his
sword, which hung besides him in the chamber, and casting only his gown about
him, without any other clothes, he ran down the stairs, as a man newly
bereft of his wits, and infurious and most terrible manner assaulting the
horns, he all to batterd and cut them from the doors, and tearing off the
scrowle, he rent it into pieces: at which spectacle the people were ready to
die with laughing. But the Haberdasher having got the field, and given his
enemies the overthrow, not so much as bidding his neighbors good morrow, he
returned again into his house, so afflicted with shame and grief, as all that
day he could not acquiet himself, but fared up and down like a bedlam,
exclaiming against his wife, and accursing the time wherein he came first
acquainted with her, thus (by her lewd and naughty carriage) to become the
scorn of the world: but she with gentle and calm speeches sought to temper
his passions, praying him to pardon what was past, and she would vow and
promise for ever hereafter, to live so soberly and so modestly, as he should
think himself sufficiently satisfied for her former misdemeanour: and further
also she persuaded him not to permit so shameful a disgrace to pass
unrevenged, and therefore she moved him to charge sir Thomas with the same
before the Deane and Chapter of the house, assuring him, that they would
enforce him upon his conscience to disclose so much as he knew thereof, for
(said she) albeit the boy be very waggish, and apt enough to execute so much
knavery as he can bethink, yet do I not persuade my self that he could invent
this, and hang it up in such a sort, without the assistance of some more subtle
brain than his own, and therefore sir Thomas being accused thereof before his
masters, will either confess the same upon their iniunction and command, (if
he have been a factor therein:) or otherwise, if he be ignorant, yet shall he
be urged (for his own discharge) to constrain his nephue to unfold the truth
of the whole matter.

The poor fool not considering that this course was still a mean to publish
and divulge his further infamy, followed his wives advice, and waited his time
without acquainting sir Thomas of his intent, he repaired to the Deane at such
time, when he and the residue of the prebends were assemblsd in their
Chapter House, to confer of certain leases to be demised, and the reformation
of some disorders in the Churchmen: he being admitted into the Chapter house,
requested M. Deanes and their favors, desiring that sir Thomas might be
called before them, that he might liberally disbursse his mind, and freely lay
open his grief withal, beseeching them that according to their accustomed
sincerity and pious considerations, they would grant him justice against sir
Thomas, so far as the equity of his cause might seem to require, which they
promised to do; and sending for sir Thomas, who immediately presented himself,
they willed the Habberdasher to proceed with what he had to say who amply
related at large the setting up of the horns, with the scrowles annexed, and
the shame he sustained thereby, and adding, he said; sir Thomas this was
either properly your own act, or otherwise it was done by your direction, for
unto the scrole was subscribed the name of your nephew, George Dobson: and
therefore good master Deane (said he) let sir Thomas be enjoined to show his
purpose therein, and to make me amends, or I shall complain upon you all to
higher powers, who I trust will remedy my case, and afford me law and justice
against you all, for the neglect of my satisfaction; for you ought to instruct
such ignorant people (as my self) not only by good and wholesome doctrine,
but also by the example of a holy and godly life, and it has not been heard of
in any man's age, that ever any such abuse has been devised by any of the
Clergy, as this which has been practiced upon me: and therefore I sue to you
M. Deane, and the rest of your brotherhood, that I, as I am publicly
disgraced thereby, so at the next time of the Sessions, sir Thomas in the face
of the Judges of Assizes, and the people there assembled, shall confess his
misdoing, and upon his knees shall ask me and my wife forgiveness, for
certainly, I am persuaded, that albeit his Nephew seems to take it unto him,
yet can it be no other, then sir Thomas his devise: for which (I say) if you
do not constrain him in this form to satisfy me, I shall speak shame of
you all, and assure my self that you have been all thereunto assenting as
much as he, and herewith in a great chafe he was ready to depart, without
hearing of Sir Thomas his reply, either M. Deanes verdict, who laughed full
heartily at the Habberdashers impatience, and his hot inuectiue made against
sir Thomas. But dissembling it as much as possibly he could, covering his face
with his gown sleeue, he entreated the Habberdashers placable audience, till
sir Thomas had made answer to his objection; wherein if he did not fully
discharge and acquit himself, he swore to him upon his holiness, that both
sir Thomas, and his Nephew likewise should undergo, either that, or any other
penance: notwithstanding (said M. Deane) that I could wish, you would admit of
some other satisfaction more to your own commodity, and with more safe escape
of your credit. For say that sir Thomas should perform all that you desire,
yet if therebe any cause of probability, that your wife has faulted to you,
though but in suspect amongst your neighbors, yet this action ministering
occasion to strangers to make inquiry of the matter amongst their
acquaintances in the town, and shall thereby understand their censures and
opinions, it will but make the infamy the more notorious, that he does it upon
Iniunction, and fear lest that if he should refuse so to do, he should be
deprived of his Benefices and disgraded: others will conjecture, that he does
it the more to notify your disgrace, and your wifes ill demeanor, to the end
that she perceiving her shame to be published, may be forced to correct her
carriage; for unless my memory do fail me, I understand by the Chancellor of
our spiritnallties, that too much has been proved against her. And if sir
Thomas then should first acknowledge the setting up of the said horns which
stuffeth this your stomach, and it can digest no better course but revenge, and
after that he has made the same acknowledgement, shall reply and infer, that
he has done no more then has been proved in open Court, to be due to such
dishonest dealings, and shall also adduce the same Testificants, that were
witnesses against her in the Chancery, where will then your amends be had,
shall not then your matter be worse then at the beginning?, yea certainly. But
howsoever, I am very willing that you have justice, and whatsoever penalty the
law will impose for so indigne an action if he cannot clear himself he shall
abide it, but it is conuenientt we put him to his purgation, and hear what
answer he can make, and turning his face toward sir Thomas, he thus framed his
speech.

I do not a little marvel, that you sir Thomas, should show yourselfe so
scarce of reason, or civility; nay, so void of the fear of God and the
respect of your function, and the good estimate of us all, whose credites must
needs be blemished, if you have had a hand herein, or meddled in such
irreligious complots, to the utter defamation of any person, with such hazard
of there lives and souls. For if on the shame thereof they had laid violent
hands on them selves, desperately killed each other, what a horrible sin had you
been guilty of and attaint? I grant it is your office, Vitia improbare,
turpitudinem, redarguere, and fratrem peccantem admonere: but it is to be done
Suauiter and sine amaritudine, and with Noah's blessed son we must rather take
the mantle from our own backs, to cover therewith our brothers nakedness,
then with wicked Cham, lay open our fathers shame to the view of the world;
which if we do, we are to expect no better reward then was his, to wit, the
malediction of our heavenly and celestial father, and therefore without
inference of many circumstances, if you be guilty I do charge you upon your
conscience, Priesthood, and the duty you owe unto God and our fellowship, in
a word sincerely to confess it, and if you be ignorant thereof or not
assenting thereto, your oath shall suffice to satisfy both us and this honest
man; and therewith he caused a book to be carried to sir Thomas, whereupon he
deposed as follows: By the contents of this holy Bible, by the love I owe
unto Almighty God, and by my obedience unto this place and society, upon the
integrity of my conscience, and the honor of my Priesthood: I am innocent of
every paticular wherewith this man charge me, and this is the first time that
ever I heard of it. And also I protest, that if my Nephew have been an Agent
herein, I shall first give him such punishment as he has deserved, and after I
shall exclude and renounce him for ever: and therewith he kissed the book, and
surrendered it again. Whereat good man Goose was clean quatted, and not able
to bring any further proof, departed a more known cuckolde than before, and
so continued all his life long.

Sir Thomas being also dismissed from the Chapter house, could not be contented
until he had further inquired of this matter, and so going to the school, he
examined his nephew of the same, in the presence of his master, and the
scholars, of whom there were diverse, which did evidence against him, both
falsely, and upon malice, especially they who were the principal offenders, as
a Tanner and Painters sons, who faced him down, that he bespoke them to
provide him of the signs which were set up, and which they (mistrusting no
such matter) affoorded him. But hereunto he answered with an undaunted courage,
that they injuriously belyed him, and alleged so many reasons as his childish
brain could propound to improoue their assertions, but no reason would excuse
him, their testimony was allowed, and he sharply beaten, which he not knowing
how to avoid, he took patiently for the time, yet he protested that he was
not only innocent, but ignorant of the matter, and resolved, that seeing it
was so, that it was all one with him, to be a thief, and to be but only
suspected, he altered his purpose as Ployden did the Case, revenged his own
injuries, without respect of either his uncles pleasures, or his masters
punishments, and so that day in their going home to dinner, he dealt his
benevolence, and paid so soundly his false witnesses, that he caused them to
sing miserere, and before his uncle to confess the truth of the matter, and
their principal intent. Whereof his uncle much rejoicing, and understanding
his innocence, moved them to declare the same before their master, first
taking his promise to pardon their offense: for (says he) their
acknowledgement shall free them from punishment, which their master granting,
they unfolded every circumstance, which he particularly related again to
master Deane and the prebends, who much commending his nephew, willed sir
Thomas to place him at the singing school, and promised, that so soon as he
could keep any consort, or bear a part, they would benefice him in the
Cathedral. For which he humbly thanking them, departed home in great content
and peace of mind.

How Dobson revenged the quarrel of his friend upon the Usher. Chap. 4.
GEorge Dobson, every day after this, so long as he continued at the reading
school entered the lists, and fought the combat with some one or other of his
fellows, wherein fortune so much favored him, as she always granted him
victory, and he brought them unto such slavery and subjection, that howsoever
he used them, complain they durst not, unless the hurt were so apparent as
that it could not be covered from their masters sight, neither then upon
examination dared any of them tax him therewith, unless himself did confess
the matter, which he always did with such dexterity, as he always
sufficiently discharged himself, and thrust the blame upon the party iniuried,
whereunto no man used any contradiction: and the master, in respect he had
found forth their practices against him in former time, the rather took his
word, and the less believed them, whereby ensued to him a great deal of
quiet: for they seeing him so stand to himself, man forth his own matter, and
the master so much on his side, that it was not possible to separate him from
his good conceived opinion, by little and little they desisted from further
abusing him, contenting themselves with only laughing at him in secret. His
uncle also became so hopeful of his well doing, that he likewise turned a
deaf ear to all complaints that came against him, imagining that such were
rather urged of malice, as in former times than upon any desert, and so when
as he could perfitly write and read, he removed him thence to the singing
school, where he profited so well, that in short time he was fit for a
Choristers rowme, which to him was granted upon the first motion made, the
Deane himself installed him, and of his own proper charge furnished him with
gown and surplesse, commanding his uncle to reserve the benefit of his place
for his preferment to the university of Cambridge or Oxford, when he should be
sufficient to be sent thither. His uncle no small man in regard Master Deane
so much respected his nephew, fitted him of every thing convenient to his
estate, not permitting him to want any thing that the boy would demand or say
was needeful: and perceiving his uncle so much to dote upon him, he played the
wagge with more liberty then before, and being grown up to a good sturdy
ladde, he first so handled the matter, that he became captain of Schools,
and so hampered the whole multitude as no man dared to offend him, but studied
by all possible means to inuest themselves into his favor and friendship,
whereof they being possessed, thought themselves as sure as if they had been
shutt up in Warke castle, for to his favorites none presumed to offer injury,
or make complaint upon them, neither the Usher adventured to punish for what
offense soever; but by his conniuency, so much he feared his displeasure,
whereof he had upon occasions tasted, and having been once under him at
shrift, he found him so strict in the imposition of penance, that he never
desired afterward to use him any more for a ghostly father, and the matter came
thus to effect. There was in the school one Raikebanes, whom Dobson highly
loved, and more esteemed of, than of all other fellows, both in regard he was
borne in the country, and also for that his manners and conditions were more
correspondent to his humor than any others in that place: This Raikebaines one
day when he supposed that they should have license so pastime themselves in the
fields, brought with him to the school his artillery, purposing to bestow that
after noone in shooting, but his exspectations proved frustrate, for their
superior Master Bromeley was at the same instant by his acquaintance invited
into the town to a banquet, where he conceiving to be longer detained from
school than he could have wished, referred to the usher the whole charge
thereof, taking with him only Debson, because he was a pleasantly disposed
guest, and apt to incite laughing, as also having a tunable voice to assist
him, if his company called for a Song, the Usher set in the top of his triumph,
to manifest his authority, was so precise, that at no entreaty of gentlemen he
would condescend to let the scholars go abroad, notwithstanding diverse of
good respect made suit for the same* all of whom he shakd off with an absolute
denial; but some of them scorning to be too importunate, either to have him
think that they respected to rest beholden to him for so simple a favor, sent
to master Bromeley himself, who willingly assented to their requests and
dismissed the scholars, notwithstanding master Usher his repugnancie to the
contrary, and albeit that the day was far gone before they were set at
liberty, yet Raikebaines procured some of his best acquaintances to spend so
much thereof as remained in shooting.

And returning home toward night, in a valley betwixt the river and the wood,
which banketh the river all along as it enuironeth the city, he espied M.
Usher at his meditations, whose presence his stomach was not able to digest
for that he had so peremptorily abridged them of that days recreation. And so
speaking to his companions, by my truth (says he) I discover a Woodcocke by
the water side, and I could find in heart to pick his head to the bones, and
give my dogs his flesh, so do I love him, I would I were in France, upon
condition his nose were of equal sise with a natural woodcocks bill, I should
make a commodity of his picture, I am assured, if not of the real substance:
Well sir William, though I be not of strength sufficient to deal with you at
handy strokes, and beat wit into your wooden head, yet my heart is good enough
to hazard with you at the spears point: and as Hercules, unable with speed
of foot to overtake the Centaure, running away with his fairest Deinira, sent a
messenger to stay him till his coming; so my self acknowledging my
imbecillitie and weakness to dis-inable me to close with you in arms, will
nevertheless fight afar off, and dispatch my post, by whose speedy blast,
you shall be let to understand how dearly I affect you: and therewithal
pulling an arrow from under his girdle, he sent it with a right good will, to
bid sir William good Euensong, which lighting upon the shirt of his gown
behind, only feared him without any further harm. But he turning about, and
seeing from whence the flight was sent, set himself back to meet them at the
bridge foot, where making inquiry of the matter, the whole case was unfolded
and Rackebains attainted.

The next morrow he complained to M. Bromley, and caused poor lames to be
lashed, at which Dobson storming made no great exterior show, yet purposed in
heart to take a condign revenge upon sir William when opportunity served,
which he performed within a short time after, as you shall hear.

Sir William had a chamber near to M. Deanes own lodging, and the fore-doore
opening into the great yard, (commonly called the Abbey garth, it had also a
back door, by the which he might pass through M. Deanes kitchen garden into
the Cathedral, as also when it pleased him to take the benefit of the same,
there he might walk, or exercise any other recreation by M. Deanes license,
who for that he esteemed him a very honest young man, and a painful in school
matters, authorized him to use the easement thereof: in a corner of this Garden
was built a house for M. Deane his Poultrie, where he had always great store
feeding for his provision, both Turkies, Capons, Fezants, and other of like
sort. Dobson therefore upon this injury done to his friend, continually
troubled his brain for revenge, and after aduisements, he supposed he could no
way so sufficiently come quit with him, as to devise some mean whereby to
procure him M. Deanes alienation of good will, and loss of good liking; being
therefore very intimate and familiar with the Boy that attended him in his
chamber, he was particularly informed of sir Williams whole course and
demeanor, and of all the benefits of his lodging. Dohson then thinking that in
respect sir William only had access into this garden, that if he could draw
the boys assent unto the practice of any knavery, either in the garden or
about the Poultrie, that there might be occasions good enough to set master
Deanes stomach against him became so entire with the boy as in short space he
promised to concur with Dobson for the making up of any jest, that might
not tend to his own extreme prejudice, and his masters utter infamy. For
which Dobson protesting to regratiate both him, and to have care of the
circumstances, lay still in wait, when he might take sir William napping, or
fittely effect any thing whereby to work him some notable shame; in the winter
time when a snow fell, he came to the Chamberlain desiring him to afford him
a pair of sir William shoes, and that the same night when sir William should
be asleep, that he would suffer him to enter the wooddeyard, where (says he)
I will be so hardy as to take away one of master Deanes fattest Turkies,
wherewith we will make merry and laugh in some convenient place in the town. O
God forbid said the Chamberer, for when the Turkey is wanting they will
straight suspect me, because I only, and my master the Deanes Poulterer
excepted, have recourse into that place, and for my master they know him
honest enough, neither will they conceive any jealousy of him, but presently
they will accuse and also cause me to be punished. Not so quoth Dobson, for to
prevent them therein I desire to have sir Williams shoes, that they may see
that the print left in the snow is of a man's foot, not of a boys, which
sight will assuredly acquit thee: and knowing sir Williams honesty in all
former times, they will be brought to that exigent, that they shall not know
what to do or say: and hereupon they will be enforced to conceal it, lest if
accusing thy master, the blame be thrust upon themselves. The boy loath to
displease Dobson, or to hazard his goodwill, condiscended to his desires, lent
him a pair of his masters shoes, and at his time appointed permitted him to
have free passage through the house into the woodyard, from whence he took
away the fattest Turkey to his knowledge, and quietly conueying him by the same
passage, leaving the shoes with the boy in the Chamber, he carried the Turkey
to be dressed in the town at a Cooks house of his acquaintance, wherewith he
feasted such of his friends as he made choice of, laughing to consider how he
intended to blonke sir William: so when the morning came he conveyed himself
betimes to his uncles chamber, which was also in the same court, and had one
window lighting into the same woodyard, thither he secretly conveyed himself
to attend the Poulterers coming to serve his birds, who about his ordinary
time came to bring them meat, and to see if he had all his number, where he
missed (by the head) the Turkey that was stolen. This want being extraordinary,
amazed him: and he could not devise how it should come to pass, if either
some weasell, stot, or poulecat had not devoured her. But then again he
considered that so little a beast could not so dispatch him, but that there
would have been left some remainders; neither could he discern which way any
such vermin could have access unto that place. To think that he was stolen,
was but a mere imagination, as he supposed, since there was no way left to
thieves, so that what to censure aright he was altogether ignorant.

But while that he stood in this doubt and perplexity, incertaine what to do
or determine upon, suddenly turning himself about, he observed in the snow the
print of a man's foot, which he traced from thence to Sir Williams back door,
where he perceived the entry of the same, and the exit likewise, which put him
into a greater ecstasy then before: sometimes he thought without further
question this way has my Masters Turkey been conveyed: and yet I muse who
should do it, for I may be well assured that Sir William would not so trick
me for a world of riches, neither has it been done by his consent either
knowledge: for he promised to my Master on his credit, that no other but
himself only and his boy that ever should come into that place, and then to
charge him with so foul a fact were great folly, and to my self it might
procure great displeasure. For first, if I should object this against him,
neither will my Master give any ear thereto, either believe it, so highly
stands Sir William in his favor: neither will he for any time hereafter
think well of me, for broaching such a slander. And holding this no expedient
course, before he proceeded any further in the matter, he returned into the
kitchen, where he related to the Cooks what had chanced, requesting them to
advise him what to do, who came all forth with him into the wood-yard to see
how the case stood, and could as little say to the matter as himself: diverse
were their verdicts, and they varied all in their opinions: some sti-mulated
him to charge Sir William with the stealth, others wished him to beware what he
did: some advised him to inform their Master, but the most part gave him
counsel to let it quietly pass, without making further to do about it, and
rather to give diligent attendance to the rest: alleging that if it were a
steaith, seeing no stir to be made concerning this, the thief would hazard
to have another, when he might be apprehended, and he only blamed and
punished who had committed the trespass. But while they were thus divided in
their judgments, and as it were in mutinies among themselves, Dobson as though
he had been ignorant of the whole case looking forth at his Uncles chamber
window, desired to know the cause of such their debatings, whereof they made a
brief rehearsal. Alas, God help you, are you so simple as to think your
Masters Turkey gone by any other mean, then by him the print of whose foot you
find in the snow: nay assure your selves, that whosoeuers shoe that impression
does fit, he is the person which has committed the theft. And I would
counsel you to take heed how you charge Sir William therewith: for albeit
there be probable signs that it has been conveyed through his chamber, yet
his honesty and good carriage is of such regard, both with your Master, and the
whole, as you shall incur great blame by such complaint, unless you were
able to prove it against him, and therein I do suppose you will find
difficulties, for he has never yet been convicted of any misdemeanor, and
therefore take good advise before you call him into question. And in my
opinion, to free you of your iealosie of him, it is the best course, to borrow
one of his shoes, by which you may take a sure trial whether it be he or not:
and so may you deal with more security, both in respect of him and your
selves. This counsel was contenting to them all, and according to good reason.
Knocking therefore at his chamber door, he being yet in bed, they moved his
chamberer for one of his shoes, who suspecting the cause of their request,
much against his stomach brought to them one of the same which Dobson had used
in the stelth: which agreeing equally with the print, they were al both very
sorrowful and ashamed in Sir Williams behalf: but Dobson was not a little
joyful to see his devise take such fortunate effect. The Poulterer, as he
whom it more concerned then the rest, called up Sir William, and after some
inuectiue speeches, questioned him of the Turkies stelth: but he much
meruailing why they should so strictly tax him, when they had opened unto him
the likelyhoods, inducing them to charge him, protested upon the holy Bible,
that himself was clear and innocent of such felony: and assured them
further, that neither man nor child had entrance that way by his means, or
upon his knowledge: and as for my boy (says he) I dare also give to you my
word, that he never comes in place, but when my self am present; that is,
when we go and come from service. But all this would not suffice to excuse
Sir William, Dobson so urged the Poulterer to inform Master Deane thereof:
for (says he) if you shall fail to do it, I will cause my uncle to complain
of you: for otherwise Sir William clearing himself in this manner, it may be
supposed, that my uncle or I are acknowne thereof, because our chamber window
has a prospect into the wood-yard; but by your patience sir, you shall not
block us so: and therefore as you will answer it when you shall hear
thereof, it is your fairest mean to tell first, lest you be let to understand
the same to your displeasure. And thus backed with Dobsons threatenings, he
acquainted his Master with all as you have heard. Master Deane enraged
against Sir William, sent for him, and in the presence of the Prebends examined
him of the same, who protested as before, that he did not know thereof. Well,
(said Master Deane) Sir William, we will take your word, and pardon the fault,
but yet the probability of the matter makes us to misdoubt you; and from
henceforth we will interrupt you of that walk, and entreat you to take a
little more pains and go about. At which sentence passed, Sir William inwardly
repined, that the peoples ears should be filled with these suspicions, and to
have his doors shut up. But howsoever it grieved him, he must enforce his
patience: and so with solemn protestation of his innocence, for that time he
departed home, both sorrowful and ashamed.

Dobson well pleased to have procured him this dry Bob at Master Deanes
hands, was yet notwithstanding not fully satisfied with this revenge of his
friends wrong, but determined yet further, when time served, to pay him all
that he had promised, scorning to dye in his debt: and therefore continuing
still friendly with his Chamberlain, he understood that Sir William was about a
wife, a Merchants daughter in the Town, a pretty fisgig girl, and who to
humor Sir William, would many times repair to his chamber, especially in the
winter euenings, when the neighbors could not so well observe her walks as at
other times when the days were longer, and the euenings more lightsome:
Oftentimes she would keep him company all the night, until five of the clock
in the morning, at which hour she commonly departed, that she might be at home
before her father was up and came abroad forth of his chamber, who knew nothing
of her vagaries which her mother permitted, upon the confident trust she had in
Sir William his honest usage of her, who had moved her husband and her self in
the matter, craving their favorable assents, of whom they conceived a singular
good liking, and desired to accomplish the match with him, conditionally that
Master Deane would assure him his place by pattent during his life, but
thereof he was quite hopeless in respect of his late accident, and dared not
to make suit for it; and thereuppon they deferred to give their consents,
especially the merchant himself, but the maid being much affected toward him,
and longing to be a mistress in the Abbey, frequented his company as before is
said: whereof Dobson being perfitely instructed by the chamberer, labored his
wits, without intermission, how to gall sir Williams delicates with some
bitter sirrope of disgrace: and having a nimble head and working brain, he
thus effected his drift, he learned of the boy what night they had appointed
for their next meeting at his masters chamber, which the boy discovered unto
him: but why desire thou to know, said he, fearing some such pretense as
before he had drawn him unto? O nothing said Dobson, but if then thou could
be absent, I should be glad to have thy company at the sign of the Foare,
where I have set down that night to meet certain Gentlemen of the country,
to whom I have promised a song, and a set of music, and I shall think my
self much in thy debt if thou will be there to sing the Mean amongst us,
which if thou shall do, the least part of their liberality shall not be
thine.

Say no more (said the boy) for if mistress Jane hold her appointment, and lodge
with my master all the night, so soon as they are gone to bed, I will not
fail to be one among you, but if they sit up all night, then I cannot be away,
for that I must be sent into the town for wine, or some other conceit, as they
shall think good. Why then said Dobson, this is all that we may resolve, that
if she come according to promise, and occasion serve that thou may present
thy self with us, then we shall have thy company; and if otherwise, thou shall
certify me, to the end that we may provide another to supply thy want: Thereof
be you assured said the boy, and make no doubt: that suffices, quoth Dobson,
and so farewell. The boy took his direct course to his mistress chamber, and
Dobson his to certain of his dearest friends, whom he desired to afford him
their assistance in the stealing of a Diere the next tuesday ensuing, for says
he, a kinswoman of mine in the country who longs for venison, has sent to
me to provide her. I have both entreated for her, and offered money, but
cannot procure her a simple fee, and rather than she shall receive harm for
the want thereof, I will hazard to fetch one forth of Bears park, so I may
entreat your good helps. And if Fortune favor our attempts, look what shall
be more than to stay her longing, shall be at your own disposing, neither
shall you fear any inconvenience to come thereof: for if that our chance
should be so evil as to be taken, I trust well that my uncle will work our
atonement with Master Deane, and set us free from punishment, and in respect
of that favor I shall rest wholly yours at all times to pleasure you. Dobsons
reputation was such amongst the caualieroes in the city, that he could not so
easily request, as they assent to effect his desires, assuring that to do him
any pleasure, they were all at all times ready to abide any penalty of the
law, without exspectation of favor, or forbearaunce: for he said, he who will
stand forth to help his friends necessity for any fear, is not worthy the
name of a good fellow, and therefore make choice of your time, and we will not
be wanting to go with you, which they performed according to his assignement.
And by the help of their greyhounds, they quickly had killed their game, and
trussing her upon a horse, they brought her safely away, the Keepers that night
neglecting their watch. Dobson directed them to an Inn in the town, where he
desired them to attend his coming, which should be within an hour after. And
when he once supposed them to be safe in the house, he went to the Keepers
Lodge in the Park, willing them to rise, for this night, says he, one of
your diere is slain and carried hence, as I conjecture, for coming this
eeuening to my uncle Pharaoes, I met her upon the shoulders of four good
fellows, and (to my judgment) she is carried to sir Williams chamber, the
usher of the singing school, so that if your self did not bestow her upon
him, I believe that there you shall find both her and the parties that have
committed the slaughter; for among them I could perfitly discern sir William,
and his brother Robert: what the other were I could not so well observe, for
they shunned my way a little, and my self was loath to be espied of them: and
therefore now that I have discharged my love and duty to master Deane, and my
good will to you: deal you herein as reason and the cause requires, and
herewith he departed posting after his companions as he could, until he came
to the Inn, where he had appointed them to stay, and sir Williams boy to
meet him, who had continued there the most part of the night to attend his
coming. Dobson commanding the cooks to make ready the venison, taking his
companion aside, asked him if mistress Jane were with sir William or not: yea
and by this asleep betwixt his arms: and so let her be, quoth Dobson, we
shall fare the better for their sakes, God send them joy at their arising, and
so going into the company again, they fell to sporting until the venison was
made ready.

The keeper of Bearesparke much moved at Dobsons relation, without further
delays leapt from his bed, and having put upon him his apparel, away he
pased to Dunholme in haste, never so much as breathing till he came to the
Deanes lodging, where knocking at the gates, he commanded the Porter to let
him in, for he had serious matters to deliver to his master, and that
presently, being brought to his bed chamber, and admitted to speak, he made
rehearsal of Dobsons report, further annexing, that if it would please his
worship to arise, and to make search in sir Williams chamber, at this instant
we shall take all them who have done injury to your worship, and murdered the
game. The Deane believing that every thing was even so as he had said, having
him in suspicion for his Turkey, arose in a great chafe against sir William,
and caused his men to call up so many of the prebends as were then in the
town, to assist him. They much maruelling what occasions he had to employ them
at that time of the night: they made great haste to come to his lodging,
whither when they were all arrived, he declared the cause of his disturbing of
them so extraordinarily, craving their pardon, because (says he) if I should
tolerate him to proceed in these courses, he will do shame to us all, in the
face of the world; and for that you shall not suppose that I run against him
upon mere suggestions, or splenatiue informations, I have therefore requested
your presences, that you might be eyewitnesses of his abuses done against me:
for notwithstanding that by my means he was not only placed in the School,
as you all know, but also was allowed the pleasures of my gardens, and
orchards, until such time as my Turkey was (through his default) taken away
and stolen, which I pardond him with the only abridgement of my garden
contents, and the pleasures he thereby received: but in requital of my
benignities he has this night with other his confederates and loose fellows
gone into my Park and stolen away one of my diere, and at this instant, in his
chamber, is feasting there with the associates of his knaueries, whither I
request you all to accompany me, that they may be all arrested, and undergo
such penalty as the law to such offenders has limited, for I perceive, that
further to forbear him, is but to stimulate and egg him forwards to all other
fortes of disorder. Unto which his speech, they giving a general applause,
set forward with him to search sir Williams chamber, who (poor man) fearing
no such matter, was laid arm in arm with his sweet mistress Jane: and as he
supposed, secure enough. But we see no man so much in danger as he who
dreadeth none. Sir William unbracing his sweet mistress is awaked forth of his
dreams, and commanded to s^t open his doors that master Dean may come in: O
good Lord, who can explane the perplexities he conceived at the name of Master
Deane? Alas said he to mistress Jane, what shall we now do? or course shall we
take to keep you from his sight? sor at the back door I can not dismiss
you, for he has caused that passage to be barred up so strongly, as that it
can not be broken: nay, and perhaps his business is into the wooddeyeard, and
then that were the worst of all other courses, conueiaunce I have none to hide
you in, and if I should thrust you into my study, it is to be doubted that
there he will find you: and I had rather go bare foot to Rome, than that he
should so overtake us, for we were not only undone, but shamed for ever. It is
wonder to me what he has to do with me thus late in the night, or what
should move him to come hither in th^s manner, unless some of purpose have
given him intelligence of your being here.

The young girl not able to advise him, qu^king for fear, and ready to sincke
with shame, prayed him to thrust her under the bed, for sure says she, he will
have no occasion to see^e there for any thing, and casting her clothes about
her as it would be, she crept under the bed her self, and sir William
covered her with an old carpet: but the Deane offended that he made no more
speed to let him into the house, persuading himself, that he of purpose kept
him there, till he had conueighed his associates and the venison out of sight,
commanded his men violently, to break open the doors, and enter the house:
all which they did, and lighting up torches, gave way for M. Deane and the
Prebends to come in; who strictly examined sir William of his companions and
the veneson, charging him to tell them where he had bestowed them, and it.
(But sir William Godwot) though his conscience testified unto him that he was
accessarie to no such action, yet upon this heavy tax of M. Deane, he was
ready to fall dead before them, swearing and protesting that he never came into
that park, day nor night about any such purpose, humbly praying M. Deane to
pardon him, and to alter such his conceits, for (says he) I am a true and just
man. But at this reply, the Keeper assured M. Deane that the very same night
one Dear was killed, and that he who told him thereof, could not be mistaken
of sir William. M. Deane there upon, notwithstanding all his solemn
protestations, commanded to search every corner of the chamber, and under the
bed, where they found the poor Do in a cold palsy, who for shame to be so
taken, sownded in the presence of them all, and was ready to give up the ghost:
sir William became mute, and fared like a man destraughted. The Deane and
Prebends blamed him very much, and threatened to punish these disorders, yet all
did their endeavors to bring Mistress Jane to her perfect senses again. And
when she was recovered they sent her home to her mothers house, willing her
mother to respect more her daughters honesty and good name. Dobson and his
associats were thrust in among the searchers, and laughed their parts at sir
William his interprize. The Deane and Prebends returned home to their beds, so
blanked with this bob, that they could not tell what to conceit other, then
that some mad brain fellow, either spiting at, or meaning to make a scorn of
sir William, had of purpose plotted it: but before the morning was blased
through the city the whole accedents, at which a number made good pastime.
Poor Mistress Jane kept her closet, ashamed to peep out of doors, until
her father taking the matter in snuff, went to M. Deane and the Prebends,
desiring them to constrain sir William to make amends to his daughter, and in
the sight of the people to marry her: whith they compelled him to do, and to
gratify the Merchant, they confirmed him a pattent of the Vshership as largely
as he desired and contrary to his expectation. After this the truth of the
matter was published, neither did any man disallowe of Dobsons bob, and sir
William ever after was careful not to offend him, or any of his friends.

How Dobson deceived his friend Raikebaines of a Pudding, and how he shut him
up in the Candle cupbord. The fifth Chapter.
DObson seeing his matches to make so well and his contrinings to come to so
good a pass, broke his Bobbes on each man's nose, without respect, he spared no
persons but as occasion was offered, he played the wagge, sometime in the city,
other while in the country, by means whereof his fame spread it self all
over: and all pleasantly disposed humourists, sought to be acquainted with him,
although he were but yet a scholar: neither did at chiue any small
commendations for his practice against Sir William. But before this he had
plotted diverse others in the schools amongst his fellows, whereof one was
this: Rakebaines (of whom before we have spoken) was borne in the country six
miles distant from Dunhoime, whither he was sent to the school, to be
instructed in good letters, and sundry good manners sitting his estate and
parentage. He was tabled with a sister of his mothers married to a Lawyer in
the City, who had also a son which daily did accompany him to the school,
as very a wagge as the best, yet he always more smoothly carried his knaueries
then Rakebaines did; never putting his hand to any action, but when he was
assured of another betwixt him and the halter. This Raikebains father being a
gentleman of good port and great hospitality, kept continually a liberal and
bountiful house; and toward Christmas time he killed every year great store
of beasts. His mother to applaud her sons content, at such times always sent
to him and her nephew some store of puddings: which he, to thend he might brave
of his mothers respect toward him amongst his fellow scholars, would many times
carry with him to the school, therewith to break his fast, when the rest were
licensed to go home, or to their Innes, which ordinarily they were wont to do
at eight a clock in the morning. So it happened his cousin to be sick,
Raikebaines was to go to school alone; he thought it better to carry his
breakefast with him, then to trouble himself to come so far for it. And
because he thought there was nothing so fit for his carriage as a pudding* he
desired the maid to bestow one upon him, which his request she assented unto.
But when it approached near breakefast time, he took great care how to have
it safely warmed, and that it might not be snatched from him: and therefore
fearing the disorders of his fellows, he entreated Dobson to afford his
assistance, and to stand his friend: which if he should do, he promised to
share it equally betwixt them. Dobson purposing in steed of an inch to take an
ell, and for the whole scarcely to return the skin, prepared a place for it
before the fire, and would not permit any man to come during the time it was in
making hot. And before that it was thoroughly warmed, the clock stroke eight,
and every man departed except Dobson and Raikebaines, who staid expecting til
the pudding should be warm enough. Dobson having the promise of the half,
sat devising how he might possess him of the whole: and so when he perceived
it to be hot enough: James (says he) look out at the window, and see whether
any of them be returning to the school or not: for if they shall come before
we have made an end, they will so molest us, that we shall not eat it in
quiet: so that if thou do espy any of them to be near hand, we will convey
our selves into some corner, until we have made dispatch thereof. But whilst
James Rakebaines was ascending into the window, to do as he was advised, away
goes Dobson with the pudding through the Church and Cloister, into the Cannons
hall, wherein shutting himself, and fast bolting the doors, he feasted
himself with the whole pudding: but Raikebanes in hope to recover some part at
the least, pursued him with huy and cry through Church and Cloister, until he
came to the Common hall, where finding the doors bolted, he stayed knocking
and exclaiming the space of an hour* but could have no entrance, neither any
answer. In the mean time while he there continued rapping and calling to
his friend, sometimes imperiously commanding Dobson to part stake, and to make
equal diuidence with him: otherwhile entreating him to reward him with some
small portion, who once was owner of the whole. Sir Thomas passing that way
from his chamber to the Chancel, hearing him many times to nominate Dobson,
came to know the cause of his disturbance. Rakebaines fully confiding by his
help to have either his pudding, (...) some part thereof restored, diselesed
to him all the circumstances aforesaid: who much offended for his wrongs
received, commanded Dobson to appear in his likeness, and to come to his
answer: he hearing the voice of his uncle, came straight to the doors, and
vnboulting the same, patiently heard all that ever could be objected against
him, unto the which he made this reply. Uncle (says he) you may do as you see
cause, in believing him or me, but surely he has foreskipped and told to you
my tale, for my Aunt Pharoe sent me this pudding upon Saturday last, which I
reserved until now. And in very deed, because I feared that whilst I were
called by my Master to sing, or other exercise, happily it might have been
stolen from me, I entreated him to give respect thereto till it were warmed,
and to recompense his pains I promised to bestow upon him some part thereof:
but he would needs be his own caruer, and either have the greater half, or
none: which because he refused to stand to my benevolence, and the pact made
betwixt us, I have wholly dispatched, and have left him none thereof: and for
this cause he cries and exclaimeth against me, as you hear. Raikebaines
perceiving by Dobsons countenance, that if he should reply against him, or deny
any thing which Dobson had said to be true, that he should then for ever loose
his friendship, seemed to yield to his affection, and to grant his defensorie
speech for truth, contenting himself both to brook the injury, and eke to
bear the blame.

Sir Thomas seeing no great cause upon the rehearsal made by both the parties
why to chide his nephew, requested Raikebaines to acquiet himself for that
time, and charged the other no more so to dis-taste his familiar frind: But it
was not long before Dobson had forgot his uncles strict iniunction, and his
promise of better using his friends: for it was his humor, never to play one
shrewd turn alone, but being of a scrupulous conscience, he paid ever his
debts double over, and scorned to restore the capital sum without the
interest, and therefore once more he made bold with his fellow, curbing his
exspectations: and because Lent was at hand, he prepared him to observe the
fast. This same year his uncle sir Thomas was chosen Choraster of the
Cathedral, and to set up the tapers at the times of service, both morning and
evening, from the feast of Saint Martine, until the feast of March. Sir
Thomas, whether it were that leuing his bed well in a morning, he was loath to
rise so early in that cold season, or otherwise, for that he would have his
nephew to have experience in these offices, whereunto in future times he might
be elected and promoted, and not to be to learn when he should be placed
therein. He made him his substitute, and appointed him to lighten and
extinguish the tapers and candles, specially in the mornings: which Dobson
diligently performed with the assistance of his fellows, who in hope to have
some of the short ends which could no more be set up for the Church service
did daily both before and after prayers, which were to be done at six of the
clock in the morning, help him in the said office. And principally this
Rakebains attended him more then any of the rest, to whom in respect of his
diligence he had promised the square end of a great taper, at the laying up of
the lights: which when Dobson was shutting of the cubboord, as seeming to have
forgot his promise Raikebaines demanded. Dobson intending to intrappe him,
threw it to the further end of the cupboord, so far, that it was not possible
to reach to it, unless that one of them should creep in, which Raikebaines
offered to do, rather than that he would want the commodity of the candle,
and so presently skipped into the candle cupboord, to fetch away the Taper: but
Dobson locked fast the doors and departed thense to the schools, leaving
Raikebaines to play the Cat, and warrant his tapers from the tyranny of the
Rattes, where he sat shut up howling and crying, from half hour past six,
until almost ten in the sorenoone, at which time sir Thomas and other the
Canons came to put upon them their Surplises, in which ordinarily they soong
their Service, and which, for readiness sake, they kept continually lying in
presses there.

Raikebaines hearing the sound of voices, and the noise of men's feet, cried
forth so loud as he could, to the great admiration of sir Thomas, and the
residue of the Cannonists, who speaking in at the key hole, asked who it should
be that was in his candle-cupboord, It is I, quoth Raikebaines. And who are you
said sir Thomas? James Raikebains replied he. Alas quoth sir Thomas, how came
thou into that place? and how long have thou sit there? Ever since half an
hour after six this morning answered Raikebaines, and your nephew Dobson
shut me here, because I went into the cupboord to fetch forth the end of a
taper which himself had promised to bestow upon me, for helping him to gather
and extinguish the lights after prayer. Sir Thomas pitying the poor boy,
almost starued with cold and hunger, went to seek for his nephew Dobson in the
Schools to set Raikebaines at liberty, threatening to punish him for his
mis-vsage. But Dobson excused himself, and said that Raikebains icapt into the
cupboord contrary to his will, and swore that he would not come from thence,
unless that he had a whole candle which he had espied in the furthest corner,
which I neither would, neither durst do without your consent, and therefore
did I think it very fit that he should abide your coming, and now it is in
your choice to bestow upon him, or not, and therewith vnlocking the doors,
seely Raikebaines was scarcely able to crawle forth, his joints were so
stiffened and benumbed with cold. Sir Thomas somewhat to ease his extreamities
bestowed upon him a couple of candles, and liberally rewarded Dobson with a
bobbe upon the mouth, insomuch as the blood followed his fist, and that done,
attiring himself in his roabes, he went forward to do his service in the
Chauncell, leaving Dobson and Raikebaines further to decide the case betwixt
themselves at the candle cupboord.

How Dobson revenged himself upon his uncle. Chap. 6.
DObson was much disco^tented for the blow given unto him by his uncle, yet
considering how well he had deserved the same, in regard of the injury done
to his friend, he reconciled himself again to Raikebans, with promise, that if
he would forgette that discurtesie, he never more would wrong, injury, or
disgrace him, but patronize his cause against all opponants of what sort
soever, in which he kept touch with him as by the usage of sir William the
Usher appeared. Raikebanes being of a gentle and good nature easily pardoned
the offense, and joining hands, they protested to continue perfect Friends each
to other during their lives, and so returned to the School well satisfied,
where Dobson sat all the day oppressd with melancholy, casting his thoghts up
and down, how to come clear with his Uncle, but he could not apprehend any
occasion in the world as then: yet gave he not over to exspect, or urge some
fit opportunity of revenge, and after diverse purposes which missed him, in
the end he thus resolved. At the Uncle of S. Giles, his Uncle had a very fair
Orchard, in which every year he had growing great abundance of goodly and
pleasant fruits, for which he was so careful, that always nigh unto the time
of their ripening, he hired sometimes one, sometimes two fellows to watch his
Orchards in the night season, and to defend his fruits from stealing. Dobson
having a goodwill to ease his stomach upon his Uncle, agreed with certain of
his merry acquaintances, one night in Apple-time to enter the Orchard, and from
thence to conueigh such fruit as possibly they were able to bear, promising
to assist them himself, entreating them if they were molested, to beat well
and soundly the Keepers thereof, and to use his Uncle as he would devise, if he
came to their succors: him (says he) when you have gagged, and bound the two
Keepers so surely that they cannot move, or do you any incombrance, I would
have you to put into a sack, binding first his hands and feet, and
permitting only his head to appear lest he should be smootherd, gagging him
likewise lest he cry, and be redeemed of his neighbors, then in some place of
the orchard where the trees be thickest, I wish to have him trussed up by the
heels, where let him hang till he wax more tender, for he is old and too
tough for the spit: And for my self, I purpose that time to be absent from the
house, because you shall not be hindered by me, nor interrapted: but be sure
that you bind not my Uncle too hard, neither yet give any great blows, but
with as much facility as you can, bind as I have instrncted you, wherein, if
you shall accomplish my desire, I shall think my self both bounden unto you
for helping me so be revenged, and also I shall be willing to repay your kindness,
when any occasion thereof is ministered.

They willed him to take no further thought, than only to devise a mean for
his own absenting, and they would perform all the rest as he had directed,
the next Wednesday night ensuing. Dobson thanked them, and upon Wednesday he
entreated his Uncle to license him to go see his father and other friends in
the country: For Uncle (says he) I have not been there now the space of
these ten years, and I am very desirous to visit them, and for two days to
be merry amongst them, unto which his desire, his uncle condescended: and
Dobson (seeming to him to go to his father) passed no further then into the
Town, to forward these fellows in the execution of their intended stratageme,
he went therefore first unto a Carpenters shop, and caused a horse of wood to
be made, with a sword, dagger, and distaffe of the same, all the which he got
planted in a gorgeous manner, and bringing them to his companions upon
wednesday at night; he goes with them to the utter side of the Orchyard,
where taking down two pale boordes, which he before had loosened, they made
themselves a way to enter. They, so soon as they were within, begaune to lay
agood amongst the Apple trees, making a great rushing and noise, of purpose:
the keepers came to know their intents, and to bring them before sir Thomas,
but the conflict was unequal, for they were fire against two: yet being
sturdy fellows, of a good stomach, and standing upon the justness of their
quarrel, encountered them all very lustily, until the one of them was beaten
down to the ground, and the other being ouermatched, fled into the Vicarage,
and told sir Thomas how the case did stand. At the hearing whereof, he arose
in great haste, calling up also his housekeeper, willing her to follow after
him with the broach, and to kill the first with whom she incountred: for,
says he, this nights work shall be memorable in Dunholme, while there is one
stone thereof standing. And fearing lest he should not be well happed with
blows, casting his gown loosely about his shoulders, forth he marched, and
the old beldame his sister with a broach, and the keeper of the Orchard with a
portigan. But while sir Thomas was making himself ready for the fight within,
the thieves had chained the other fellow whom before they had beaten down,
and also had gagged him so well, that he could not cry, and were exspecting
close by the doors, when sir Thomas would sally forth, they tripped his heels
at unawares, being nearer at hand than he looked for, and muffled him in his
gown, until they had made him ready for the sack: Then taking his gown they
put it upon his sister, and tying her hands behind her, they set her upon
the wooden horse, as Dobson had prescribed, and bound her teete under his
belly, which done, they girde her about with the painted sword and dagger,
setting upon her head a paper hatte with a bush of peacocke feathers eaualiere
like, ready to challenge every man to the combat, and in this gnise they placed
her under a pear sree. Sir Thomas did they thrust into a sack, and by his
nephews advise, who fearing that so long hanging by the heetes, as til the next
morrow, might procure him some infirmity, they reared him into the same pear
tree above his sister, and making for him a chair of estate of the boughs,
they bound in the one haud the distaffe, and in his other, a skimmerand
spreading his arms, they fastened him by the wrests unto the branches that
were next him. While some of them were thus in hand with sir Thomas, and his
housekeeper, the other took the twowarders, and bound and gagged them as is
aforesaid: they fastened their hands about a appletree, turning their hose
down beneath their knees, so as their buttocks were set naked to the tree,
fastening them to the truncke below. Besides the gagges, they put into either
of their mouths, a bunch of May, and a pricking Thorn: and before them they
heaped a bundle of bauine, and other dry wood in form of a fire, and the
broach hung full of apples as it were to be roasted. Then taking so much fruit
as them liked, they departed home, leaving sir Thomas and his seruitours to
keep the watch.

Dobson very timely in the morning repaired to the vicarage, and knowing his
uncles necessity, he passed through the house into the orchard, to take a view
of his devises: and when he came unto the pear tree wherein his uncle was
inthronized, he called up to him, in sorrowful manner wringing his hands,
and as it would be, wrested forth some small number of tears. But his uncle
sat as a man who had perished the use of his tongue, for speak he could not, in
regard of his gagge, neither could he move, or make any sign, they had so
straightened all his joints. His Aunt also buckled upon her prancing courser in
martial manner, like Bellona goddess of battle, sat dareing Mars and all
his chivalry: and the two keepers in their disguises, like Tantalus, stood
gaping, as though they would have caught the apples off from the broach, but
could not reach them. Dobson to persuade his uncle that he was ignorant of this
practice, ran howling up and down the orchard, as it were, affrighted with
this lamentable sight, and from thence into the streets, calling the
neighbors all about to come to his assistance. The people upon his outery
flocked in heaps into the orchard, to see what the matter was, much lamenting
sir Thomas his evil chance, the rather, for that it was done so privately, as
that they had no intelligence, either to have prevented, or to have redressed
his wrongs. But it was no time then to debate the matter, his present case
required more their helping hands, to unbind him, than their advise how an
other time to prevent the like misfortune: So some bringing a ladder, scaled up
the tree where he sa^e, and unbinding his arms, they brought him down so
tenderly as they could in blankets, fearing, because he could not speak, that
with extremity of cold, he was fallen into some sowning palsy: and being in
some hope, that by warmness he might be brought to his senses again, they
carried him into the house, and placed him in his bed, forth of the which he
stirred not for the space of three days, neither all that time could he speak
one word, either receive any meat, but only such liquide sirropes as his
keeper powered into him with spoones: The Physicians were in some doubt of his
recovery of health, for which Dobson was unfeignedly sorrowful, and repented
that ever he devised such a stratageme. His Awnt was sick for a tweluemoneth
after: But the two young fellows whose spirits were more quick and lively,
after they had bin set before the fire, and lapped well in warm clothes,
began to recover themselves. And as they perceived their tongues able to
move, they unfolded all the case as if came to pass. The neighbors very
pensive for their Curates mischaunce, diligently attended about him, till he
was able to do for himself. And Dobson sent for his mother, to take charge of
the house, during the time of his infirmity. But sir Thomas, whether that he
merrily conceived, or otherwise was certainly informed, that Dobson was the
plotter of this devise in all after times, took such exceptions against him,
as that no action of his was grateful or acceptable in his sight, where at
Dobson more storming than before, as opportunity sorted to his designements,
he repayed all his uncles discountenances with measurable disgraces; yet
keeping a more moderate course, and giving respect that he did no more hazard
his uncles life and welfare.

How Dobson caused his uncles horse to be impownded, because he denied to let
him go with him into the Country. Chap. 7.
WHen sir Thomas was perfitly recouerd of his agew, he was invited by diverse
of his friends into the country, to pass away some part of the summer,
persuading him that the fresh air was both comfortable and wholesome after his
so long sickness: and it was about the Whitsontide, when the country people
having affections to be merry, Dobson requested his uncle to grant him leave
to accompany him, and to steed him in place of a seruingman: but sir Thomas
thinking it a thing inconvenient, to commit the whole care of his house to
his sister alone, who was an old decrepite creature, not able to move
herself without a staff, much less unfit to make resistance, if any
knowing their absence should break into the house, and offer to spoil him of
his stuff and treasure. Again, he supposed Dobson made such request, only to
neglect and commit some knavery there, whereby to make himself as famous in
the country, as he was memorable in the city. And therefore these particulars
considered, he denied to let him have his desire. Dobson said nothing, but
showed himself well appeased, yet he intended to abridge his uncle as much of
his pleasure as he had done him of his. And at the very time his uncle was to
set forward with his progress, one of those good fellows, who had favored
him in the breaking of the Orchard, was sent for into Northumberland to his
mother, who lay at the point of death, and desired to speak with him before
she passed this life. And he both loath to take so great a journey on foot,
and not having a horse of his own, could not tell how (so presently) to speed
himself of one, as these his importunities and haste required; he acquainted
Dobson with his want, and entreated him amongst his friends, for that time, to
further him, and he would pleasure him as much, if so his arrand came in his
way. Dobson told him, that in the town (upon so short warning) he could not
procure him any, unless, quoth he, I might make bold with my uncles gelding,
which if thou could return before to morrow morning, I could then supply thy
necessity, and otherwise I should disappoint himself, for he is to ride into
the country, to take the air after his long sickness, and to feast it amongst
his friends. O good Dobson, said his acquaintance, hazard alittle to pleasure
me, and in any thing thou shall command me, though the execution thereof should
stand with the expense of my blood and life, yet will I not refuse to adventure
for thy life, fame, and reputation: for if my mother should be departed before
my coming, I shall be utterly undone, and great is the loss that may redound
to me thereby. To morrow at night, at the utmost, I will send him back, and if
so long he will not defer his journey: He is not of such slender
acquaintance, neither so ill be^oued, but that he may have choice amongst his
parishioners and neighbors.

Dobson of all other things detesting ingratitude, and not to seem unmindful
of pleasures received, or careless in requital of good offices, willd him to
provide him self of furniture requisite, and he promised to affoorde him a
horse forthwith, conditionally that whenever thou bring him back, thou
shall leave him somwhere in the pownd within three miles of the City, charging
the Pinder to proclaim the next market day, that so my uncle may come to
hear of him again: and will him also to take, not only an ordinary fee, but
also for his pasture for so many days as thou have him in travel, and so if
thou will stay a week* I shall license thee. His friend much, and heartily
thanked him, protesting never to fail in whatsoever he could, by any of his
endeauours to do him benefit, and receiving the gelding at the place appointed
betwixt them, held on his journey with a gladsome cheer for this favor of his
friend, and left sir Thomas, either to borrow upon his neighbors, or to stay
at home, or like a stowt fellow to step upon his stumpes. The same night
after supper was ended, sir Thomas willed Dobson to warn his tenant that
looked to his said gelding, and such other beasts as he had grazing a mile
distant from the town, to take him into the stables that night, to the end he
might have him in readiness to be gone betimes the next morning, for he
purposed to dine ten miles from the City. Dobson went presently and
delivered his message, and sent the fellow to the fields, who sought him all
that night, and the next day, in every pasture, field, and town within five
miles circuit, but could hear nothing of the horse. Sir Thomas weening him as
ready now as at other times, got him to bed that night somewhat soon, to the
end he might be stirring more early the next morrow: in which so soon as the
day appeered, he arose and made himself fit for his journey, he put on his
holiday apparel, his boots and spurs, called for his breakefast, and never
asked for his horse, until he had ordered all things in the house, desiring
his sister friendly to entertain all such his neighbors and acquaintaunces as
should come to visit her during his tarriance in the Country: charging Dobson
to be dilligent in the accomplishment of all her commandments, and to
abstain from all kind of disorders till his return, to give good respect to
all things about the house, and at his chamber in the Fratery: and so kissing
his sister for a farewell (after the manner of the Country) he willed Dobson to
bring him his horse to the doors. Dobson returning from the stables, came and
told his uncle, that his man had not brought him as yet from the fields, as
he supposed, for upon hooks were hanging his bridle and saddle, but he could
see no horse. Sir Thomas chafed at the fellow his tenant, and sent Dobson to
his house to know the cause why he was not yet come. The wife told him that
she had not seen him since his being there, when he without further delay
went to fetch him: and because he came not home to his bed, I judged my
Master had sent him abroad for the dispatch of some other of his businesses,
so that if he be not with you, for my life I cannot certify what is become of
him. Dobson carried back her answer; which answer sir Thomas hearing, he knew
not what to imagine, but strait he imagined his horse to be stolen, and so
affirmd. O God forbid, said Dobson, my hope is, that he is only strayed forth
into some of our neighbors grounds, or else is some where in the pownd. If so,
said his uncle, then the fellow would have got some notice of him before this
time: and so perhaps, good uncle, he will be here with him shortly. In which
hope sir Thomas kept on his boots all that day till night, when home came the
fellow without the horse, neither could tell any news of him. ^ir Thomas
feared he had been stolen, and for the very sorrow thereof, he stayed his
iourny for that time, and sent his man to every coast of the Country, to
inquire after him: but all his labor was in vain, until the return of the
party, to whom Dobson had lent him, who observing Dobsons prescript, left him
in the pownd, at Chester in the street, charging the Pindar to take his
accustomed fees, and for a weeks pasture more, when he should be sent for by
the owner. The Pindar very glad of so good a pledge, caused proclamation to be
made in Dunholme the next morrow after that he was left with him. Some one of
his neighbors that was present thereat, gave sir Thomas to understand thereof,
who by the description knew him to be his. He sent for him immediately, and
gave the Pindar his whole demand with all his heart, rejoicing to have got his
gelding again; which he verily supposed had bin stolen.

How Dobson brewed Ale for his uncle. Chap. 8.
DObson yet hardly brooking his uncles discurtesie, and perceiving him to be
daily, estraunged, having got the reins into his hands, did grow carelesie
more liberally run at large, and never took up with himself, until he
had thrust his neck into the halter, when if his uncle had not stood his very
good friend, he had bid his kinsefolkes al adieu with his heels, and had
daunced his last measures upon the gallows: but fearing no such matter as
then, neither imagining to be so much needful of his kindness, he spared not
to play the fool with him, who afterward proved his best friend: neither did
he think himself sufficiently satisfied with the abuse he had already
offered, but ever as he could catch an accurrence to do him further grief, he
put to execution the same forthwith. His uncle to recompense his neighbors
careful respect of him in his sickness, invited them to a Friday nights
drinking, letting them to understand, that whereas they were sorry for his late
misfortune, as well appeared by their care and pains taken about him during the
time of his infirmity, which their gratitude and kindness commixt with
compassion, though he were not of power in equal measure able to satisfy, and
according to their well deseruings, yet his willingness should never be
wanting, to afford so much as his estate and ability permitted: and therefore
praying them to pardon his insufficiency, and to accept of his good will, he
wished he might be so bold as to entreat them to take a cup of Ale with him,
and an apple, the Friday at night following, which he promised should be of the
best to be had in Dunholme. They excusing their negligence, told him they were
ashamed that they did no better steed him, when his necessity so required, but
they could do no more but sorrow for their defect: and for such troublesome
guests as they should be, they told him that he needed not to fear to want* He
greatly contented with the grateful acceptance of his simple offer, bespoke
his Hostess to send to his chamber half a dozen gallons of her best Ale,
which she did according to his appointment. He further commanded his
housekeeper to bestow it in some safe place, where none might have access to
trouble it, until it were clear and fined: which she did (as she imagined)
yet Dobson had a shift to deceive her, as well as to set his uncles geldings in
the fold. So, upon the Thursday at afternoon before his uncles guests were to
come, he and his fellow scholars having liberty to dispend the day at their
choice, and were dismissed of al school exercises, he willing to make them a
banquet, carried such as he specially favored with him to the Vicarage, where
preventing his uncles guests, he made the most part of them drunk as Rats.
When he had placed them all so near to the house as he thought convenient, he
came to his Aunt, and told her that Sir Thomas was come to the Church, to see
if the Organs were in tune, for the next Sunday they were to be used: and
because he would not altogether rely on his own judgment therein, he had
brought with him half a dozen of his familiars, to help to reform them, if
need so required, to whom, in regard of their pains, he had promised a cup of
his Ale; and therefore willed her to tappe it, and to send him a Jacke thereof
to the Church. She believing this his tale to be true, gave to him the key of
the house where it was kept, desiring him to broach it, in respect her sight
was so imperfect, that she could not well discern what she did. Dobson glad of
his commission, extended this authority, played the bountiful Butler, and did
draw forth into tankards (which he of purpose had provided) more then half his
uncles Ale: yet because he was loath that his uncle should want of his measure,
he filled up the barrel with water which he found there standing in pailes:
and surrendering again the key to the custody of his Aunt, away he went (as she
weened) to the Church to his Uncle, but in very deed he returned to his
companions, where he had left them shooting in the meadows, who laughing at
Dobsons deceiving of his Aunt, drunk healthes soliberally one to another, as
not one of them was able to go home, but as Dobson conducted them. The next
night ensuing the guests came according to their promise, whom Sir Thomas
welcomed with many fair and courteous speeches, much thanking them, that they
would vouchsafe to assemble to his poor lodging, and accept of such a poor
pittance as he had provided, which he said was a roasted apple and a cup of
Ale, which I dare pawn you my word is the best in Dunholme: and while the
apples were at the fire, he willed his housekeeper to fill a glass thereof,
that they might taste it, and suspend their verdicts how they liked it: his
very conceit served to make it good enough in his judgment, so that when he
tasted, he could not perceive the commixture: but commending it for singular
good, gave it to him who sat next, willing him to drink well thereof, for he
was very welcome to it: but he espying it pale in the glass, feared that it
was not such as Sir Thomas commended it to be, yet notwithstanding he kiked the
cup, and reached to another, and so it went through them all, and yet the
better half remained vndrunke.

Sir. Thomas maruelling to see them leave so little in the glass, asked them
how they liked the same, for it seems by your drinking that it is not such as
you looked for: indeed (said they) it might be made good again, with brewing
over again, but we have drunk much better in our lives than it is now, and
seldom worse. Whereupon sir Thomas half ashamed so rashly to have praised it,
and in great chaife against his Hostess, took the glass and tasted it
again, an^ drinking the remainder he swore, that it was more than half
water, and asked his housekeeper how it came to pass* what (says she) do
you mislike it now, and could find no sault with it yesterday? was it good
then, and naughty to night? Yesterday (said he) I never tasted it before this
present, and how could I then give judgment of the good or bad quality
thereof? No, (said his sister) did not you send our nephew to me yesterday,
with commandment to broach it, and to send you a tankard of the same to the
Church? never I (quoth sir Thomas) in all my life: why then (said she) he has
deceived me, for such message he brought, and I trusted him and let him to
take what he would; for he assured me, that it was for your self, and your
friends with you. Dobson hearing this sedule of his Aunt, stole forth into a
place where the Hens sit upon a fleake, whither he ascended, pulling up the
ladder after him, that no man could come to him but by his permission: his
Uncle upon this relation of his sister, called and sought for Dobson in every
corner of the house, but he would make no answer; until at the last sir
Thomas hearing a rushing upon the fleake, espied his cock sitting amongst his
hens: and after he had thundered forth some threatening speeches, he commanded
him to descend, not so (good Uncle, says he) unless you will first swear
that you will pardon me, I telling you the truth of the matter, and otherwise,
rather than I will sustain your rigorous punishment, I will throw my self
headlong from hence, and will take it upon my death, that the very fear of
your severity has urged me so to do, answer you the law as you can. The
neighbors entreated sir Thomas to remit to him that fault, and to be pacified,
offering all to pass their words, that he should never more in such sort
offend him: he afraid that the violent fellow would do himself some injury,
at their important suites pardoned him, upon condition that he would bewray the
truth, which he did, and came down from the fleake, and to make his Uncle,
some kind of satisfaction, he went into the town and fetched some better Ale,
wherewithal he intended to entertain his honest friends, and loving
neighbors all.

How Dobson furnished himself of a suit of apparel: and how he used his
Schoole-fellow. Chap. 9.
SIR Thomas, notwithstanding that he pardoned his nephew at the instance of his
neighbors, and accepted of his submission for the time, yet seeing him to grow
so absolute in knavery, he purposed to hold his nose to the grindstone, and to
keep him at hard meat, he spared his purse, and made him go thinly apparelled,
and scarcely sometimes did he allow whole clothes, but forced him to wear his
old rags for want of new, till they hung in totters about his tail. But
Dobson to remedy this necessity, enrolled his uncles name in the Drapers
book, for a suit and a cloak, which his uncle was constrained to discharge
for his credit sake. But to prevent him of that mean, he went through the
City amongst all the Clothiers and Millioners, warning them no further to
credit him, unless he bought it with ready money, the which he shall always
have, if he be sent from me: and whosoever shall let him have any upon credit,
must be glad to stand to his own peril, for i will not be answerable for any
halfe-penny thereof from hence forward. The merchants thereupon would no more
register Dobsons name, not so much as for a pair of garters, which put him
(poor man) into great discontent, and what shift to make for garments, when
these were gone, he could not devise: to ask for any of his uncle he dared
not, and he was debarred of his former project, by the which he supposed to
have ever, as he had needed, to supply that indigence. He must then take some
other course, and for once he fell to stealing, taking away a song made by one
of his fellows, which for the exquisite music therein showed, was highly
commended of the whole Queere. This he purloyning carried into the Country to
his uncle Pharoes houle, who had diverse sons and daughters that could sing,
of whose knowledge in that Arre his uncle was not a little proud. Dobson
therefore to applaud his uncles humor, presented him this Song, telling him how
himself had made the same: and he, because it was well liked of, and allowed
for good consort, that he thought it no where better bestowed than upon my
coosins your daughters. Master Pharoe thanked him, and promised to recompense
his good will: But first he called his daughters to sing it over, who with
their sweet and tuneable voices much moved their fathers affection;
themselves also were so much in love with the descant, that they requested
only to have it set in their books: but Dobson more liberal then they looked
to have found him, freely bestowed it among them, with this applause; Good
coosins, if this be pleasing unto you, I will afford you hereafter more
plenty of better stuff, this is but the simple invention of my own rude
brain, and not worthy of half this commendation: but such as it is, yours it
is with all my heart, and I think my self in your debt for your kind
acceptance thereof. His cousins thanked him again, and beseeched their father
to be bounteous toward him. He to satisfy Dobsons exspectation, and to
gratify his daughters request, clothed his kinsman Dobson in a new suite,
whereof he being heartily glad, did profess to his uncle and coosins to be
always at their command and service, and so returned to Dunholme in that
case, where he kept as much swaggering as before.

His uncle sir Thomas marvelled whence he had such a gallant suit, and who had
been so liberal toward him, desired to be informed. It is no matter, said
Dobson, (good uncle) since that now I have them, you may conjecture that I have
compassed them by my wits, and if you think I have not got them by begging,
imagine they are stolen. Sir Thomas thinking it fit no further to urge him,
suffered the matter to pass without any further question. At the same
instant, a young Gentleman, a fellow scholar of his, had a new suite of the
same color and cloth, and he was of equal make and stature with Dobson, and
their backs being toward the beholders, it was a difficulty to discern the
one from the other, wherewith Dobson was not well content to be challenged so
often for his fellow. To give the people some special note therefore how to
distinguish them, he used this mean: In the school was a great flintie stone,
upon which in the winter time this young Gentleman was accustomed to sit before
the fire: this stone one morning while the other was exercis^d in writing, and
gave no respect unto what was pr^aised, Dobson caused to be made extreme hot,
and pretending to have some matter of importance to impart to the Gentleman,
he called him to the fire, and made the stone ready for him to sit upon, who
neither fearing nor thinking of any kind of harm, satchimselfe down as he was
wont, to discourse with Dobson, who propounded a number of extrauagant
questions where with to occupy his mind, and whereby to expel from his
memory, all occasions or motives of rising from his seat, till anon the boy
felt an extraordinary heat in his buttockes, yet he sat still, while strait
he perceived that they were ready to broyle, at the which he started up half
astonished, and putting his hand behind him, to feel if his breeches were not
fired: and he perceived the greatest part of them to be burned forth, and a
great open to pass through cloth, linings, and shert, even to his naked skin.
The Boy quaked and trembled, being sore amazd with the chance, as not
conceiving how it came to pass. Dobson and his accomplices sported themselves at
the boys mis hap, and the most of Dobsons familiars in the Town, to whom
notice was given thereof, made themselves merry with the boy as he passed
before them in the streets, from the School to his Innes, and he was glad to
get a patch set upon the broken place, by which, ever after, he was known
from Dobson.

How Dobson took upon him a Gentleman's estate: and how he caused the Ale-wife
of Wittan to come before the Commissarie. Chap. 10
IT has bin a custom of old, and is yet to this day in the Schools of
Dunholme, for three Scholars every Satterday to be marshaled forth to the
woods in the country, to provide birchen rods for the correction of the
disordred and negligent: and observing a certain order therein, it passed
quite through the whole number of scholars every half year. Once Dobson in
the winter season, when the weather in those parts is commonly stormy, and the
air piercing, had always a shift to thrust another forward, and to keep
himself at home: mary in summer, when it seemed a healthful recreation, it
pleased him to keep his own turn and others too, in liew of the pains they
had taken for him in the colder time of the year. Concerning then a desire to
notify his fame among the country men and swains of the villages, one time
when he was appointed in the hinder end of the month of May, to accompany
Rakebaine and Talifere to the birch woods, he decreed with them to commit some
famous jest, for which to make himself memorable. In Witton Iilbert, for
thither they were to go for such rubbish as they wanted, and conferring with
them of the matter upon the Friday at night before, they concluded, that he
should take upon him the state of a Gentleman, and that they two should attend
him as seruitors, and respectively reverence him as their Master: determining
further, that they would banquet with some good wife for a mess of cream
before they returned; and so examining their purses, their whole stock amounted
but to only three pence, which they thought was a great deal too little, and
far insufficient to discharge their shot, they having an intention to spend
royally. But Dobson to animate them forward, willed them to refer the matter
to himself, and they should see that he would take such course, as that he
would make it serve well enough with the help of his countenance: Therefore
James (says he) thou must afford me thy best suit of apparel, thy cloak and
rapyer, to attire me withal, that there may be some difference, and that the
people may more easily conceive my gentilitie: and for you, I will borrow two
liueries, and two swords, and see that you play the seruingmen in form. When I
call or speak to you, forget not to stand with your heads uncovered: or if I
stand to piss, you must also stand bare at my back, after our English
fashion. You must worship, and good worship me at every word: to wit, you
must take occasion to inform me of somewhat to be done, and then you must
frame your speech in this form: And it please your good Worship, your Worships
Father willed me to put you in mind of a speedy return, desiring your
Worship to remember his business, etc. And if any ask you what I am, you
shall answer, that I am son to Master Chauncellor of Dunholme. And be
careful, that in no phrase of speech, gesture or carriage, that you show your
selves familiar, but attend me with all submission and reverence. And you
executing these instructions, shall see that I will procure us indeleable
respect amongst the vulgar sort, and all the towns and villages near about,
shall have cause to speak of Master Chauncellors son and his men. And having
thus received their lesson, away they go the Saturday morning toward Witton
Iilbert, Dobson in Rakebaines apparel, cloak and rapyer, and his companions in
such old liueries as he had borrowed amongst the Prebends, with two il favored
swords girt to their sides. As they passed along they were met by many
multitudes of market folks, whom that Dobson might stir them to conceive of
his gentilitie, took many occasions to talk with his men: sometimes he would
stand still, other sometimes he would hold forth right, at other times also he
would suddenly turn him about, at every which occasion they capped and kneeled
in humble and debonaire manner: diverse simple people wondered who it should be:
some said certainly he is son to some great personage, and has been
brought up in civil places, for in all our lives we have not seen a man so
much reverenced by his servants. Others beholding the carriage of his
attendants, at their meeting of him, would also cap, kneel, and bid good
morrow to his Worship: and this course of complements they continued from
Dunholme, while they came to Witton, which by computation is four miles. When
he came into the town, he asked where he might have same victuals sor
himself and his men: An Alehouse was presently showed unto him, into which he
entered, called to the goodwife to make a breakefast ready for him and his men:
she demanded what it would please his good Worship to have prepared: He
answered, that he would have some new cakes, cream, butter, and such other
things as she could afford: all which she set upon the table before him
incontinent. Master Chauncellors son and his men fell to their victuals
afresh, their stomachs were pretty good, and they quickly made rid of this
provision, and asked their Hostess what they had to pay: two pence a man (said
she) and your Worship is heartily welcome. Alas good woman, that is but six
pence in the whole: No more, and it please your Worship will I have at this
time for so slender fare (said the good wife:) Why then (said Master Dobson)
turn the cloth again, we will make her amends: so he called for more Ale,
which she brought of a nut brown color, as good as needed to be drunk, with
great store of new cakes, cream, and custard, cheese also with apples and
nuts, she placed on the table again: of all which they took so much as they
thought good, and willed her to remove the residue: then they desired again to
know their shot for altogether: she told them, that for the whole they must pay
twenty pence. What, said Master Dobson, (having but three pence to defray all)
was it now but six pence, and will thou make this last, being much worse,
trebble the first? Nay gogs heart, I will teach thee a trick for that. Good
sir (said the woman) I cannot well have less, if I should be a sauer by you,
and I trust you do not wish my loss. No (says Master Dobsen) neither yet
shall thou make a fool of me and so cousin me. But I pray tell me one thing,
have you a license to keep an alehouse? Yea sir that I have, and under master
chauncellours own hand and seal: Why and he is my father, said M. Dobson:
but seeing thou have no better a conscience than thus to extort men, I will
have it disallowed, and therefore I do charge thee, as thou will answer the
contrary, at thy peril, that upon Friday next thou make thy appearance before
my father in the Chauncery, where I will see how thou can answer this
irreligious dealing, and also have thy license surueyed, that if there can be
any advantage at all taken thereat, I will have it defaced, and thy self
punished, as thou do deserve. The poor woman starued with fear upon this
hard sentence pronounced, fell prostrate at his feet, beseeching him to pardon
her, for that she had not used him as his worshipful calling required: but
the fault was in her ignorance of his person and worth. She also prayed him to
be favorable unto her, and to take compassion of her miserable estate, for
she was mother of five small children, and had not where with all for to
maintain them, besides that poor trade, and her husbands handy labor, and
for that shot she was content with all her very heart to remitte it, and
that he should command, not only then, but at all other times, whatsoever
was within her poor house that in any respect might do him pleasure. Well
(saicty he) I scorn to offer injury, to either thee, or to any of my
inferiors: but, as I will not harm them, so they shall not abuse me. And as
for the shot I will defray it every farthing: but fail not thou to come
before my father, as I have prescribed, when I will have you better instructed
what appertains to your trade, than I conjecture you do understand. And so
go fill your shot pot, and you shall have your money. The goodwife quaking
every bone, went to her caller for more ale, but in the mean time Master
Chauncellours son leaving only three pence upon the Table for the whole
discharge, conveyed himself and his men forth of the house, and closely stole
into the woods, where every man loading himself with burch, in the eeuening
they returned to the city by a secret and private passage. The goodwife, after
they were gone, was forced to content her self with what they had left, not
knowing how to recover the residue: and careful she remained all the week
after, for her appearaunce to be made before Master Chancellor. She related
to her husband at night what accident she had that morning, his fear was
double hers, and he chafed and chid her apace, and had wel-nie beaten her, for
demanding so much, and for that she had no better respected him: for now
(says he) have thou, through thy covetousness, undone us all for ever: for if
thy license be taken from thee, as by likelihoode it must needs, we may all
go beg, and so daunted was he with the news that he could not tell how to
advise her. But going to the Church the morrow after, he asked Master Vicar
and all his neighbors counsel, desiring them to direct him what was best to
be done in this matter. They, to see their neighbor in such a difficulty,
laid their heads together, and concluded, that his wife should go and let
her license be seen, and that she also should make rehersall of all that
which had passed betwixt her and them, omitting no circumstance. And we (said
they) will all join in petition to Master Chancellor, to permit her to
prastise her trade, which petition Master Vicar presently framed, and they
confirmed, by subscribing thereto their names, and delivering it to their
neighbor. And that they might bring into some comfort whom they see clean out
of heart with the fears he conceived heerevpon, they cheered him with many
fair speeches, promising, that he should not fall, if their helps could
sustain or proppe him up. After dinner, the better to incorage him, they all
came to drink at his house, and to repair the damage which she his wife had
received by Master Dobson. And so plentifully master Vicar, and the
goodfellowes of his parish took their cups, that not a man amongst them,
but that he received a wound in his head, and for Master vicar, he was not
able for that night read his Service, but perceiving himself hurt, he
requested his hostess to fit him of a bed, for that night, whereunto she most
willingly assented. But this rested until friday morning, when up arose the
Ale-wife betimes, put on her fairest smock, peticoate of good broad red, her
gown of gray, faced with buckeram, her square thrumd hatte, and before her
she hung a clean white apron, and putting her petition into the box, with
her license, she takes her way to Dunholme, there to attend her calling in, to
answer before Master Chancellor, but there she stayed all the fore noone,
exspecting when Master Dobson would bring her to her appearance, much
maruelling that no man did acknowledge her, neither question with her as
concerning her business. She had special care to epsy Master Chauncellours
son in the throng, and not able to fix her eyes upon him, she supposed that
he was not accustomed to come abroad so early, albeit she attended there before
the Chauncery office door, from half an hour past seven in the morning,
until almost twelve, when the Court rose and went to dinner: she earnestly
desired to have a dispatch, but how to effect her desire she could not devise,
for she was unknown to all, and they in like sort were all strangers to her,
and Master Dobson had forgotten the strict charge he imposed upon her the
satterday afore-going, neither sought he to exhibit any Bill of Complaint
against her. She seeing no person to respect her, albeit she was in a
laborinth of conceits, sometimes of retiring, otherwhile of staying til she
might see the uttermost: she also thought it convenient to take a little meat
in the Town at a kinsmans house of hers there dwelling, to whom she revealed
her whole case, and requested his counsel: He thought it fit that she
should attend alittle further, to see if she were inquired after, which if you
be not coosin (said he) I will make means my self to Master Chancellor that
you may be dispatched and so depart home. At one of the clock when the Court
was to sit again, he came along with her toward the Chauncery. Master Dobson
sitting in an old freeze gown before the north gate of the Cathedral, espied
his Hostess, and remembering himself, that it was friday, imagined, without
further discourse, the cause of her being there: and being ashamed to present
himself into her sight, he closely conveyed him self from her view, yet
thought he good to ride her once again like a country jade, and thereupon he
went to one of the Clerks of the Chancery, and acquainted him with the whole
matter, desiring him to take some course for the ending of her business, and
to set her packing: for during her abode in the Town, I shall be constrained
(said he) like the Fore, to keep my hole. The Clearke promised to order the
matter wellenough, but he either forgetting himself, or troubled with so much
other business, that he could not regard it, suffered her to stay until
three of the clock uncalled for. Whereat her coosin, grieved with her
attendaunce, boldly stepped into the Chauncery, told Master Chancellor her
case, and desired his good worship, that forth of his accustomed clemency he
would let her come to her answer, that she might know what she were to trust
unto. The Chancellor hearing such reports to his sons disgrace, in
public court, was greatly offended therewith, and caused her to be brought
in, and demanded of her if she would justify those things, or not. Yea, quoth
she, I will be deposed that all these reports of my coosin be most true, and
in witness thereof, here are the hands and names of our Curate, and
principal men of our parish. Well quoth Master Chauncollour, Thou naughty
woman, I will have thee made an example to all the world for slaundering my
son with so much untruth: for the very day before thou reportest this act
to be done, I sent him to York about important business of mine own, and the
Churches, and as yet he is not returned, neither, if he had been at home
should thou make me to believe that he would have so much abused himself. O
good Master Chauncelour (said she) for the pity of almighty God, read my
testimonial, and you shall know thereby, that I have spoke nothing but the
plain truth, which if it appear not to be so, then spare no punishment. He,
although he rested assured of his sons innocence, yet because the
simpleness of the woman persuaded him that she could not contriue it, and also
seeing her so earnestly to insist upon the verification thereof, he conceived
that some had done her injury, and fathered the matter upon his son: he
therefore took her petition, and read it openly, which contained thus much in
effect.

Humbly beseeches your good worship, father Chancellor, you daily Orators, the
Vicar and parishioners of Wittan Iilbert, in the behalf of this poor woman,
our common Hostess of the same Town and Parish, that whereas, upon the five
and twentieth day of May instant, your worships sonite and sole heir,
accompanied with two men only, repaired to the house of our said Hostess,
and there calling for Ale, Cakes, Cream, Curds, Custard, Cheese, Apples and
Nuts, had all the same things afforded in plentiful manner by our said
Hostess: whereof although but three in number, and also pretending themselves
gentlemen, they ate so much as would have sufficed six stal-worth men, as with
us are set to plowe and waine, and when our hostess did demand of them (as
right would she should) but a reasonable recompense, and much less than they
had taken of hers, they quarrelled with her, and like cozoning fellows (if not
your worships son and servants) they theeuishly departed, leaving all
vndischarged except three pence, which they shamefully left on the table
behind them, whilst she was gone to fill their shot-pot, having before
threatened her to have her license disallowed, and upon this day enjoined her to
make her appearance before your worship in this Court, and there to have her
license surueied, which we beseech you to confirm, and ratify, for she is the
best Hostess that ever must be in Wittan Iilbert, and better Ale is no where
brewed than she does make; for one pot thereof taken in the morning, keeps
the heart warm all the day after: In your great charity therefore we humbly
petitioning you, as you are a worthy Chancellor, to tender all our cases, and
in regard thereof we will acquit and defray all that your son is to her
indebted for that days work; We (I say) whose names are here vnder-set.

Cum multis alijs quod nunc perscribere longum est.
The Chauncellor and Court laughed along time at the subject of this petition,
and understanding the poor wives simplicity by some peevish brain abused,
surrendered to her again her license, which she there had showed, willing her
freely to practice her trade: and for she had received wrong under the name of
his son, he repayed her with a French crown, willing her also to speak
well of the Chancellor and his friends, and assuring her that it was not his
son, but some cozoning companions who had used his sons name, to abuse her
thereby, dispatched her away. For which courtesy she humbly thanked him on her
knees, and hyed her home to acquaint her husband and neighbors of her good
success: for joy whereof they were all drunk the Sunday ensuing.

How Dobson stole a goose and Roasted her. Chap. II.
IN the suburbs of Dunholme, the Monks of the Abbey had a certain house of
recreation, in the which every month once, in the summer time, they were
assembled to pastime themselves in the orchards walks and gardens, which they
had there planted: while their orders continued undissolved: but when they were
reformed and reduced to a Deane and Chapter, they leased, and let forth all
such places to Gentlemen of the Country. This house called the Hall-yerds,
they farmed to one Monsieur du Pome, a merchant of the city, who for his house
provision had always there a house of Poultry. Dobson promised his fellows a
feast, albeit he was not always the best provided of money, so about the
Michaelmasse, when goose flesh comes into request, he made an arrand to the
Hallyerds, where such shift he made, as away he brought a goose without note or
suspicion, he shrouded it closely under his gown, and lest that either he
might be pursued, or the gander should cry and so endanger him of apprehension,
he refused the streets, and took his passage along the river side to a
bridge called Pons Laurentis, which directly carried him into the Abbey. But in
the way (as it fortuned) he was met by the owner of the same, who for his
pleasure came walking by the same passage to the Hall yerds, to take account of
his servants labors, and to see his houses and cattle. The merchant in their
meeting espying a substanre of a white color under his gown, demanded what
he had there: Nothing said Dobson, but my Surplesse, which I have been
fetching from my Laundresse, for it is almost Euensong time. That is well done
(said the merchant) and making no further question with him, they sundred, the
one taking his course to his farm, and the other to the school, where he
left his gander until Euensong was ended, when he conveyed him to his old
hoast-house at the sign of the Bore, where they got him made fit for the
broach. And upon monday morning intending to perform his promised banquet, he
provided a broach, and all other things requisite, and caused a fire to be
built in a sellar under the School, he set his fellows to work, playing the
master Cook himself, he assigned every one of those whom he had acquainted
with the matter to a several office. The goose as she began to roste more
ripely, sauored so all over the school, that master Bromeley very sensibly
perceived the same, and demanded what it should be, or from when ce it came:
no man durst bewray the truth, for fear of Dobsons indignation. But Master
Bromeley missing him and diverse others, inquired how they had bestowed
themselves. Whereunto answer was made, that they were in the lower house. He
suspecting that they were about the acting of some roguery, whirred down the
stairs, weening to have trapped them, but he found a snecke before his snowt,
the doors were so strongly boulted against him, that there he might not come
but by license. Using then his authority, he knocked lustily, and commanded
Dobson to open the doors, for he would come in to see what they had to do
there. Oh no, quoth Dobson, for Gods sake come not here sir, for you are not
able to endure the stinch of this place, it is so mighty, that it will hazard
your strangling: for this last night, in the rain which fell there are come
down such a multitude of frogs and other vermin into this house, that no man
is able to set foot upon any ground for them: and therefore, lest they should
be the cause of any infection in this house, if they should continue until
Summer, we have made a fire to burn them, whereof proceeds this terrible
stinch which you taste, and from which we pray you to absent your self. Gods
blessing have thy heart, quoth master Bromeley, I pray thee leave not one of
them alive, and when you have finished your work, let me have intelligence
thereof: for until such time as you have dispatched, I will leave the School,
and commit the performaunce of this business to thy care and providence, wherein
Dobson promised to be very vigilant and respective, glad to have so easily
possessed his master with a false suggestion: and so, when the goose was
roasted to their contentment, they ate her all to the bones, Dobson and his
best esteemd friends: which being done, they sent to advertise their Master,
that he might return at his pleasure, for they had cleared the coast of all
these misshapen monsters, and had perfumed the School with burning of
frankensence.

How Dobson devised a holiday, and endangered his fellows a whipping. Chap. 12
DObson, at eighteen years of age, had so well profited in Music, and in the
Latin tongue, that he was supposed fit for the University, whither his uncle
had intended to send him so soon as his voice changed. But he desirous to have
his name notorious in the School, and to give his fellows often cause to
speak of him after his departure, he set down with himself to play one famous
jest more among them. And having prepared their affections with this aforesaid
solemn banquet, he thought them so confident of his good meaning, that they
would never apprehend any sinister conceit of his actions. One morning
therefore about Midsummer after the ordinary prayers sung in the Cathedral,
they were marching toward the school as at other times. Dobson having fore*
thought his purpose, asked them what they intended to do, what other should
we do but go to the School? To the School, (quoth Dobson) and it a holiday?
that were sport for a Tailor: I believe you cannot make me such a fool. And
why answered they, we have heard of no such festiual, and if it be any, it is
more than we do know. Why that may very well be so: but I dare warrant you,
that it is holiday, and thereof I am most certain, for otherwise Batte
Midforths shop would have been open, as upon other working days it is wont
to be: or never since my coming to the town have I seen it shut, but upon
Sundays and principal feasts, so that I am well persuaded, that it is some
special solemmtie this day* neither is it to be doubted, but that it has
been proclaimed in the Churches, or at least in the parish of Saint Nicholas,
albeit we have not heard thereof, and that he knows welenough: for else
(without all question) his shop had not been shut in more this day than
yesterday. This Batte Midforth was of the Gentle Craft of Translators, and
cobling of boots and shoes he won his liuelihoode: every morning was he
accustomed to open his shop betimes, singing like the Nightingale, and
working apace, if, as Dobson said, it were not holiday, whereof he never
violated or brake any one, but observed them all, very devoutly frequenting the
church and sermons, at the least two times upon every such day.

This morning as it fortuned, he was gone into the Country, he and his wife,
to visit his wives mother, who labored of a quotidian fever, and fearing
death, had sent for them to be at the making of her last will and testament, as
also to see her interred according to her estate and desire. Dobson then
finding his shop windows shut up, urged it for a certain testimony to prove
thereby a holyday, knowing that a more forcible instance could not have been
by him aleadged, than that whereof themselves could all be testificants: and
thereby he so staggered their understandings, that they could not resolve what
to do. Gladly they would have apprehended the occasion of a days liberty, if
they could have devised how to have satisfied their Master of this, they knew
not what solemn Feast day, but because they could not conceive how that might
be inculcate, they passed on still toward the school. Dobson seeing them so
forward, turned his back, and bid God speed them well: for as for me you shall
go alone, let no man trust me ever while I live, if I come within the school
doors this day. They perceiving him to seem offended, told him, that they
were as willing as he to accept of the time, if they could be excused at their
Masters hands. Leave the dispatch of that matter to me (quoth Dobson) I will be
advocate for us all, if you will join with me this day, and convent some good
fellows at the Moorehouse, where I have appointed a breakefast, and a match of
shooting, I will discharge you of all blame at our Masters hands, and thereof
be you not afraid. Upon which condition they al agreed to attend him, which way
soever it liked him to go. Well then (s^id he) fet your bows, and walk toward
the Bellows mede: if I be not there before you, fa^l to shoot till my coming.
In the mean time I will attend at the School door till our Masters repair,
to whom I will show how it is holyday: which done, I will not be long absent
from you, when we will go to the place appointed. Every man allowing this
course, fet his artillery, and marched forth of the Abbey, with whom Dobson
went along, even until they came almost to the place where he had assigned
them to stay: then he returned to inform Master Bromley as he promised of the
festival: and making as much have as possibly he could, to prevent his
Masters coming, he took his seat close at the School door, lapped in his
gown as he had been a cold. About the hour of eight of the clock Master
Bromeley came and bid him good morrow, demanding the cause of his sitting
there alone, and why he was not in the School? Sir (says he) the door is
shut, and I cannot tell how to enter, and all the residue of my fellows be gone
abroad to shoot, and would have had me to accompany them, affirming it to be
holyday: But because I could not tell what festival it should be, neither have
heard that it was so published in any Church of the Town, I dared not presume
to go with them: partly, because I feared your offense, and partly, because I
could not imagine what holyday it should be, for I espy all sorts of Citizens
and Artizans in their shops, as upon working days: yet notwithstanding all the
reasons I produced to overthrow such their opinion, I could not persuade them
to stay till your pleasure therein were known. But laughing at my timors, away
they went globating to the fields. Master Bromeley first examining the day and
time of the year, lest happily it might be some Apostles or other Saints day:
that either by the prescript of the Church, or the general custom of the
Country, was to be kept holy, could not call to his remembrance that it was any
such: and therefore he gave Dobson in commission, to go and command them all
to repair to the School: with which his charge he departed, leaving his
Master to walk his stations before the portall. When he came to the place
where they were earnestly shooting: Gentles (said he) I am come from our
Master, to entreat your helps a little. There are diverse Gentlemen of good
sort yesternight come from London, who are traveling toward Barwicke: and they
have sought forth our Master this morning betimes, desiring to see our
School, and the number of scholars, requesting also that we may give them a
song: and have brought themselves diversity of descant, lately set forth by
Master Bird Doctor of our Art. Our Master did know it to be holyday before I
told him, and therefore was much solicited how to get us assembled together
because of the same. That he might gratify the strangers desires, and for joy
that I was so nigh at hand, he has promised us another day of recreation, when
we shall think fit to call for the same. They taking all his sentences for
Oracles, without further delay, in hope of their Masters future favor, and
some reward of the Gentlemen, hurled homeward in heaps, bestowing their
artillery to the custody of their acquaintances in the way, striving who
should come first home. But when they came within the Cathedral, and did see
their master keeping his ward alone, their copies changde, and wished with all
their hearts they had been away: but Dobson seeing them to be so daunted,
encouraged them to go forward, implying to them, that the strangers were but
gone to take a view of some of the ancient monuments in the Chancellor shrine
of S. Cuthbert till their coming: and to release them of all fears, himself
stepped foremost into the School. When every man was seated in his place,
disputing what would be the issue of their calling home, M. Bromeley bolting
the door so fast that none could escape forth, examined the cause, why they
had neglected the school without his license, and did not rather follow
Dobsons advise, which was, to have acquainted him first, that it was a
solemnity of some Saint, either kept of custom, or commanded, which if by
their collections they could have made plain, then he would not have detained
them against any ancient and approved custom of the School. They by these
propositions seating how the case stood, had no better excuse to clear
themselves, then to blame the blameworthy, and so at large related, how by him
they were induced thereunto, standing all to affirm it in his face, and their
testimonies so strongly charging him, could not descerne any fault in them
worthy of chastisment, but turned all his anger upon this pregnant deviser, who
well merited the whip, and was commanded to prepare his breech for the
strappado. But when he perceived that no reply of his against their assertion
could be taken, neither any entreatie or promise of amendment procure his
pardon, he skipped into an old Jakes in the School, whereinto they used to
throw all their filthy dust and sweepings, protesting that forth of that
place he would never come, unless that his master would solemnly swear to
remit and forgive unto him all offenses past: and if that any disaster shall
ouer-take me in this place (says he) I will take it upon my death, that the
fear I conceive of your barbarous usage of me is the cause thereof, answer it
as you can; you will find that I have parents will seek for no less
satisfaction then the law will allow them. M. Bromeley doubtful that he had
been mad or lunaticke by his desperate behauior, entreated him to come
forth, swearing upon the Bible, that he would not only release him, but
pardon all the rest: upon which his deposition made, Dobson by the help of a
rope which was cast down unto him* ascended forth of the pit, and was
reconciled to his Ma. and school fellows. After which time he desisted from
further practizing against them, being sent by his Uncle within a weeks space
to the Vuiuersitie of Cambridge.

Of Dobsons intertainment at Cambridge: and of his disputes there kept in the
public Schools. Chap. 13.
SIr Thomas being let to understand, by the Masters of the Schools, that his
nephew was fit for the University, acquainted M. Deane therewith, requesting
his good help and furtherance toward his placing in some good estate, whereby
he might be the rather moved to continue and set himself to his studies with
more facility, such impediments being cut off as a number, who forced to
attend, in respect of their lack of maintenance, can hardly allot themselves
any time to their books. And therefore he prayed Master Deane to commend him
by Letters to such his friends as his worship did know could stead him for his
promoting to a schollership, when the time of Election should come, that he
might have that help, together with the money which he had reserved of his
Chorisiers stipend for his exhibition, which there he made account of to
master Deane, that he entirely saved and kept it according as his worship
had commanded for that end and purpose. Master Deane, for sir Thomas his
sake, whom he loved more than any Canonist in the church, was willing to do
whatsoever he desired, is far forth, as his Letters and credit in those
places would extend: and at the time of his setting forward, forth of his own
coffers he gave unto him as toward his viaticum, ten marks in liberality,
and five other to bestow upon his study: he writ also in friendly manner to the
Master and Fellows of Christ's College, entreating them to entertain him as
his poor scholar, and that when a Scholership came into their gift, which by
the statutes of their house they might dispose of, he then desired that (no
misdemeanor of him to the contrary them inhibiting) to admit him thereunto, and
himself would take it as a favor extended unto him, neither would be
negligent in the requital of such a courtesy. And before he sealed, he read
them unto sir Thomas, who humbly thanked him for these undeserved favors,
promising, that for such his worshipful goodness and respect, he and his
nephew should remain his daily beadsmen until death. And receiving the money
and letters of Master Deane, he took his leave, and the next day he
dispatched away Dobson, with diverse others that intended the same course,
waging a carrier to conduct and guide them thither, where he found as good
welcome as could be wished for, in regard of master Deanes Letters, the
effect of which every man desired to accomplish, and the Master himself
assigned him a Tutor, and carefully supplied all his wants, assuming him into a
Scholars place, by the assent of all the fellows within three weeks of his
coming thither, although that the time of Election was not until Michaelmasse
after, a full half year from the time of his installing. He carried himself
very respectively til he had perfitly learned all the customs and fashions of
the University, and so diligently settled himself to his book, as by the
estimate of all he was accounted the best Student in the House, and so exact
he became in the interpreters of the Logic and Philosophy, that there was not
one of his class able to equal him in dispute, or canuasse an Argument with
such dexterity. In this course did he keep himself three years, until he
was called to the public schools, to hold his disputes in open audience of
the University, when he rushed again into his old humors. And the first
that opposed himself to Dobson in the Schools was a Welchman: the first. of
whose questions was: An aer sit substantia corporea: Dobson answered: If Wallus
may be Gallus, aer sit substantia corporea.

The Welchman cauelled again, until by the Moderator they were enjoined to
go to the question, and to dispute it syllogistice. The opponent urging an
argument very captiously, was taken at the rebound, and beaten with his own
Racket. Dobson escrying the Eleuch, showed him the falsitie of the Sophisme,
and made him clear with a distinction: and so, that staff being broken, he
took a stronger by the end (as he imagined) but herein Dobson so abased him,
that the Welchman descended the Pulpit, and would feign have pulled him by the
ears, if by the audience he had not been interrupted, who persuaded him the
contrary, wherein (no doubt) they were greatly his hinderance, for if his
charity had been to have lent, I conjecture he should have had his own
repaied with vsurio. Dobson prepared to have restored him the courtesy of the
town, and bearing a gentlemanly mind, he resolved to have bestowed two for
one, scorning to be in his debt. And of mere good will, to provoke the
Welchmans appetite, he had brought with him, in a little linen bag, a
penyworth of cheese, and asise of bread, which at the propounding of the second
Argument, taking the bag forth of his pocket, he spread it upon the pulpit,
and set thercon the bread and cheese, and said, because I thought by your
complexion, that there was some diet which troubled your stomach for want of
temperd digestion, I have provided for you; Porrige igitur and manduca, gratias
agens; reach to therefore, and eat, giving thanks. It were pity your mother
should lose a son by a surffet. Charity then has moved me to prescribe you
the best physic I know of: and sure it is most correspondent to a man of your
constitution. Ajax perceiving it a vanity to deal with Ulysses, offered him
the Gauntlet, and forsaking his piew, with folded fist he made toward Dobson
with a buffet, who met at the half sword: but they had scarcely changed a
couple of blows, but they were divided, and commanded, either to proceed
informa, or to give place to some better prepared, Dobson retired to his
settle, exspecting another Argument. But the Welsh man was without; his brains
were troubled with this object, that for his life he could not frame any
further dispute, and so descending with disgrace for that time he departed the
Schools, but Dobson continued forth his time, answering all opponents
whatsoever, and so sufficiently, and with such learning, that his fame
thereupon grew to be great in the general opinion of the University, and the
Welsh man generally for ever after avoided to take the pulpit against him.

Of Dobsons second dispute against the Kentishmen: of his abuse of them: and of
his sending to Bocardo. Chap. 14.
IN the term following, he was assigned to be defendant in questions of
philosophy against certain Kentishmen, with whom he conceived to have a more
doubtful conflict, knowing the most part of them to be serious students,
captious, pregnant, courageous, and endowed with singular quick apprehensions,
and so many in number that he feared to be suppressed with multitudes, yet
notwithstanding he devised how to close their mouths with a cover of plate;
and albeit they might hap to insult over him, by their speculatiue knowledge,
yet in practical sciences he was confident to have the superiority. And
against the day of his conference with them he thus provided, he went to a
painter in the city, and procured him to draw at large and in lively colors,
a kennell of Foxes, marching in array of battle and laden with the spotles
of their enemies, in the foreward was Reynold with a Caualieros cap of tawny
hue, circled with a band of gold and pearl, to which was fastened a bunch of
black and red feathers, importing death, and over spreading his crown, like a
canopy, in his mouth he carried by the neck two slaughtered soldiers, the one
a white ga^der whose body he had hung upon his right shoulder behind, and upon
the left he bare the corpse of a very fair red cock, with some black and
white freakles upon the breast, and at the ioyuture of his tail to the ridge
bone, they had placed (like a Portmantua) the carcasses of half a dozen younger
poultry: all which by maine force he had taken in the fight, and put to the
sword: with him was ranked on the left hand, dame Ermeline his wife, clothed in
a gown of gray cundested satin: her hat was white, and the band of siluered
tinzell, with a bunch of blew and yellow feathers, which ouer-shadowed her
brows forward, and detended her face from the scorching heat of the sun,
she reputing her self in prowess nothing inferior to sir Reynold, and that
the worl^ might bear witness that her valor was such: he had spotles also to
testify the same, a gray goole, and a speckled hen, with sire sister chickens,
whom by dim of sword, she had subdued and slaughtered. After them followed in
good order a litter of young Cubbes every one whereof gave testimony by their
abundance of prey, that a great overthrow had been given to their enemies, and
that the victory was wholly theirs, some carried the spoils of the conies,
other of Duckes, and some Pigeons, only the hind most was plagued skipping
at a bunch of grapes, but could not catch them: their tails were painted of a
large and ample sise, brushing the ground where they seemed to pace; and upon
the flourish of each thereof which bunched thick, toward the end was
artificially devised inscriptions, containing their names, offices, and the
exploites by them atchiued, and the arms of Kent in white and blew stremers,
in a field of Sable.

When all these things were thus done (as he directed) he discharged the
Painter for his worke-manship, and conveyed the Pagient to his chamber, till
the day of his answer of the Kentish opponent: when the time prefixed came,
they repaired to the schools, a little before the hour appointed, and caused
a screene to be set upright in veiw of his adversary, he fastened thereupon in
a table of wood the foresaid pageant, drawing a veil before it, to keep it
forth of sight, until he thought fit to discover it, certain Poemes he
annexed as examplifications of the Pageant: which because I will not be
offensive to the Kentish-men, I pass over to a double post. When the clock
had stricken, and they flocked to the Schools from every College of the
University, to hear the questions in controversy decided betwixt the
Northern and Kentishmen, Dobson was elected Primate of the Northern
companies, who came as defendants: and as beseemed a noble hearted Combatant, he
entered the listes courageously, animating his fellows to second him in
semblable fortitudes and magnanimity, and with un daunted spirits, promising
so to blunt al their weapons that not one should have power to pierce him. And
because it concerned the credit of himself and all his countreimen, he kept
his acts with as much good order and formality as he could possibly make
show of: and such excess of learning he showed in the whole placing thereof,
as all admired his singular science and knowledge: he put down and drove two
of the^ to a non plus, the third ascended the piew, whom also he quickly
shifted from the Saddle: and because he would have no commendations perished,
by any of his fellows which himself had purchased, he unmasked the scieene,
and laid to there view the Kentish description, at which sight all the audience
swelled with laughing. But the kentishmen not brookeing this abuse, without any
further prosecuting of their questions, made an uproar in the Schools, and
having no other weapons but their fists, they went to good sad buffets the
Northern and Kentishmen, neither could all the residue set them asunder,
until the porters were sent for by whom they were admonished to desist, and
for that time expelled the Schools, Dobson and some others of the principals
of both parties were sent to Bocardo, where they remained until course was
taken for their good behavior in the Schools in all futurity of times.

How Dobson kept his third dispute in public Schools against one Malgrado, a
fellow student of Christ's College, and of his expelling the University. Chap.
15
THe Master of Christ's College became Dobsons security, upon promise to
forbear these prouocations of brawles, which if he did not, he threatened to
stay his Bachelors grace, and to expel him the College, depriving him of all
means of further progace and maintenance, which inhibition he nothing
respected. The very next time he was enjoined to keep his third act in
public, in which he was to deal with one of his own College, with whom alas
he knew a fault, and therefore more boldly adventured to play the wanton,
contrary to the Masters admonishment. This Malgrado (for so was the other
disputant surnamed) loved a Laundresse daughter of the College, whom he many
times harbored in his chamber, contrary to the statutes of their house: and at
such times when she came either to fet or bring his clothes to or from washing,
he would privily convey her into his study, as opportunity best fitted his
purpose, and there many times the accompanied him for the space of four or
five days, and sometimes more, being let of fit dispatching her away by
some of his fellows, whom upon some extraordinary kindness noted betwixt
them, privily watched their familiar usage of one another, to whom he gave
diligent respect that they might not take him napping. Dobson suggesting all
occasions he could advise upon, to bolt forth the truth, at last catched the
Cat in the Mouse-fall. Malgrado living in Pensioners common, when it pleased
his guest to diet with him, was accustomed to sise either of the Cooks, or
amongst the Scholars a whole mess of meat, which his large provision first
bred observation, and after betrayed his cause; for Dobson and his associats by
this means discovered the Cat in a casket: which came thus to pass. One
Sunday at the afternoon, when the most part of Students were gone abroad, some
to hear Sermons, other to take the air in the fields, as every man's
disposition allotted him, Malgrado had appointed his friend to resort to his
chamber, into the which he safely conducted her in respect of their absence,
purposing that while they continued at the Sermons, he would that with her a
little, and so dismiss her before their return: But such content he took in
her company, that he forgot himself, and was forced to stay her all the night:
for at evening time they al came home to the College, because no man durst
absent himself from prayer, and so Malgrado was constrained to go thither
also, suspecting that if he abstained, it might occasionate his chamber to be
searched, and then it was not possible for his friend to avoid their sight, he
having no conueyance wherein to conceal her, but only a basket which he hung
aloft in his chamber, binding it with two strong ropes to a cross beam,
wherein usually he thrust her, if he feared the presence of any of his
fellows, having so devised, that the end of the rope passing through the wall
of his study, he might wind up and down the basket at his pleasure. He
therefore compelld to keep her til he might gain a convenient time to set her
packing, was urged that night to sise double commons, and from the Cooks he
carried a shoulder of mutton, not without the observation of Dobson and diverse
of his fellows, who said nothing whereby he might perceive their suspicions,
yet assured themselves that mistress Debora was a bidden guest. And when they
conceived him and his familiar to be in the midst of their supper, up the
stairs they rushed with a Porters staste to have carried them both to the Tole
boothe, but he prevented their soden entrance, by bolting the door against
them, which he kept shut until he had bestowed her into the basket, and drawn
it up as high as the beam whereunto it was fastened: which done he set open
the doors and let them enter, and to search his chamber in every corner, but
they could find nothing, till being ready to depart, says Dobson, fellow
Malgrado, I supposed that you shed a shoulder of mutton to supper, what have
you done with the remainder, surely my commons were so stender, that I intended
at my coming hither to have mended my fare with you, if this unruly rabble had
not interrupted me: and therefore I pray thee if thou have any left, let us
have it, and we will fetch some beer and be merry. Faith (says Malgrado) I
have left some little, but that I have given to my Cat, which I keep here in
my basket to kill my Rats, and she I think by this has pared the residue to
the bone. If that be so said Dobson, then did thou either eat very much, or
thy Cat was greatly hungry. But I pray thee let us see, it shall be very sore
fowled, if I take not part with her of that which is behind. But Malgrado
fearing that his pelicies would appear, crcused the matter, and said, that it
could not be but that the Cat had made it past man's eating. Notwithstanding
(said Dobson) I will not believe it, unless I see it, neither shall this shift
serve to save your vinuals, and making no more to do, cut the rope in sunder
with a Halbert, when down came Mistress Debora in the basket, and in her fall
she cried, O help friend Malgrado, or I perish, but she had no supporters
until she came upon the chamber where she was relieved with more attendanes
then she desired, and that the truth of her coming thither might be
manifested, the Masters and fellows were sent for to take her examination, who
having really confessed her acquaintance and familiarity with Malgrado, with
promise never more to frequent his company (especially in the College) she was
let to go without further punishment, and Malgrado was admonished upon the
pain of expulsion to abstain from such acquaintance with all women
whatsoever, during the time of his stay in the College. Dobson therefore
having this blot in Malgradoes book, versified upon this theme at large in
the public audience, upon the day of their dispute, and to quite Malgradoes
oratory who excelled Dobson in Rethoricke, yea and in railing too, when they
had disputed their first question, Dobson drew forth from under his gown a
basket which of purpose he had provided, and lifting up the cover, forth
skippeth a Cat, offering to run away, but Dobson catching her by the tail,
said, nay I beseech you to stay good Mistress Debora, you shall suppe before you
pass, for your familiar friend Malgrado has sised a shoulder of motton which
he drawing forth of the basket preferred to the poor amassed Cat, who shreeking
and crying scratched him by the fingers until she was delivered: the Schools
were admired of the mystery, neither did any man know what co^struction to
give thereto, while Dobson unfolded all the former circumstances, which the
audience hearing, thrust Malgrado from the Pulpit and gave Dobson a general
applause, as well for his learned disputes as his commicall conceits. But
Malgrado complained of this disorder to the Master of their house, who
considering, that not only Malgrado, but the whole house, by this discovery
were made ridiculous to the whole University, by thassent of the whole Chapter
expelled Dobson both the College and the University at the very instant when
he should have proceeded Bachelour. Dobson taking in evil part this disgrace,
against the day of the Bachelours commencement, he set upon the College gates
the picture of Malgrado with a Bachelours cappe and gown, in his right hand
holding Mistress Debora in a basket, and in the other a Cat tied in a chain
with a shoulder of mutton about her neck, about him he placed the picturs of
the mistress of the house and the fellows in their Doctors roabes, with
coxecombes upon the crowns of their cappes, and in each man's hand a fox tail,
and a pair of sheeres, this statue he erected an hour before day, and so
took him to his heels, lest if he were caught he should be punished for the
same, bidding Cambridge and the Schools adieu.

How Dobson became an Oastler and a seruingman, how he beat his Mistress for
the love of her maid, and how he should have hanged for riding away with his
Masters horse, and of his end. The last Chap.
DObson being in this manner banished the University, not daring to look upon
his Uncle, and ashamed to return to his Country in this dishonor, when he
came at Huntington, he hired himself to an Inkeeper where he played the under
Oastler for the space of a year to his great grief and discontent, until a
Gentleman of his country pitying that so able a boy, and well qualified as by
his discourse and carriadge he seemed to be, should so basely bestow himself
persuaded him to give over that trade of life, and to become a seruingman,
which he told him was a more commendable course, less painful, and could not
be otherwise then more profitable also. Dobson soon assented to his persuasion
having used the other but of mere necessity, and because he did not know how
to live otherwise, the gentleman therefore concluding with him for reasonable
wages, secretly conueighed him from Huntington to his own house, with whom he
stayed the space of another year also, in which time for his diligence and
behavior he got a singular opinion both of his Master and Mistress, until
this had happened. His Mistress had a cosen who attended her in the chamber, an
hansome girl, with whom Dobson came more familiarly acquainted then was
allowed of, and also she afforded him equal affection and love, which caused
her to have many a lowering countenance of her Aunte, but she set light of them
in regard of Dobsons favor, much difficulty he suffered before he could impart
his mind to her, which had not needed if he had been assured of the maids
good meaning toward him, who if modesty had not let her, had first moved the
suite to him, and never paused after his first motion made to give him answers
or to advise of the matter, but protested at the very instant to be his
affected and pawned the same with a kiss, yet they concluded to dissemble the
same, and to keep it secret from their Master and Mistress. But love like the
fire, first smoking, and then flaming, increased so betwixt them that it burst
forth to open view of all: their exterior shows betrayed their interior
secrets, and so apparent it was to the whole house, that their Master and
Mistress had information of the same, which the Mistress ill disgested in respect
she was her Niece, and he a stranger unknown to any of them, either his
estate, condition, or parentage, which he willingly concealed because he would
not have his Uncle to receive any certificat of his course of life, she
therefore strictly commanded her Cosen to absteyne from his company, and in no
sort to use him familiarly, as she cared to avoid her final displeasure, but
this charge was of as much force as if she had taken wood and thrown into the
flame forbidding it to burn, for women are never earnest in love until such
time as they be forbidden to love. When therefore her mistress had abriged her of
al means of speaking with him in the house, appointed to meet him at the pen
when the maids came to milking, where she to gratify their fellows and the
rather to induce them to conceal their meetinges, for her Mistress did diverse
times feast and banquet them with possets and the like conceits. But in all
societies there are ever some false brothers, when to pick a thank, or to
gain a particular favor to themselves, dissupplant their fellows, so among
these maids there was one chattering pie, who thrust into the mistress head al
their intercourse of love and familiarity which then passed, for which the
poor wench had many a sound chiding, yet stood to deny all, so long that her
constant negative one night moved her mistress to put upon her a woman's attire,
and secretly to convey herself into a Calfehouse, hiding her self in the
straw under the cribbe, until the time of milcking, purposing to try whet^^r
her cosen or the maid were in the truth. And the same night they had assigned
Dobson to be present at a posset of sack, never suspecting that their mistress
had any notice of their good fellowship in that place, much less that she was
present to behold their pastimes. But only she who had set her to the watch.
While Dobson stayed longer than the hour assigned, they thought fit to make an
end of milkeing, that when he came they might have nothing to stay them
further, then only the dispatch of the posset, and also, lest staying later
abroad then they were accustomed, their mistress might have iealosie of some
such matter. One of the maids, she who had first milked, went into the
calfehouse to pull a rose, and as it would be, she pist into her mistress neck
unknown to her, while at her going forth, she had a glimse of one lying
covered in the straw, at which both ashamed and afraid she came forth and
related what had befalle^ her, some laughed at the case a little, others cared
how to dispose of the posset, tushe says her cosen, love making her bold, if
the case be so plain, let us stand to it like frindes, let them flinch that
fears, we will take no knowledge of her presence, God be thanked we know the
worst, it is but the loss of a service, a chiding, a bundel of batts, and
start I will not til my friend come, if it be not till midnight, I will either
urge her to come and take part with us, or weary her of her lodging, but
presently hereupon appears sir Dobson whom he much blamed for his lingering,
withal, revealing on what difficulties they stood upon, in regard their
mistress had set watch to trap them, no matter said he, let us first conquer
this adversary, and refer me to pacify our mistress anger, I know a card
wherewith to cool the heat of my mistress fiery stomach. And so when the
banquetended, willing them to walk homewarde, he with a good fast cudgel
entered the calfehouse, where with many a lusty blow he happed his mistress
about the shoulders, notwithstanding that she entreated him to stay his hands
and not to beat her being his mistress, no quoth he thou art some visarde
witch, that pretendest some mischief to my mistress her beasts, or else some
naughty pack queen, in league with the maids, to cosen my mistress of the
milk. My mistress is a gentlewoman of good worship, and would not for the
world be seen in this base and ragged attire, and therefore I will hamper thee
like as thou art, and so doubling his blows he beat her again till himself
was weary, and she so lamed that she was not able to stand, but falling down
upon her knees, she said, O good George I pray thee to take some pity upon me
and kill me not forth-right, for in very truth I am thy mistress, and came of
purpose in this disguised and ragged clothing, to epsy and see thy vsege and
behavior with my maids, to whom I am contented to remit as to thee all that
ever you have trespassed against me, conditionally that thou now cease from
beating me, and help to conduct me home, for thou have so squeized me that I am
not able to go alone, he seemeing by these speeches to be brought into some
doubt that it should be his mistress indeed, carried her into the light where
beholding her in the visage as though before he had not known her, he cried
her mercy, and appeared very sorrowful, requesting her to pardon him,
affirming that he did not believe that it should be her self, but some other
rogish ill disposed woman, and prostrating himself upon his knees he asked her
heartily forgiveness (as she supposd) and that he had beat her of ignorance,
wherewith she the more easily pardoned him, and staying her self upon his
shoulders she walked home with him, but he had so basted her, as for five
weeks after, she was constrained to keep her bed, in which time she was
informed of the whole betwirt him and her maids as touching her beating, for
which atterwards the could never endure him, and to curb his desires she
privately caused her kinswoman to be conueighed away he did not know whither,
for which he became so discontent, that when his master was upon occasions gone
toward London his mistress sending him to a cosens house about some business,
he rode away with his masters best gelding, sold him also and spent the money
never returning to give answer of his message: his master at his coming back
from London, made dilligent enquiry after his man and his horse, and at the
length being certified of his aboade, and the sale of his horse, he arested him
with a Justices warrant, and got him committed to the Castle at York, where he
was to answer the assizes, and had hanged without remission, if his uncle had
not made means for his repriue until he procured him a pardon. For after that
he was hanckeled in so great extremity, he directed letters to his uncle,
certifieng him of his lamentable case craueing pardon for all his former
euagations, and promising future reformation and to reclaim himself from al
lewd behauiours, desiring also his uncle to provide him a Channons place in
Dunholme, whereby he might be maintained sufficiently if he escaped death, and
that through want he needed not be constrained to prosecute any more such
barbarous courses. Nature and pity concurring in his uncles breast enforced
him to afford his helping hand. And by master Deanes means and the Prebends he
got him freed from death, and imprisonment, and also beneficed in the Abbey, as
he requested. Whereupon entering into consideration how much Almighty God and
his frindes had helped him, he mortified all his irregular passions and spent
the residue of his course in an admirable course of ciuility. For the which he
was generally respected of all the people and the whole Clergy, and after the
death of his Vnkell, possessed of all his substance and beneficed with his
Vicarige, in which estate he ended and finished his life.

Finis.
