By the King.
A Proclamation for the better making of Saltpeter within this Kingdom.
FOrasmuch as the making of Saltpeter and Gunpowder, within Our own Realms
and Dominions, is a great safety and benefit to Us and Our Subjects, assuring
Us of a certain and sufficient provision thereof for Our and their defense,
whereas the providing thereof from foreign parts, cannot but be full of
difficulty and danger, depending upon the pleasure of other Princes and States,
and when Our necessity shall most require the same, We shall be sure to
purchase so precious a Commodity, at unreasonable Rates, and be enforced to
pay ready Moneys, to be transported from hence, for the same, to the diminution
of the Treasure of Our Realms: And if none of these inconveniences should
happen, yet the bringing thereof by Sea, from foreign parts, is full of peril
and hazard, being subject to the many casualties of Wind and Weather, the
dangers of Shipwreck, and the interception of Pirates and enemies, and these
may happen in times of our greatest necessity and want thereof.

And whereas the practice and making of Saltpeter heretofore within this
Kingdom, was, and is such, as tends much to the trouble, and grieuance of
Our loving Subjects, by digging up of their dwelling Houses, Douehouses, and
other outhouses, and also to their great charge, by removing of their Liquors,
Tubbes, and other Instruments, by cariages from place to place; Of which,
although many complaints have been made, and often renewed, and all fit
courses have been taken by Us and Our Privy Counsel, to ease Our Subjects of
this trouble and charge, yet in a case of such inevitable necessity, the same
cannot yet be totally taken away.

And whereas sithence the first making of Saltpeter within this Realm, until
this present, notwithstanding all the trouble and charge aforesaid, yet the
Undertakers of the said Works, could never heretofore furnish this Realm,
with a third part of the Saltpeter requisite for the service of Our own
Dominions, especially in times of War, and greatest necessity thereof, But
We, and Our Predecessors and Subjects, have been forced for their necessary
use, to seek supplies thereof from foreign parts, which has the rather
happened, for that many to avoid the trouble of digging up their floores, have
purposely prevented the growth thereof, and diverse of the Saltpeter men, have
corruptly made a practice, to take Composition money of diverse, to forbear
digging, or to execute their Commissions, which their partial course of
proceeding, has been very offensive to many of Our good Subjects, and if now
the Saltpeter-men should continue in their accustomed course of working, and
should strive to provide so great quantity of Saltpeter within these our
Realms, for a few years together, as the necessity of the present times
require, they would so impouerish the earth, fit for that purpose, that within
a short time, We should be utterly destitute of that inestimable Treasure,
there being no artificial means used for the enriching of the Earth to this
use, the Earth of itself, by that which casually happens, not being able to
engender that matter whereof Saltpeter can be extracted in many years.

And whereas for the redress of these many inconveniences and grieuances, Sir
John Brook knight, and Thomas Russell Esquire, have humbly offered their
service unto us, and did undertake, both to us, and to the Lords Spiritual and
Temporal, assembled in the late meeting in Parliament, by their industry and
charge, to make yearly such quantities of Saltpeter, and of such good
condition, as should be sufficient both for Our own and Our Subjects uses,
with supply also of Our foreign neighbors in amity with Us, if occasion
should so require, and that without digging any of Our Subjects houses, or
outhouses of any kind, or charging them at all with cariages, as heretofore
they have been, and yet are charged, to be effected and brought to pass by a
new invention of them, the said Sir John Brook and Thomas Russell, And of
their abilities to perform the same, they then gave both to Our self and to
the said Lords Spiritual and Temrall good probability, and have sithence made
sufficient and demonstratiue proof thereof.

And We have been graciously pleased by Our Letters Patents under the great
Seal of England, bearing date the six and twentieth day of April last past,
(in compensation of their great pains and expense therein, and for
encouragement of them, and all others to bend their studies to so profitable
and public works, to the defense and benefit of Us and Our Subjects) to
grant to them, the said Sir John Brook and Thomas Russell, the sole Privilege
of making Saltpeter, according to their said new Invention, for diverse years
yet to come, with addition of such Privileges and aid on Our behalf, as the
merit of so worthy an undertaking justly challenges at Our hands, especially
for their supply of such Requisites, as shall be therein necessary without
charge to Our Subjects.

And now by their humble Petition they have required none other assistance from
Us, but that they might by Our Royal authority be provided of sufficient
quantities of Urine, which will be useful for them to the extracting and
making of Saltpeter, They the said Sir John Brook and Thomas Russell, and
their assigns, at their charges carrying away the said Urine, at due and
convenient times, from the several places where the same shall be saved for
their use, unto the place, or places where they shall have occasion to use the
same; Which their humble Suite, We having taken into Our serious and Princely
consideration, have thought fit, in a case of so great consequence, and for the
redeeming of so great and continual a charge and trouble, to Our loving
Subjects to grant the same.

And therefore We do hereby publish and declare Our Royal pleasure to be,
and We do strictly charge and command all and every of Our Subjects,
inhabiting within Our Cities of London and Westminster, and the Suburbs of
either of them, with the Borough of Southwarke and all other places of the said
Cities, and suburbs, as well within liberties as without (near unto which, the
said Sir John Brook and Thomas Russell, have already erected a work for the
making of Saltpeter,) and also all other Our loving Subjects inhabiting within
all and every other Cities, Towns, and Villages, within this Our Realm of
England, That they and every of them, from and after notice given unto them
severally and respectively, or left for them at their dwelling houses, shall
carefully and constantly keep and preserve, in some convenient vessels, or
receptacles fit for that purpose, All the Urine of man during the whole year,
and all the State of Beasts, which they can save, and gather together, whilst
their Beasts are in their stables or stalles; And that they be careful to use
the best means they may, for the saving, gathering together, and preserving of
the said Urine and Stale, without any mixture of water, or other things to be
put therein; Which Our Commandment and Royal pleasure, being so easy to be
observed, and so necessary for the public service of Us, and Our people, We
expect and straightly charge, shall be duly and carefully observed and
performed; And if any person shall be remiss or negligent in the due
observance hereof, We shall esteem of all such as persons contemptuous and ill
affected both to Our Person and State, and are resolved to proceed to the
punishment of every such offender, with that severity which by the Laws of
this Realm, or by Our Prerogative Royal We may.

Nevertheless, Our will and pleasure is, That no person shall incur any
contempt concerning the premises, unless notice be first given, or left unto
or for him or her, as aforesaid, by the Constable or Headborough of that parish
or place where such person dwells or inhabiteth, and unless the said Sir
John Brook, and Thomas Russell, or their assigns, do once in every four and
twenty hours in the Summer time, (that is to say) from the first of April,
until the first day of October, and once in every eight and forty hours in
the Winter time, (that is to say) from the first of October, until the first
of April in every year, carry away the same from those places where the same
shall be so preserved for them: And therefore We do hereby require and
command all Constables and Headboroughs, That they and every of them, upon
request made to them or any of them by the said, Sir John Brook and Thomas
Russell, or their assigns, be aiding, assisting, and diligent in the execution
of Our pleasure herein before declared, as they and every of them will answer
the contrary at their perils.

Given at Our Court at Whitehall, the second day of January, in the second
year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France, and Ireland.
God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. M.DC.XXVI.
