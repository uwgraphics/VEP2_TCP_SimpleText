A Proclamation concerning Tobacco.
WHereas Our Commons, assembled in Our last Sessions of Parliament, became
humble Petitioners unto Us, That, for many weighty reasons, much concerning
the welfare of Our Kingdom, and the Trade thereof, We would by Our Royal
power, utterly prohibit the use of all foreign Tobacco, which is not of the
growth of Our own Dominions; And whereas We have upon all occasions made
known Our dislike, We have ever had of the use of Tobacco in general, as
tending to the corruption both of the health and manners of Our people, and to
that purpose have at several times heretofore prohibited the planting of
Tobacco, both in England and Wales, as utterly unfit, in respect of the
Climate, to cherish the same for any medicinal use, (which is the only good
to be approved in it;) And at other times have also prohibited the disorderly
Trading for Tobacco, into the parts beyond the Seas, as by Our several
Proclamations, published to that purpose, it may appear. Nevertheless,
because We have been earnestly and often importuned by many of Our loving
Subjects, Planters and Adventurers in Virginia, and the Summer Islands, and
lately by Our Commissioners for Virginia, that We would be pleased to take into
Our Royal care that part of Our Dominions, by Our Royal authority, and by
the industry of Our loyal Subjects, added to the rest of Our Empire, for the
propagation of Christian Religion, and the ease and benefit of this populous
Realm, and to consider, that those Colonies and Plantations, are yet but in
their infancy, and cannot be brought to maturitie and perfection, unless We
will be pleased for a time to tolerate unto them the planting and venting of
the Tobacco, which is, and shall be of the growth of those Colonies and
Plantations; We, taking into Our Princely consideration these, and many other
important reasons of State, have been graciously pleased to condescend to the
desires and humble petitions of Our loving Subjects in this behalf.

And therefore We do by these presents straightly charge and command, That no
person whatsoever, of what degree or quality soever, do at any time
hereafter, import, or cause to be imported from any part beyond the Seas, or
out of Our Kingdom of Scotland, into this Our Realm of England, or Dominion
of Wales, or into Our Realm of Ireland, any Tobacco, which is not of the
proper growth of the Plantations of Virginia, and the Summer Islands, or one of
them, upon pain of forfeiture unto Us of all such Tobacco so to be imported,
contrary to the true meaning of these presents, in whose hands soever the same
shall be found, and upon such further pains and penalties, as by the Laws and
Statutes of these Our Realms, or by the severity or censure of Our Court of
Star Chamber, in either of those Kingdoms respectively, may be inflicted
upon the Offenders, for contempt of this Our Royal command, and to be reputed
and taken as enemies to Our proceedings, and to those Plantations which so much
concern Our Honor, and the honor and profit of these Our Kingdoms. And We
further will and command, upon the penalties aforesaid, that from henceforth,
no person or persons whatsoever, presume to sow, set, or plant, or cause, or
permit, or suffer to be sowed, set, or planted, in any of his or their grounds,
any Tobacco whatsoever, within these Our Realms of England, or Ireland, or
Dominion of Wales, or any Isles or places belonging thereto, or permit or
suffer any old stock, plant, or root of Tobacco formerly set, sowed, or
planted there to continue, not plucked up and utterly destroyed, contrary to
the tenor and true meaning of a former Proclamation, made and published by Us
to that purpose, bearing date the thirtieth day of December, in the seventeenth
year of Our Reign of England.

And We further straightly charge and command, upon the pains and penalties
aforesaid, That no person whatsoever, presume to buy, or sell any Tobacco,
which from henceforth shall be imported, or brought from any the parts beyond
the Seas, or from Our Realm of Scotland, which is not, or shall not be of the
proper growth of the Colonies aforesaid, of Virginia, and the Summer Islands,
or one of them. And because We understand, that some, who intend their own
private, more then the public, conceiving it to be probable, that We would
grant the petition of Our Commons in Parliament, to prevent the effect thereof,
have lately imported secretly, and by stealth, great quantities of foreign
Tobacco, for which they have paid no Subsidy or other duty unto Us; We
further will and command, under the pains and penalties aforesaid, that no
person whatsouer, from, and after the five and twentieth day of March, now next
ensuing, presume to sell, or offer, or put to sale within these Our Realms or
Dominion, any Tobacco, which has been formerly imported into this Realm,
which is not of the proper growth of the Colonies, or Plantations aforesaid, or
one of them, nor that any person whatsouer, willingly and knowingly, take, or
use any Tobacco, from, and after the first day of May, now next ensuing, which
is not, or shall not be of the proper growth of the said Colonies, or
Plantations, or one of them. Yet, because the said foreign Tobacco may not
lie on the hands of the owners thereof, We are graciously pleased, that at any
time, within forty days after the said five and twentieth day of March, such
foreign Tobacco may be freely exported by any person whatsoever, without
paying any Subsidy or other duty for the same. And because no man shall
pretend ignorance, and thereby endeavor to excuse his offense in any of the
premises; We do further charge and command, and do hereby signify and
declare Our will and pleasure to be, that all, and every person and persons,
Merchant or other, who uses to sell, or has any purpose to sell Tobacco, who
have in his, or their hands, custody or possession, or in the hands, custody
or possesson of any other by their delivery, or to their use, any Tobacco
heretofore imported into this Our Realm, or planted, set, or sown within this
Realm, shall before the twentieth day of October, now next coming, bring the
same into Our Custom House, within Our City of London, if such Tobacco be
within five miles of Our said City, or if such Tobacco be in any other City,
Town, or place, within this Our Realm of England, or Dominion of Wales, or
Realm of Ireland, shall bring the same to the Towne-house, or other fit place,
which shall be to that purpose appointed by Us, in that City or Corporate
Town, nearest unto which the said Tobacco shall be, and shall before the first
day of December, now next coming, there require and cause the same to be
Marked and Sealed by such person or persons, and with such Seal and Mark, as
We shall thereunto assign or appoint for that purpose, without giving any fee
or allowance for the said Seal or Mark, and whatsoever Tobacco shall not be
Sealed or marked, as aforesaid, within the several times aforesaid, shall be
confiscate and forfeited unto Us for such their default and contempt. And for
the avoiding of all deceit and abuse in disguising of foreign Tobacco, or
mingling the same with the Tobacco of Virginia, or the Summer Islands, thereby
to defraud the true intent of these presents, We further straightly charge and
command, under the pains and penalties aforesaid, That no person, who is, or
shall be a seller of Tobacco, shall have, or keep ready cut, above the
quantity of one pound of Tobacco at once, nor shall mingle any foreign
Tobacco, with any Tobacco of the growth of the Summer Islands or Virginia.

And We straightly charge and command, that all the planters of Tobacco in the
Colonies aforesaid, or any part thereof, shall make the same good, and
merchantable, and shall not presume to send over into this our Realm of
England, any Tobacco, which shall not be good and merchantable, and well made
up in roll without stalks, or other bad or corrupt stuff, upon pain of
confiscation thereof, or so much thereof, as upon due trial made, shall be
found to be otherwise, to the intent that such of Our Subjects, as shall
desire to use the same, may not be abused, or deceived therewith, to the
impairing of their health. And to the intent that the Tobacco of the Colonies,
and Plantations aforesaid, thus tolerated by Us, may be known and
distinguished, from such as shall be secretly, and without warrant brought in
by stealth; We do likewise straightly charge and command, upon the pains and
penalties aforesaid, That all such Tobacco, as shall be brought from the
Colonies aforesaid, shall be all brought, and landed at the Key of Our Custom
house, in Our city of London, and not elsewhere, in any of Our Realms or
Dominions, and shall be there registered, and shall not be removed from Our said
Custom house, until it shall be there first tried, sealed, and marked, by
such person, or persons, and with such seal or mark, as We shall thereunto
assign and appoint; such seal or mark to be set thereto, without Fee, or
other reward whatsoever. And We do further straightly charge and command, upon
the pains and penalties aforesaid, That all owners of ships, be careful to
employ such masters in their ships, or other vessels, from whom they will take
good caution, not to offend in the importation of any Tobacco, contrary to this
Our Royal pleasure. And We do further signify and declare by these presents,
that We will require an exact account of the master of every ship, or other
vessel, that he shall make such diligent, and careful search, over the
mariners and passengers in his ship, or other vessel, that none of them shall
conueigh over into these Our Realms of England, or Ireland, or dominion of
Walls, or into any Port, Haven, Creek, or other parts thereof, any Tobacco,
to be imported, contrary to the true intent and meaning of these presents: And
that Our Customers, or their deputies, in every Port of these Our Realms of
England, and Ireland, shall, upon oath, examine every Master of a ship, or
other vessel, or other Officers and Mariners in the said ship, or vessel,
whether they have made search in the said ship or vessel, for Tobacco, and
whether any Tobacco be in the said ship, or vessel, to their knowledge, and
whether any Tobacco were laden in the said ship or vessel, and be taken out
thereof, and what is become of the same: And if any Master of a ship, or other
vessel, shall wilfully, or negligently permit, or suffer any Tobacco to be
imported, or shall otherwise offend, contrary to these presents, every such
Master (because it is in his power to prevent the same) shall also be
answerable unto Us for his contempt herein, and shall be subject, and liable to
all the pains and penalties aforesaid, as well as if he himself had actually
and purposely committed the said offense. And whereas We are informed, that
some traders in Tobacco, do use to import Tobacco in foreign Bottomes; We
strictly charge and command, that no person whatsoever, either Stranger,
Denizen, or natural borne Subject, presume to import any Tobacco whatsoever,
in any foreign bottom, at any time hereafter, upon pain of confiscation,
not only of the said Tobacco, but also of the ship, or vessel, wherein the
same is so imported, and upon the other pains and penalties aforesaid.

And for the better execution of Our pleasure herein, We do hereby command all
and singular Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Wayters, and other Officers,
attending in all, and every the Ports, Creekes, or places of lading or
vnlading, for the taking, collecting, or receiving of any of our Customs,
Subsidies, or Duties, to take notice of this Our pleasure: And We do hereby
command, and give power and authority unto them, and every of them, from time
to time, as well to search any ship, or other vessel, or bottom, ryding, or
lying within any Port, Haven, or Creek, within their several charge of
attendance, for all Tobacco imported, contrary to the intent of this Our Royal
Proclamation; and the same being found, to seize and take to Our use, and also
to take notice of the names, and apprehend the bringers in and buyers of the
same, to the end they may receive condign punishment for their offenses, upon
pain, that every of the said Officers, which shall be found negligent,
remiss or corrupt therein, shall lose his place and entertainment, and
undergo such pains and penalties, as by Our Laws, or by the censure of Our
said Court of Star Chamber, may be inflicted upon them for the same.

And We do likewise, will, ordain, and appoint, that it shall and may be
lawful, for such person or persons, as shall be thereunto authorized and
appointed, by him, or themselves, or his, or their Deputy or Deputies, with a
lawful Officer to search any ship, or other vessel, and to enter into any
shop, house, seller, warehouse, or other suspected places, at lawful and
convenient times, and there to search, discover, and find out any Tobacco,
imported, uttered, sold, or vented, or to be uttered, sold, or vented, not
marked or sealed, as aforesaid, contrary to the true meaning hereof, and all
such Tobacco so found, to seize, take away, and dispose of, and the owners
thereof, or in whose custody the same shall be found, to inform and complain
of, to the end they may receive punishment, according to Our pleasure before
herein declared.

And further, We do by these presents, will and require all and singular
Mayors, Sheriffs, Justices of Peace, Bayliffes, Constables, Headboroughs,
Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Wayters, and all other Our Officers and
ministers whatsoever, That they, and every of them, in their several places
and Offices, be diligent and attendant in the execution of this Our
Proclamation, and also ayding and assisting unto such person and persons, and
his and their Deputies and Assigns, as We shall so, as aforesaid, authorize
and appoint, as well in any search for discovery of any act, or acts to be
performed contrary to the intent of these presents, as otherwise, in the doing
or executing of any matter or thing, for the accomplishment of this Our Royal
command. And further Our will and pleasure is, and We do hereby charge and
command Our Attorney general, for the time being, to inform against such
persons in Our Court of Star Chamber, from time to time, whose contempt and
disobedience against this Our Royal command, shall merit the censure of that
Court, and to prosecute every such information speedily and effectually, until
the same shall be brought to sentence. And Our pleasure and command is, that
all the Tobacco which upon any seizure shall become forfeited, shall be
brought to Our Custom house, next adjoining to the Port, or place where the
same shall be seized, where the seizor thereof shall deliver the same to Our
use, and the same shall be forthwith burnt, consumed, and destroyed; but the
offendour, before he be discharged, shall pay to the party, who seized the
said Tobacco, the one half of the true value thereof: And that such person or
persons, whom We shall appoint, specially by Our Privy Seal, to take care
and charge of the execution of Our pleasure in the premises, shall have the
one half of all the Fines, to be imposed upon every offendour against this
Our Proclamation, for their encouragement to be diligent and faithful, in,
and about the performance of that service, We shall so commit unto them.

Given at Our Honor of Hampton Court, the nine and twentieth day of September,
in the two and twentieth year of Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland,
and of Scotland the eight and fiftieth. God save the King.

Excellent Majesty. 1624.
