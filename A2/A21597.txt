A Proclamation for keeping of the peace in London.
THe Queens Majesty commands all manner her Subjects of what degree soever
they be to keep the peace as they be bound, and specially toward all manner
of persons of strange Nations within her Majesty's City of London, or
elsewhere, without reproaches of words, or like quarrels, and to remit the
avenge of all quarrels past of late in the same City to the ordinary
Iusticers. And the like also her Majesty commands to all Strangers borne to
be observed on their part: And for the satisfaction of all sorts, both English
and Strangers, her Majesty most straightly commands her Mayor of London, and
all other Iusticers, as they will answer at their perils duly to see with
indifferency, and without any partiality, the first occasioners next hereafter
of quarrels and frayes, to be severely punished to the example of others, like
as it is presently ordered by her Majesty, that the whole circumstance of
certain frayes in London, betwixt her Subjects and certain Strangers shall be
duly examined and tried, and according to the Laws of the Realm, judged and
determined. For this is her Highness determination, that no partial favor be
showed to English or Stranger, but that every of them shall live in the safety
and protection of her Laws.

Yeuen at her Majesty's Honor of Hampton Court the xiii. of August, the first
year of her Highness Reign. God save the Queen.
