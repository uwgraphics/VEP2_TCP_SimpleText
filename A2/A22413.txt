By the King.
A Proclamation touching Mariners.
WHereas, by the Laws of this Realm, every Mariner receiving Presse-money to
serve the King in any of his Ships, and after refusing to serve, or absenting
himself at the time and place appointed unto him for his service, does incur
the danger and penalty of felony and is to be punished, and to forfeit as a
felon: And whereas his Majesty, out of his royal bounty, has lately
increased the wages and entertainment of Mariners to be employed in his
service, from fourteen shillings to twetny shillings the month, by a Medium,
which he will constantly continue for their encouragement, which is as much as
ordinarily they receive in Merchants wages, besides the large allowance of
victuals, which they have in his Majesty's Ships and service, and their daily
hopes of other profits and advantages, and their safety from being taken
Prisoners, which in Merchants Ships in these times of Hostility, they are
daily subject unto: Nevertheless his Majesty does find, that many of the
Mariners pressed for his service, and having received press and conduct money,
do daily run away, and absent themselves from his service, whereby his
Ships are unfurnished, and his service disappointed, to his Majesty's
dishonor, and the dishonor and danger of the State, in these times of peril,
when the foreign enemyis ready prepared to invade and infest his Majesty's
Realms and Dominions. His Majesty therefore in his Princely wisdom and
providence, foreseeing the extreme peril which may ensue, by the wilful and
base neglect of people of this quality, Has thought fit, by the advice of his
Counsel of war, to admonish all persons whom it may concern, That they be
careful at their uttermost perils, that they offend not in any such sort or
kind hereafter; And does hereby straightly charge and command all persons, who
shall hereafter be pressed for his service, as Mariners, or otherwise in any
of his Ships or other vessels, and shall receive press money to that purpose,
that they duly repair and come to the places, and at the times appointed unto
them, and there continue in the service unto which they are severally and
respectively assigned, upon pain of death, and all other such pains,
penalties, and forfeitures, as by the Law can be inflicted or imposed upon
them. And his Majesty does hereby straightly charge and command all his Judges,
Justices, Mayors, Sheriffs, and all other his officers and Ministers of
Justice whatsoever in their several places, and all Captains, Masters, and
other officers of, or in any of his Ships, or other Ships or vessels in
his Majesty's pay, That they carefully and diligently observe and execute his
Majesty's Laws and royal pleasure hereby signified and declared, upon pain
of his Majesty's high displeasure, and such other punishments, as by the Laws
of this Realm, or by hiS Majesty's Prerogative Royal can be inflicted upon
them.

Given at his Majesty's Court at White Hall, the eighteenth day of June, in the
second year of his Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God save the
King.
