HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE DIEV ET MON DROIT By the King.
WHereas there has fallen out an interruption of Amity, between the Kings
Majesty, and the most Christian King, which the common Friends, and ancient
Allies of both the Crowns, have earnestly labored to repair, by propounding
and negotiating a reconcilement between them upon honorable considerations,
as well to their Kingdoms, as the general estate of Christendom: The Kings
Majesty thereupon considering how pleasing it is to Almighty God, and
necessary to the present constitution of public affairs, to have Concord and
good Intelligence with such as he his Neighbors, and are further so nearly
allied unto him, has renewed the ancient Amity betwixt the two Crowns, their
Realms, Countries, Cities Towns, Lands, Dominions, Territories, Signiories,
Castles, and Subjects by Land, Sea, and Fresh-waters: By which Peace it is
already provided, that all Hostility and War, as well by Sea as Land, shall
cease on either party, from the fourteenth day of April last, and that the said
Kings, and their Subjects, shall live together in Peace, and that it shall be
lawful for their said Subjects, freely, peaceably, and quietly to go, come,
remain, and to use and exercise their Trade and Commerce, and do all things
else whatsoever in each others Countries, as freely as it has been done in any
former time of Peace had between the said Realms, and according to the
ancient Treaties and Alliances between them, with opening of safe and free
Trade betwixt the Kings Dominions, according to those Treaties.

And it is further ordained by the said Peace, in regard there are many Ships
at sea with Letters of Marque, which cannot so soon take knowledge of this
Peace, nor receive direction to forbear Hostility, that as whatsoever has
been, or shall be done, during the space of two months after the said
fourteenth of April last, shall not derogate from, nor hinder the said Peace of
the two Crowns; so whatsoever has been, or shall be taken within the
aforesaid time, shall be restored, as well on the one side as on the other. All
which premises, His Majesty has thought meet to notify to all manner of His
Subjects, of what estate soever the same be, strictly chargeing, and
commanding them to observe, perform, and accomplish all that hereunto
belongs, as it is certainly promised to be published on the French Kings
side, the date of these presents being the tenth of May, 1629.

God save the King
