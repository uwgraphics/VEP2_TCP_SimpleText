The prologue of a doctor in reco^mendation of Arystotle the prince of
philosophers.
GOd almighty save our king / and the glory of all his friends / and co^ferme
his realm in the faith of god. And cause him to reygne in thexaltacyon /
praise / and honor of his people. I which am servant to the king have put
in execution the work of his commandment / in getynge a book of good manners
to his governance. The which book is called the secret of secrets / made by
the prince of phylosophres Arystotle the sone of Mahonnet of Macedony / to his
dysciple ye emperor Alexander sone of Phylyp king of Macedony the which
Alexandre had two crowns. This said book Arystotle co^pyled in the oldenesse
of his body / because, that he might no more travail nor ride to do such
besynesses as Alexander had put into his charge. For Alexa^dre had made him
governor and master above all other because he was a man of very good
council / of great clergy / and subtle understanding. And incessantly studied
good and gracyous manners / and scyences spyrytuall / contemplatiues / and
charytables. He was a wise man / and meke / loving reason and Justice / and
ever reported right wysnesse and truth. And therefore many phylosophres r^pute
hy^ of the nombre of prophets. And say yt they had found diverse books of the
greeks which god had sent him by his most excellent angel / saying to him. I
shall make ye to be called in ye world more an angel than a man. And wit ye
yt Arystotle did in his life many signs which were strange in works and
meruayles / which were to long to be accounted. Before his death he did many
strange werkes^ wherefore a relygyon and company peryadyc said and held
opynion that he had been in heaven in likeness of a douue of fire And as long
as he lived Alexander overcame all y^ world through his counsel. And all
lands by the fame of him / were put under the imperyall commandment and in
likewise they of Perce / and Araby. and there was none yt durst gaynsay
Alexander / in word nor deed. And y^ said arystotle made many goodly epystles
for ye love yt he had to Alexander / and for to cause him to know all y^
secretes^ he made an epistle here under written / y^ which he sent to Alexander.
And wha^ Alexander had overcome y^ realm of Perce / and set y^ most of them
in his pryso^s / he sent an epistle to Arystotle which follows.

b. An epistle yt alexander sent to Arystotle.
Doctor of Justice and right noble philosopher we sygnyfy to thy high wisdom
/ y^ we have sent in y^ realm of Perce many me^ / which habou^de greatly in
reason / and understanding / subtyl and pen^tra^yfe^ wherefore al we have
intencyo^ to put the^ to death. Howbert as thou semest best sygnyfy us by thy
lettres.

c. An epistle y^ Arystotle sent to Alexander.
IF thou can moeue and change the air from y^ erth^ and water / and ye
ordinance of thy cytees to ^co^plysshe thy pleasure^ if thou can do it ceas of
/ and do it not / but govern the^ in thy goodness / and exal^ the^ in
benygnyte. And if thou do thus I hope with the grace of god that they all shall
be thy friends to all thy good pleasures and commandments. And for the love
that they shall have in the / thou shall peasybly reygne over the^ in great
vyctory. And when Alexander had red this epistle / he did after his counsel /
and they of Perce were more obedyent to him than to any other nacyon.

The prologue of a doctor named Phyly^ that translated this book in to latin.
d.
PHyly^ that translated this book in ^o latin was a child of Paris / and was a
very wise interp^tour and understander of languages / and he said ^hus. I have
not known nor seen ty^e that the philosophers have ho^^e^ / or have been
acustomed to help or to make all weckes or all secrets but that I have sought
/ nor have known by no man by whom I knew that he had knowlegyng of ye
scryptures of Philosophers / but I have vysited him unto y^ time y^ I came to
ye knowledge of council / yt which was Estulapideus / and a man solytary and
of great abstyne^ce^ and very wise in philosophy / to whom I meked me
dylygently / requyrynge him that he would show to me the scryptures of the
knowledge of the son / the which he gave unto me / with a right good wy^^ And
surely I found as much as I desired / and all that I had been about a hole
year / and wherefore I had long time trauayled. And I thus having my desire
returned home with great joy / yeldyng thanks to god my creator. And than at
the request of the most noble king with great study and labor I translated
this book out of Greek language into Caldees tongue and sith in to the speech
of Araby. The which book the most wyseman Arystotle made / which answered
always to all the requests of king Alexandre / as more plainly appears in
this present book.

b. An epistle sent to king Alexandre by Arystotle.
Right glorious sone and right wise / god co^serue the in the walk of
knowlegyng the ways of truth and virtues / and wtdrawe thy carnal and
beestly desires / and conferme his realm to his service / and to thy honor.
Letynge the wit dear sone yt I have received thyn epistle reverently and
honorably as it apperteyneth / and plainly have understand the great desire
that y^ have that I were personally with the. Meruaylyng how I can absteyne me
fro the. Reprouynge me of yt I care but little for thy besynesses. For y^ which
cause I have ordained and hasted me to make a book for the / the which shall
weye and conteyne all my works / supplyenge mine absence and defautes^ and
shall be to the a right certain rule and doctrine in all things y^ thou
wyllest. The which I will show as I were presently with the. Dear sone thou
ought not to repreue nor blame me / for thou know well yt for nothing of the
world / but that I would go to the. And if were not yt I am so sore grieved /
and lade^ with aege and weykenesse of my person / whereby in no wise I ca^ go
to the. And wit thou / that ye thing which thou have demanded of me / and
that thou so much desyrest to know and have is ye secrets that nature
humaynes thought scantly can compryse nor sustain. How tha^ may in the heart of
mortal man be written or understand that thing that he ought not to know.
And that thing that is not behouefull nor couenable to be spoken of. Howbeit I
am bound by very duty to answer to that / that thou demaundest. I shall
never other thing show the / but that which is written in this book. For if
thou read it dylygently / and understand it plainly / and that thou may
know yt is contained in it / without doubt thou shall have all that that thou
desyrest. For god shall give ye such grace / such understanding / and
subtylte of great wit and science / and also by the doctrine yt I have given
the before time / that by thy self thou may know and co^ceyue that which
thou desyrest. And ye cause why that I have opened and related my secrets
fyguratyuely and somewhat derkly / and that I have put observe examples / and by
fygures / is that I doubt and fear much that this book should come to the
hands of intect persons / and in the power of arrogant and evil folks /
which might know ye secrets of god. And god knows well that they be not
worthy. Certainly I make great doubt yt I in this trespace not ye will and y^
grace of god. I do relate and dyscouer this thing / as it has be^ reuelate of
god (or now) unto ye. wy^e thou then right dear sone that I have dyscouered to
ye the things that be^ to be hyd. And if thou dyscouer these secrets / thou
shall have shortly evil fortunes / and may not be sure from great harms
that shall be coming toward the. But almighty god keep the and me from such
things / and from all dyshonest things. And after all these things have in
thy mind this noble and prouffytable doctrine / ye I make ready to the / and
inte^de to expose thy noble heart / to inform it to thy great solace / as
myrour of health if thou wylt apply y^ ther^^ Most dear sone it behooves every
king ^o have ow^ things to sustain him and his royalme. But he may not
stedfastely have it / but if he have good and great governance of the^ that
ought to govern. And he yt reygneth so is obeyed of his subgectes. And his
subgectes egally with one courage / and by one self form shall be obedye^t to ye
lord. For by y^ dysobedyence of ye subgectes y^ power of ye lord is greatly
^eblysshed. And if y^ subgectes reygne / ye governance may nothing do. And I
shall show the / ye cause wherefore ye subgectes be styred and couraged to obey
their lord. two things there is. The one is outward and ye other inward. It
is not lo^gelyth I declared to the y^ that is outward. That is to wit / when
ye lord spe^deth wisely his richesse among his subgectest / and y^ he in them
work lyberalyte / and yt he give to echone as they be worthy. And therwt ye
king behooves to have a wyle / whereof I shall make mencyon in ye chapter of
vices and helps. That is to wit that y^ king ought to enforce him to get ye
he^^es of his subgectes by good works. And this is y^ first degree and
fou^dacyon in doing of his deeds by.ii. things. One inward and y^ other
outward. The cause outward is y^ y^ king do and mayntene Justice / y^
possessions and rychesses of his subgectes / and y^ he be pyteous a merciful.
The cause inward is yt he honor great learned men / and yt he have the^ for
reco^me^ded. For god has reco^me^ded the^ their scye^ce. And I reco^me^de y^
this secret pr^^cypally with diverse other / which thou shall find in other
chapytres of this book / where thou shall find great wisdom and doctrine /
and y^ content of y^ fynal cause whereby thou shall find thy pry^cypall
purpose. ^^n it thou shalt learn ye sygnyfycacyons / of y^ words and
obscurytees of ye examples. Tha^ thou shall (...) and perfytely have that yt
thou desyrest. wherefore pray to god most wise and glorious king y^ he will
lyghten thy reason and understanding to the^de yt thou (...) know and
perceive ye secrets of this seye^ce. And (...) me thou may be mine heir and
successor / and y^ he wit grant y^ largeness of goods / to give
habou^dau^ce to y^ living of wise me^ and studye^res / with grace to know yt
which is dyfficyle / and without the same nothing can be done.

e. Of ye manner of kings as touching largess.
THere be.iiii. manner of kings. There is a king yt is lyberall to him self /
and lyberall to his subgectes. There is a king y^ is lyb^rall to him self and
having to his subgectes. The ytalyens say y^ it is no vice to a king y^ is
having to himself / and lyberal to his subgectes The I^oyes say yt ye king is
good y^ is hauy^g to himself / to his subgectes. The Percye^s say ye contrary
and be^ / of (...) yt ye king is not worthy yt is not large to himself and
hauy^g to his subgectes. But among all y^ kings above said he is the worst /
and ought in no thing to be praised yt is not lyberall to him self and to his
subgectis. For he yt is having to him self and to his subgectis / his realm
shall be clean destroyed. Tha^ it behooves us to enquere of ye virtues and
vices above said / and to show what thy^g largess is and where in the error of
largess lies / and what harms come for lack of largess. It is euydent that
the qualytees be^ to be reproved wha^ they go fro y^ meaue / and be auarycyous
^ folysshe lyberall. But if thou will enquere or seek largess / regard and
consider thy power / and y^ time of the necessyte / and ye merytes of me^. And
than thou ought to give as thy power will (by measure) to them yt have need /
and be worthy of it. For he y^ gives otherwise he breketh ye rule of largess
and syn^eth And he that gives his goods to him that has no need / he gets
no thanks. And al yt he gives to the^ y^ be not worthy / is lost. And he y^
spends his good^ outragyously / shall soon come to y^ wild brymmes of
pouerte / and is like him y^ gives victory to his enemies over him. But a
king yt gives his goods mesurably to the^ yt have need / is lyberall to him
self and his subgectes And his realm shall come to great prosperyte / and his
commandment shall be fulfilled. And he y^ spe^deth y^ good of his realm without
order / and gives to the^ y^ be not worthy / and to the^ y^ have no need /
such a king destroys his people / and y^ common welthe / and is not worthy to
reygne as a king. And ye name of auaryce is an over foul name to a king / and
to much harm comes to his regal mageste. Therefore if a king will reygne
honorably / him behooves not to have y^ one nor the other of these vices / y^
is to wit / that he be not to lyberall / nor to coueytous. And if ye king will
be cou^ceyled / he ought with great dylyge^ce to pouruey him of a wise man /
which shall be chose^ among all other / to whom he shall commit his doings
of y^ realm / and the governance of the rychesses of the same as they ought
to be spent.

f. Of largess and auaryce / and of many other vices.
King Alexander most dear sone I tell the certainly that if on^y make greter
expense tha^ his realm ^ a^susteyne / that he enclyneth to folysshe largess
and auaryce. Such a king without doubt shall be dyst^oyed. But if he inclyne to
lyberalyte / he shall have perpetual glory of his realm / if he draw him fro
taking ye goods and possessions of his subgectes. And wit thou dear sone
that I find written of a greece doctor named Hermogynes which says that the
gretest and sovereign goodness / bryghtnesse of understanding / and plente of
law / scye^ce and perfeceyo^ of a king is y^ it behooves to keep him fro
taking of the goods and possessions of his subgectes. It has been ye undoing
of many realms. For diverse kings have made greter and outragyous expenses
tha^ y^ stynt of their realms could extend / wherefore they took the goods
and lands of their subgectes. For y^ which iniuryes doing ye people cried to
god / which sent vengeance on the said kings. In such wyce that their
people rebelled against them and put the^ to destrucey^. And without the great
mercy of god that sustained the^ / y^ realms should have be^ utterly dystroyed
with ye people. Thou the^ ought to absteyne ye from outragyous expe^ces / and
ought to keep te^perasice in lyberalyte. And get not the derke secretnesse and
reproaches that thou shall have / for ^^belon^eth not to the^ that be good.

g. Of virtues and vices / and of ye doctrine of Arystotle
THe substance of all vertuo^ reygnyng is to give to the^ yt be good / and
perdon iniuryes / honor and bear reverence to the^ yt be worthy / and have
mind of the^ yt he meke / and amend yt de fawtes of them yt be simple / and
with good will save ye people / and keep y^ fro to much spekyng / let imuryes
pass till thouse the time of defense yt thou know not ye folly of roles. Dear
soue I have taught ye and shall teache y^ many things ye which thou shall keep
in thy heart. And I ensure ye yt ye said rechynges shall always be there in all
thy doy^ges and weckes. Bright and suffycye^t science of physyke shortly
co^prysed thou shall have. And I would never have showed the on^y thing / but
yt y^ said science with yt techynges yt follow ought to suffyse the and thy
works in this world and in the other.

h. Of the understanding.
Dear sone know thou yt ye understanding is ye chyef of ye governance of man
/ and health of the soul / keeper of virtues / and of vices. For in ye said
understanding we behold the things yt be to be chosen. It is ye key of
virtues / and the rote of all laudable goods. And the best instrument thereof
is to have good fame. And if it be contraryly done / it shall be confounded at
the last by ill fame. A king ought pryncypally seek to have a good fame. More
for the gouerny^ge of his reame tha^ for him self.

i. Of ye fynall intencyo^ y^ a king ought to have.
FOr the beginning of largess that a king ought to have / is to have good
fame / whereby the great realms and great lordysshyppes be gote^. And if thou
desyrest to get realms or lordysshyppes / if it be not by good fame / thou
shall get none other thing but envy. And envy bredeth lesynges / which is
matter and rote of all vices. Envy bredeth ill speech / ill speech bredeth hate:
hate bredeth vniustyce / vniustyce bredeth battle / battle breketh all law /
dystroyeth cytees / and is contrary to nature. Than think dear sone and set
thy desire to get good fame / and thou shall have in the crouth and all things
laudable / for it is cause of al wealth. For it is contrary to lesynges / which
is matter of all vices / as it is said. And troth engenders the desire of
Justice. Justice engenders good says. Good faith enge^dreth famylyaryte.
Famylyaryte enge^dreth frendshyp. Frendshyp engenders council and help. And
for this cause all the world was ordained / and the laws made which be
conenable to reason and nature. It appears than that the desire to have good
fame is honorable and perdurable life.

k. Of euylles yt follow flesshely desire.
ALexander fair sone leave thy beestly desires of thy flesshly appetyte / for
they be corruptibles. The flesshely desires draws thy heart to beestly
corrupcyo^ of y^ soul without any dyscrcyon / and dries y^ body of man wotest
thou what flesshely love bredeth? It bredeth auaryce / auaryce bredeth desire /
desire bredeth richesse and makes a man without care / to be a proud man /
without law / and a thief. Theft brings a man to shame / and fynall
destruccyon of his body.

l. Of the wisdom and ordinance of a king.
IT is behouefull and right that y^ good fame of a king / be in honorable
science and worthynesse (thoroughout al realms) to be shed from his realm /
and have co^munycacyon of their wise council with his. And thereby he shall be
praised / honored / and doubted of his subgectes / when theyse y^ he speaks
and does his works wisely. For easily is perceived the wisdom or folly of a
king / for wha^ he governs him in worthynesse toward his subgectes / he is
worthy to reygne honorably. But he that puts his realm in seruytude or
thraldom / of evil customs / he breketh the way of veryte. And dyspyseth the
good way and law of god. And at y^ last be dyspraysed of all folks / as he
has deser^ed.

m Of the worthynes / relygyon / and holiness of a king.
ANd yet again well beloved sone I tell y^ that the phylosophres have spoken
and said. It behooves that ye royal mageste be governed by ryghtwysnesse / and
not by faint appearance / but in deed / to the end y^ every man may se and know
clearly the goodness of the king / and that he fear god. And will be
governed in godly ways / than shall he be honored and doubted. And if he
show him self faynynge to be good / and is naught to his subgectes / his ill
works can not be hyd / nor it may not be but his people shall know it He
shall be despised of god and shamed in the world. And his deeds shall be lessed
/ and the honor of the crown of his realm shall fail. what shall I tell ye
more? there is no treasure in this world to good fame. And moreover dear ^one /
it besemeth y^ thou worship clerks / and pouerte of good men of relygyon / and
exalt wise me^ and speak often with the^. And questyon often of doubts with
them. And demand many things of them. And answer wisely their questyo^s. And
honor noble men as each of them is worthy.

n. Of the pourueyaunce of a king.
IT behooves that a wise king think often of things to come that he may
provide for such things as be contrary to him. And y^ he may the easiyer bear
the aduersytees and contrary adue^tures. And the king ought to be wisely hyd
and refreyned / to the end that without delyberacyon he come not to the deed
that he purposed in his anger. And he ought reasonably knowledge his anger and
error / and appease him self easily. For the most sovereign wisdom and
virtue that a king may have / is to rule him self wisely. And when he sees
any thing that is good and prouffytable for him to be done / he should do it
with great dylyge^ce / and dyseceeyo^ because y^ people shall not say y^ he has
done his business folysshely / or to neglyge^tly.

o. Of the vestymentes of a king.
IT besemeth well to y^ mageste royal that y^ king be clothed honorably. And
that he show himself always in fair and ryall clothes. And ought in beauty of
robbes to surmount all other clothing. Also he ought w^ great prerogatyf and
dygnyte use fair / dear / and strange vestures. For thereby is his dygnyte
more excellent and his might more exalted. And more reverence is made to him.
And also it besemeth a king to be fair spoken / with soft and kind words /
specially in time of war.

p. Of the countenance of a king.
Sweet sone Alexander it is a goodly thing precious / and honorable wha^ y^
king speaks but little. But if over great need require it. It is better y^ ye
eeres of y^ people be wyllyng to here y^ words of a king / tha^ to be weary of
his to much spekyng. For wha^ y^ eeres be glutted with the kings speech their
hertes be weary to se him. And also y^ king ought not to she we himself to
often to his people / nor haunt to much y^ company of his subgectes / and
special of vylayns. And therefore the yndyens have a good custom in y^
ordinance of their realm. For their manner is that their king shows
himself but ones in the year. And tha^ he is clothed in vesture royal. And
all y^ barons and knights of his realm be^ rychely armed and arrayed about
him. And he is set upon a stede^ ceptr^ in his hand armed with rich armures
royalles and all his people a good way before y^ barons and other noble me^.
And there they show y^ diverse perils and adue^tures y^ be passed. And how y^
he and his cou^celles w^^ ordered. And y^ king as tha^ is wo^te to pardon gre^^
offenses to some of the^. And wha^ y^ parlyame^t is e^ded y^ king sets him
in a chair and anoue ^yseth one of ye most wysest me^ and speaks to y^
people / praysyng and co^me^dyng y^ wit and good governance of y^ king. In
yeldynge thanks to god y^ has so well ruled and mayntened ye yndye^s king /
and y^ they are pourueyed of so wise and honorable a king to reygne and guide
the^ And tha^ he co^fermeth y^ said people in one will and courage to y^
obedience of y^ king. And the^ he commends y^ people and aloweth the^ greatly
of their good manners and co^dicyons which be reports to the^. And shows
the^ goodly words and examples / y^ better to put them in grace and obeysaunce
/ w^ meekness in the good will of the king. And when this wise prince has
thus spoken / the people enforce them to exalte the praysynges / and
commendacyons / and good manners of this said king / in prayenge god hertely
for him. And by this mean by their good manners / and wisdom of their king
they cause countrees and cytees to be obedyent to them. And thus ben the
children brought up in their youth / and taught in the honor and reverence of
the king. And the good fame of the king secretly and manyfestly is spredde and
known And the rich and poor ben thereby sustained thoroughout the realm of
ynde. And the kings possessions and trybures increases thereby.

q. Of the Justice of a king.
A king ought to order him so that he do no wrong / nor harm to merchants
/ but ought to cherysshe them. For they go thoroughout all the world / and by
them is reported the good and all renownes of fordes / and princes. And a king
ought by very Justice to yield every man his. And so his lands and cytees
shall be garnysshed with all welthes. And the kings works shall multyply to
his honor and glory / and shall be the more redoubted of his foes / and shall
live and reygne at his will and desire in quietness.

r Of the worldly desires of a king.
ALexander right worthy sone / coueyt not always wordly things / for they be
corruptyble. And think that thou must leave all. Demand than such things
as cannot be corrupt. That is the lyce that cannot change and the realm
perdurable. And reyse thy thoughts in goodness / and therein keep y^ ^stro^ge
and glorious. And leave the life of bestes y^ always live in their fylthynesse.
Believe not lightly al thing that is told to the. And be not enclyned to
pardon them / against whom thou have had vyctory. And think on the time and
of things that may happen. For thou know what is to come. And set not thy
desires in meats and drynkes / in ^echery / nor to much sleep / nor in
carnal desires.

r. Of the chastyte of a king.
Sovereign Emperor enclyne not to ^^^^ry of wom^ / for it is a swy^ysshe life.
And no glory shall be to the if thou govern the after ye living of bestes
without reason. Dear sone believe me / for without doubt it chery is destruccyon
of the body / the abregement ^ corrupcyon of all virtues / the death of a man
self and makes the man feminyne. And at the last brings him to all euylies.

s. Of the sporting of a king.
SOthly it is besemynge to a king to take his pastyme and sport with his
princes and lords. And that he have many and diverse manners of mynstrylles /
and syndry instruments / dau^ces and songs. For the humayne creature
naturally anoyeth. And in such instruments and pastymes nature desires / and
the body takes force and vygoure. Than if thou wylt delight in such chy^ges /
do it y^ most honestly and secretly that thou may. And wha^ thou art in thy
pastymes beware for drinking of wine. And let y^ other sport the^ as long as
they lust. And tha^ thou shalt have many secrets dysclosed. And make not this
pastyme often / but twyse or thryse in y^ year. Also it behooves y^ to have
nyghe to the some of thy famylyer servants that shall tell and report to y^
what is said in y^ realm. And wha^ thou art among thy barons and subgectes /
honor wise me^ and bear reverence to every ma as they be worthy. And every
man in his estate / mayntene and let the^ ete with y^ sometime / one after
another. And give gowns sometime to one and somty me to another / after their
estate / and as they be worthy. And in any wise se y^ there be none of thy
knights and famylyers / but y^ he feel of thy lyberalyte and of thy grace. And
thus ouerall shall appear thy largess and gretnesse of thy courage and honor.

Of the dyscrecyon of a king.
Most worthy sone it is good that a king have lyberalyte / goodly gesture /
and countenance and that he laughe not to much. For ouermoche laughyng
causes many to be less set by / and to be less honored. And fynably
ouermoch laughyng makes a person to seem older than he is. Also a king ought
to love his people in his court and of his council more than in other parties.
And if any do vylany to another / be ought to punysshe him as he has deserved
/ that other may take example thereby / and eschew the^ from ill doing. And in
y^ punysshynge thou ought to regard y^ person y^ has done amysse. For else
should a high and noble man be punysshed as another. And if thou do so thou
shall not be allowed of y^ people. And it is good sometime to do rygorous and
straye Justice / and sometime not / to the end not y^ dyfference of y^ persons
be known. For it is wryte^ in the book of Machabe^s that a king ought to be
praised ^ loved / if he be like y^ eygle / which has lorshyp over all fowls.
And not as he which will be like another foul y^ is subgecte to the eygle.
Wherefore if any do vylany to any other in the presence of y^ kings mageste
tought to be regarded and co^sydered if y^ offense were done in game or for to
cause the king to laugh / or to make him or other glad of it / or if he did it
in despyte / and shame of the mageste royal. For y^ first deed he ought to be
correct / and for the second to suffer death.

Of the reverence of a king.
WOrthy king Alexander dear sone the obedience to a king comes by iiij.
things. That is for y^ virtuous living of the king. Because he makes him to
be beloved of his subgectes. Because he is curteys. And for the honor and
reverence / that he does to them that be most worthy of it. My dear sone do
so much that thou may draw to the y^ courages of thy subgectes / and avenge
the^ of all wrongs and iniutyes done to the^. And beware that thou give not ^
thy subgectes cause and matter to speak against the For speech of people many
times may do hurt Tha^ have in thy mind such wise that nothing may be said
against the. And so thou shall eschew the ill will and deeds of the^ that had ill
will against the. And forsooth the largeness of the glory of thy dygnyte and
reverence / and exaltacyon or thy realm / and that rebou^deth most to thy
honor is to have the hertes of thy subgectes. It is found in holy scryptures
/ y^ the king is over a realm as the rain is over y^ earth which is the grace
of god and blyssynge of the heue^s and comes on the earth / and all living
creatures. For the rain is called the way of merchants / and help of
buylders. How be it that in the rain falls sometime thondre and lyght^ynge?
swellynge of the sea and floodes with te^pestes and many other euyls comes
thereby / wherewith meadows and verdures has perysshed. For god made it so of
his gre^e goodness / benygnyte / and grace. The which self example ye may
find in winter and somer. In the which the sovereign largess gives and
ordeyneth coldenesse and heat / engendrynge and encreasynge of all new
things. How be it many euyle and perils comes by the rygour of great
coldness of winter / and great heates of somer. Iulyke wise dear sone is it of
a king. For many times the king does many grefes and euylles to his subgectes
/ and makes the to bear great heart against him. But when the people sees
that by the grace and good governance of y^ king they be in peace and well
ruled they forgete the above said euylles / and thank the glorious god that
has pourueyed them of so wise a king.

How the king ought to remember his subgectes.
I Require y^ sweet sone that thou of thy goodness think and inquyre
ofte^tymes of thy poor subgectes / and know their necessytees. And set among
them such me^ as be virtuous and that loves god and Justice and that knows
their manners / and understands their speches / and can govern them peasybly
and in love. And if thou do thus / thou shall do the pleasure of thy creatoure.
And it shall be saufegarde to thy realm / and gladness of the and thy people.

t. Of the merry of a king.
Dear sone I council the that thou make great prouysyo^ of corn and vytayles
in such wise that thy countrees may have haboundaunce / in eschew^nge (as it
chances often) to have scarcyte^ and famyn. In so much that by the great
prudence thou may save and maynteyne thy subgectes And thou ought to have thy
garuers stuffed / and to preclayme thrughout all thy realm and cytees / how
thou have gadred and stored the of greynes and other vytayles And that thou
kepest the^ to the prouysyon of thy real me / and to utter them with plente to
the salvation of thy subgectes. The which doing will cause thy people to be
coragyous to do thy commandments. And so thou shall prospere / and every man
will marvel of thy great lyberalyte / and of y^ prouydence before hand in thy
besynesses. And they will repute the as holy and lawde and magnyfye thy
worthynesse. And every man will fear to dysplease the.

v Of pains and punysshementes.
MY dear sone Alexander / I admonysshe^ and also pray the to keep my doctrynes
and thou shall come to thy purpose. And thy realm shall be durable and in good
estate. That is to wit / above all thing that thou keep the from shedynge of
man's blood. For it belongs only to god / which knows the secrets of
men. Than take not on the / the office that belongs only to almighty god /
wherefore as much as thou may withdraw thy hand the^fro For the doctor
Hermogenes says. That who that sleeth the creature like unto him / all the
sterres of the sky cease not to cry to the mageste of god / lord / lord
thy servant will belyke unto the. For surely god will take vengeance on him
that sleeth a man / and specially without reasonable cause. For god answers
to the virtues of heaven saying. Leave ye / for in me lies the vengeance / and
I can yield it. And wy^e thou that the virtues of heaven without cease do
present before the face of god / the death and blood of him that is deed / till
that god has taken vengeance for it.

u. Of the knowledge of the said pains.
O Most loving sone / of all such pains with the knowledge / thereof wit
thou that I have seen much harm / and many euylles oftentimes come thereby. Do
^oo that thou may have in thy mind the deeds or works of poets. And think
how they have lived. And thereby thou may se and learn many goodly examples.
And their thoughts shall give the great docume^tes in time coming. And also
I pray the my dear sone / that thou grieve nor dysprays^ ^^ne lesser than thou.
For it happens often that the small estate ryseth tyght soon in to great
rychesses and honors / and may be so mighty that ^e (...) endomage the. Many
examples thereof has been seen as phylosophres rehearse.

x. How a king ought to keep his faith or oath.
Above all thing (dear sone) beware that that thou break not thy faith and
oath that thou have made. For it is belonging to strompettes / and also to
people that ^epe not / nor do not care for their faith and oath. wherefore
keep thy faith that thou have promised / for and if that thou do otherwise and
will come to an evil end at the last. And if by adventure or fortune / it
chances that any welthe com^th by faith brekynge / the trust thereof should
not be good / but very evil and reprouable / and such a man is put in the
nombres of them that be naught. wit thou than that by keeping of faith is
made y^ goodly assemblynge of men. Cytees ben inhabyted with comyns / and (...)
is the good sygnouryes of kings. By keeping of ^ayth castelles ben holden and
kept in lordshyps. And if thou break thy faith thou shall be reputed of every
man as a child or a brute be than beware thereof. And keep also the oaths /
and alyaunces that thou have made / though that they be grievous and domageable
to the. Wotest thou not y^ thou have two spyrytes always with the / one on the
^yght side and the other on the lift side / which know and keep all thy
works. And report to thy creatoure all that thou have done. Of a troth thou
ought only to a^steyne y^ from all dyshonest works. And constrey^e none to
swear / but if over great need require it. A king ought not to swear but he be
much required and prayed. And if thou wy^t wife what was the destruccyon of
Nubye / and of the assyrye^s. I certyfye the that their king made oaths
gylefully / to deceive the men and ^y eze^s next by. And brake his alyaunces
and ^romysses that he had made / because they were profitable to his realm.
And also to his subgectes he made many falls oaths to destroy their next
neighbors. The ryghtwyse Judge could sustain nor suffer them no longer. Most
dear sone I will that thou know / that for the gouernynge and ordinance of
thy realm I have made the some new doctrynes / the which specially is for the
profit of thyn own famylyers and the. But as yet it is not time to give the^
to the. I w^ll give the them in a certain place of this book shortly abreged.
The which if thou keep for thy self prouffytably / with the help of god thou
shall have prosperyte / and that that thou desyrest. Sweet sone repent y^ not
of things that be passed / for that belongs to wom^ / which ben weyke of
condycyon. Let thy goodness / thy faythfulnesse / and cons^yence be all hoo^e
/ and manifest. And they shall be saufegarde o^ thy realm and destruccyon of
thyn enemies.

y. Of study.
Take heed that thou have studyes and ^^^^les in thy cytees. And cause all ^hy
people to learn their children lettres and (...) scyences / and use them to
study. For (...) ought to help and socoure the gouern^^^ le of studyens and
poor scolers. And give advantages and prerogatyues to good studyentes that
p^e^fyte to their learning / and this wise thou shall gr^ue an example to the^
that be lay / exalte their prayers and receive their writing mekely / praise
them y^ ought to be worshypped. Give thy goods to them that be worthy.
Cherysshe clerks and styre them to praise the. And put the and thy works in
goodly wrytynges / which by them shall be perpetually praised.

z. How a king ought to keep his body.
Most beloved sone king Alexandre / trust ^ot in women / nor in their works
/ nor seruyces / and company not with them. And if necessyte were that thou
must have company of a woman. ^o so that thou may know that she is true to
the / and wholesome of her body. For when thy person is between the arms of a
woman / thou art as a Iew^^^ / put / and resting in the hands of a marchau^
^^^at cares not to whom it is ^olde. And being between her hands / is the
poison of thy welfare / and also the destruccyon of thy body. Beware therefore
dear sone / of such w^men / for they be venymous and deedly. For it is no new
thing to know that by their venym many me^ have dyed. Thou know well that
many kings have for^hered and shortened their lives and have dyed by poison.
Also dear sone Alexander beware that thou put not thy trust in one physycyen
only. For one physycyen may hurt the / and shor^ely do to the mothe harm
And therefore yt thou may / do so that thou have many physycye^s. And that
they be of one agreement. And if thou wylt have any medicine / take it not but by
the council of them all. And that they be such as knows the qualyte and
nature of the things that been put / and necessary in the medycyne.

And that it be of a certain weight and measure / as the medycyne requires
it. For by equal porcyo^s of weight and measure the art of physyke is
compownded. And think on dear sone that when thou was in the parties ofynde /
many people made to the great presents and fair. Among the which was s^nte
a fair maiden which in her chyldheed had be nourysshed with venym of
serpents / whereby her nature was converted in to the nature of serpents. And
than if I had not wisely beholden her and by my arts and wit known her /
because that co^tynually / and without shamefastness ever she looked in the
faces of the people / I perceived that with ones bytynge she would have put a
man to death as sythen thou have seen the experyence before ^he.

And if I had not known her nature / at the first time that thou had meddled
with the said m^yde thou had ben deed without remedy. Fair sone keep thy
noble soul / which is given to the and ^ent from the company of aungelles the
which is taken to the of god for to keep. Not that thou soil and ^arre it but
y^ it be put among the wise and gloryfyed spyry^^s.

and Of the dyfference of astronomy.
ALexander fair sone / I pray the / that if thou may^t do it / that thou ry^e
(...) nor eat / nor drink / nor do any other thing / but by the council of
some that knows and has the scy^^ce in knowlegy ^ge the sterres and
astronomye. And thou shalt wit my dear sone that almighty god has made
nothing without cause / but has done every thing reasonably. And by certain
scyences and ways / the wise phylozopher Platon sought and felt the
operacyons of all things composed of the four elements / and the humors
contraryes. And had also the knowledge of the things created and formed And
also my dear sone Alexander I pray the believe not such fools which say y^ y^
scye^ce of y^ pla^^^^^s is so hard to be known / and that none may come
thereto. Surely they be fools and wo^e not what they say. It is a noble thing
to know things which be to come. if thou know the things which be to
come / thou and other persons may put remedy by good prayers. And require the
creatoure that has ordained them to return their malice / and ordeyne them
otherwise. Think not dear sone that god has ordained and predestynate such
things / but that by his power he may change them otherwise when he pleases.
Wit thou dear sone y^ y^ good people pray to our creatoure with orysons and
devout petycyons / by fasting and sacrefyces / by alms and other manner /
axyng of pardon of their sins / and doing penance / y^ our lord may
return and remember such predestynacyons which other do fear so much.
Return we dear sone to our first purpose / wit thou y^ astronomye is deuy^ed
in.iiii. pertes. That is to wit in ordinance ofsterres. In y^ dysposycyon of
signs / and of their elongacyons. Of the moeuynge of the son^e. And this
party is called science of astronomy: The other part is of y^ knowledge of the
moeuynge of the skies and of the moon. And this party is called astronomy. And
is y^ worthyest / of sterres / planettes / and signs. And there is.M.xxviii.
planettes sygned / and formed / of y^ which we shall speak more plainly.

con. Of the gouernayle of health.
Health among all things is to be gote^ and has more than any might of
rychesses. For y^ keeping of health is by using of equal things comoyned to the
body / as by attemperaunce of humors. For the glorious god has ordained the^
/ and given diverse remedies to the attemperau^ce of the humors to the keeping
of health. And has showed it to his holy men and prophets / and to many other
Just men which he did choose and en^umyned with the holy ghost / in his
sapyence dyuyne / and mighty. And has given them the gifts of the science /
of these things here after following. These philosophers put the beginning of
it. That is to wit they of yude / of Greece / and of Athenes. which
phylosophres were Just and perfyte / and their wrytynges were the begy^nynge of
scye^ce and secrets. For in their w^y tynges is nothing found to be reproved
nor (...) / but approved of all wy^e men.

rum. Of the gouernayle of seek people.
ALl wise and natural phylosophres say y^ man is made and composed of four
contrary humors / the which have always need to be sustained with meat and
dry^ke The substance whereof beheueth to issue and be corrupt if any do always
ca^e and drink / and he should wax weyke and fall in great dyseases / and
have many inconuenyences. But if he eat and drink te^peratly and reasonably /
he shall find help of life / strength of body / and health of all the me^bres.
The wise phylosophres say that if any man ^respace the god of nature / and the
good manner of living be it in to much eating and drinking / or to much
slepynge / or waking / in to much walky^g or resting / being to laxatyfe or
to much let ynge of blood or to little / it can not be but he must fall in
many dyseases / and greues. Of the which dyseases I have bryefly found / and
therein will I show the my council / and remedy for the same. All wise
phylosophres accords in one saying. who so keeps him fro ouermoche eating
and drynkyng / and from y^ excesses aforesaid and keeps temperau^ce / he shall
be helthfull of his body / and live long. For I can find no man but he is of
this opinion / and will say y^ all delectable things of the world / be it in
pleasure of y^ body / it is but for to live y^ longer in them. But for a more
secret ye ought to enforce you to do such things as ben belonging to long
life / and not to follow the appetyte / y^ is to wit / not to put lie meat
upon meat. And dear sone I have herd often spoken of ypocras which kept many
times dyete to the^de y^ he might live and endure the longer. Not for to live
and endure for y^ meat and drink. Also dear sone it is great holsomnesse to
be purged of superfluytees and evil humors which ben in y^ body.

A. In how many manners a man may keep his health.
GOod sone I pray the have in thy mind steadfastly these certain instruceyo^s
and keep the^. Know thou that health is chyefly in two things. The first is
let a man use such meats and drynkes as he has be^ nourysshed with. The
second that he purge him of ill humors that be corrupt and grieve him. For ye
body of man is fed with meats and drynkes which nourysshe it by natural
heat that dries / nouryssheth and fedeth ye moystnesse thereof.

B. Of diverse meats for ye stomach.
WHa^ ye body is fat and full of vapors gross meats is good for it. and of
ye nourysshy^g of such a body / ye dygestyo^ is gross / and of greece qua^tyte
for ye great heat / and vapors of ye body. And wha^ the body is sklneder and
dry / subtle and moist meats be good for it. And ye dygestio^ thereof is of
small qua^tyte for ye streytnesses of ye co^duytes. And it is great wisdom and
science for a man to use such meats as ben good and appertene^t to his
co^plex yo^ / that is to wit if he feed him with hot meats te^peratly. But if
the hear be to grievous and bre^nynge wtin the body by over strong wynes and
hot meats / or other accydentes / tha^ contrary meats and drynkes will do
great ease and prouffyte yt is to wit such as ben cold. Of the stomach.

If thy stomach be to hot tha^ hot and course meats be good. For such a
stomach is like a mighty fire for to bre^ne great weight of logges. But wha^ ye
stomach is cold and feeble tha^ it is good to have light and subtyle meats.
The signs to knowledge ye stomach.

The signs of a stomach yt is of an ill and weyke dygestyo^ is wha^ ye body is
unlusty / heavy / and slouthful / ye face is swolle^ / and he yaneth often / and
has pain in his eye^ / and bolketh often and rudely / and ye bolkyng is lowre
and unsavory / watery and stynki^g / and thereby is bredde wyndes and swellynge
of the belly and ye appetyte of mea^^ is marde. Therefore sweet sone beware of
meats and drynkes yt may hurt or be contrary to thy health.

C. An epistle of great value.
Most dear sone Alexander sithe it is so that the body of man is corruptyble
by dyuersyte of co^plexyon / and of contrary humors that been in it / whereby
often there comes corrupcyo^ to it / I thought to deliver the some thing y^
shall be necessary and prouffytable to the. In the which I will treat of the
secrets of physyke which shall please the. For certain dyseases come to a
king which be not honest to show to physycyens. And if thou wylt observe
this lesson / thou shall have no need of physycyens / except in causes y^ may
come in battle / the which may be exchewed. Alexander fair sone / when thou
rysest from thy sleep / walk and stretche thy members egally and comb thy
heed / for stretchyng of the lymmes gives force / and combynge reyseth the
vapoures that been come in slepynge and puts them from the stomach In somer
wasshe thy heed in cold water / which shall yield the natural heat / and
shall because of appetyte to meat. Than clothe the with goodly and rich
apparel. For the heart of man delyteth in the beholding of precious meats and
clothy^g. Than rub thy tethe with some course lynnyn / or other thing that is
note and dry of co^plexcyon / and sweet of smell for it is holsom for the
tethe / and keeps them clean / cleanses the stenche of the mouth / and clereth
the voice / and gives appetyte to ear. And rub thy heed often in the same
wise for it opens the claustres of the brain / and thycketh the neck and
other members / and cleanses the face and the sight / and prolongeth stowpynge
of aege / and amendeth the blood.

Also anoint the sometime with sweet smelling oyntementes / as the time
requires / for in such sweetness thy heart takes great pleasure / and is
nourysshed thereby. And ye spyryt of life takes refeccyon in good odoures: and
the blood reneth meryly through y^ veins of the body. After that take sometime
an electuary of a wood called Aloes / and of Bubarbe which is a precious
thing / to the price of four pens. Which thou shalt find written in the book
of physyke / and this shall do the much good / for it voydeth the heat of the
mouth of the stomach / and warmeth the body and wastes wyndes / and makes
good taste and sauoure. After this I counsel y^ that thou be often with thy
noble and wise men of thy realm / and speak to the of thy besynesses that thou
have to do. And govern them sadly according to their good customs.

D. Of the manner to travail.
OR ever thou eat or thyn appetyte comes at thyn hour accustomed do some
travail / that is to wit walk or tide a little / or do some other work /
for it helps y^ body much / it voydeth all ventosytees / and makes the body
lyghter stronger and lustyeth the stomach / and wasted evil humors of the
body and makes the flewme or the stomach descend. Of the manner of eating.

Fair sone wha^ thy meat is set before the / eat of such as thou desyrest
most / resonably / with well leuayned breed. And eat of such as ought to be
first eaten. For there be two manners of dygestyo^ of meat in a man that is to
wit / soft / and hard. For in the boto^ is most heat for to make meat /
because it is most flesshly / and nyghest the heat of the liver wherewith the
meat is soden and dygested.

E. Of abstynence of meat.
WHa^ thou eatest / eat by leisure / though thou have great appetyte to eat.
For if thou eat gredely noughty humors do multyply / the stomach is laden
the body is grieved / the heart is hurt / and the meat remains in the
stomakes botome vndygested.

F. How pure water ought not to be dronke^.
ALso beware dear sone that ye drink no pure water / specially when thou haste
eaten meat. But if thou be wont thereto. For as soon as the water is upon the
meat / it coleth y^ stomach / and quenches the heat of the dygest you and
comfort of the meat. It lets dygestyon and greueth the body. If thou must
need drink water alone / take it the most temperatly and as little as thou
may.

G. Of the manner to sleep.
When thou have taken thy refeccyon and have just to sleep / lie down on a
soft bed and sleep temperatly. And first lie down on the lift side / and
sleep thereon a reasonable space / for the lift side is cold and has need to
be warmeth. And if thou feel any pain in thy belly or in thy stomach / tha^ lay
thereto a sovereign medytyne / that is a warm lynnen cloth laid thereon. Wit
you dear sone that travail is good / and gives heat to the stomach. But after
dinner it is a noughty thing / for the meat abides vndygested in the botome of
the stomach / and thereof be bredde many dyseases. And sleep before fedynge is
not good / for it makes the body leave and dries the humors. But slepynge
after fedynge is good / for it fulfylleth y^ body and gives force / and ^no^^
if shyng thereto. For wha^ y^ body of man rests / tha^ y^ natural heat draws
y^ heat yt was spredde in all y^ me^bres in to y^ boto^ of y^ stomach / and
gives strength thereto upon y^ refeccyo^ of y^ meat. And heat requires rest.
Therefore some phylosophres have said y^ it is better and holsomer to eat at
night than in the morning / for the eating in y^ morning because of y^ heat of
y^ day greueth y^ stomach / and y^ body is more trauayled therwt. And moreover
y^ person chauffeth i^ trauaylyng doing his business / in going and speky^g
/ and many other things y^ belongs to y^ body of man / by y^ which heat y^
is outward toward none / ye natural heat y^ is in ward is weyked and
appeyred / and y^ meat is hard to dygest. But at night it is more easy and
less grieved with y^ heat of traueyle. And y^ heart and me^bres of man be^ more in
quiet by y^ coldness of ye night / that gives natural heat to the stomach.

H. The keeping of custom or wont.
THou shall understand my dear sone that he that is wont to eat but one
meal often is dyseased / for y^ stomach is without dygestyo^ and ye body has
(...) nourysshy^g. And he y^ is acustomed to eat at one time o^^s another time
twyse he shallyghtly perceive that it does him harm / for custom charge
nature.

I. How one ought to change custom
ANd if need constreyne the to change thy custom / do it wisely / that is to
wit by little and little. And so by the grace of god thy chaungynge shall be
good. But above al things beware that thou eat not till thou rele thy stomach
empty and that it has made good dygest yon of the first meal. And this thou
may know by y^ desire that thou shall have to thy meat: and by thy spa^^e
that tornyth subtylly in thy mouth. And if thou eat without need or appetyte
the heat of thy stomach shall be made cold as yse. And if necessyte be y^
thou must eat / and have an appetyte thereto y^ kind heat of thy stomach will
be as hot as fire / and of good dygest yo^. And beware y^ wha^ thy appetyte
comes that thou eat not forth with / for it will gadre ill humors of thy body
in to thy stomach / which will hurt thy brain. And if thou tarry over long
or thou eat / it will feeble thy stomach / and the meat will do thy body no
good. And if so be y^ thou may not eat as soon as thy appetyte requires /
and y^ thy stomach be full of ill humors / do so y^ thou may vomyte or thou
^a^e / and after y^ vomyte take an ^lectuary / and eat surely.

K. Of the four seasons of the year.
OUr intencyon is to treat in this book of y^ four seasons of the year / with
the qualyte / propryete / contraryte / and dyfference of each of them. And they
ben certain seasons of the year divided as follows. That is to wit prymtyme
or vere begins when the son eurreth in the sign or Arts / and lasts
four score and xiij. days / and.xviij. hours / and the fourth part of an
hour. That is to wit from y^.x. day in y^ end of March / to y^ four and
twenty day of June. And in this season the days and nyghtes beneg all of
length The wether is fair. The warm wether comes. The snowes melte / ryuers
run swyft and clear / and wax warm / the moystnesse of the earth ryseth to
y^ heyght of trees / and causes them to smell sweet. Meadows and graynes
sprowte and corn grows / and all flowers take color / birds b^n clothed
with new robes / and enforce them to sing. Trees ben decked with leaves and
flowers / and the lands with seeds. Beestes engendre and all people take
strength and lust. The earth is arrayed goodly / and is as a fair bryde clothed
with Iewelles of diverse colors because she should seem the fayrer at her
wedding.

L. Of prymtyme / and what it is.
THe prymtyme is hot and moist temperatly as the air. This season y^ blood
moeueth and spredeth to all the members of the body / and the body is parfyte
in temperate complexyon. In this season chekyns / kyddes / and peched ^gges
ought to he eaten / with letuses and gotes milk in these three months.
Prymetyme begins when the son enters the sign of Aryes and lasts.xci^.
days / an hour and a half fro the.x. day of March to y^.x. day of June. In
this season is the best letyng of blood of any time. And tha^ is good to
travail and to be laxatyfe. And to be bathed. And to eat such things as
will purge y^ belly. For all dyseases that comes / either by purging or
bledynge retorneth anon in this prymetyme.

M. Of somer and what it is.
SOmer begins wha^ the son enters y^ first point of the creuyce / and
lasts.xcii. days / and an hour and a half That is to wit fro y^.x. day of
June to ye.x. day of september In this season y^ days belo^ge and y^ nyghtes
short. And i^ al regyo^s e^creaseth and abateth their heat and y^ see is calm
/ and y^ air meke and fair. The f^ours wyther and serpe^tes increase and shed
their venym / and sprede their strength. The myghtes of man's body be
fortyfyed. And all ye world is full of wealth / as y^ fair bryde y^ is goodly
stature and in perfyte aege. The season of somer hot and dry / and tha^ coler
is moeued. And i^ this seas^ is good to beware of all things y^ be hot and
dry of co^ple xyo^. And take heed of to much eating or drinking for thereby
is y^ kyndly heat quenched. In this season eat meats of cold and moist
co^plexyo^ / as veale / mylkew vyneygre / and potages made with barley meal. Eat
fruit of eygre savor / as po^megarnets / and drink small wynes / and use not
the company of women. In this season let the not blood / but if great need
compel the. Use little travail / and seldom bathing.

N. Of Autumpne / or heruest.
HEruest enters wha^ y^ son comes in to y^ first degree of the balaunce and
lasts xci. days and an hour and a half. That is to wit fro the.x. day of
Septe^bre to ye x. day of Decembre. In this season the day and night be of one
length. And tha^ y^ days wax short and y^ nyghtes long. The air is derke^
and y^ wyndes enter the northen regyons or ^^p^e^tryo^. The wether chau^geth /
and y^ ryuers and spr^ges wax le^^^. The orcheyardes and feuytes wydreth. The
beauty of er^he fades. Birds cease their syngyng. Serpe^tes seek their holes
where they assembled their syuyng in somer for y^ time of winter. The earth is
as an o^de naked woman y^ gooth fro youth to aege. This season of heruest is
cold and dry / this time black coler is moved. In this season is good to
eat meats ye be hot ^ moist as cheky^s / lamb / and drink old wynes /
eat sweet reasyns. And keep ye from all things y^ b^^de black coler / as
lyenge with women more than in somer / nor bath ye not but if great need require
it to be done. In this season if a man have need of vomytynge / do it at none
in the hotest of y^ day. For at y^ time a^ y^ superfluytees of man's body
gadreth together A^ o^^ is good to purge y^ belly with a medyeyn ordained therefore
and other things y^ be^ to expul^e black coler and to retrayne humors.

O. Of winter and what it is.
Winter comes wha^ y^ ^on^e e^treth y^ first degree of y^ sign of Caprycorne
and lasts lxx. days / and an hour and a half. And be gy^neth y^.x. day of
Decembre / and co^tynueth to y^.x. day of March. In this season y^ nyghtes be
long and y^ days short / it is very cold. The wynes be in y^ press / and y^
leaves fall / and herbs leeseth all their strength / or the most part. All
bestes hydeth them in caves and pyttes of hills. The air and the wether is
dark. And the earth is like an old decrypyte person / that by great aege is
naked and nygh to the death. winter is very cold and moist / and than behooves
the use hot meats as chekyns / hens / motton and other hot and fat
flesh eat fygges / nuttes / and drink grene wynes. And beware of to much
lare and bledynge / and eschew company of women / for it will feeble thy
stomach / and baches be good. And for the great cold the natural heat enters
in to the body / and therefore the dygestio^ is better in winter tha^ in somer.
And in heruest the belly is cold / and than the poores ben open by heat of the
season / and reproves the natural heat of all the parts of y^ body. And
therefore the stomach has but little heat / whereby the dygestyon is febled /
and the humors assemble there.

P. Of natural heat.
SOne Alexander I pray y^ keep the kyndly heat of thy body / and thou shall
have so^ge health. For the body of man dies in.ij. manners. One is by great aege
the which ouercometh the body and dystroyeth it. The other is accydentally / as
by wepen / sykenesse. or other adventure.

Q. Of things that fatteth the body.
Right dear sone these ben things that fatteth the body. That is to wit ease
of the body and fyllynge it with deynty meats and drynkes / and milk / and tha^
to sleep on a soft bed. All sweet smelling flowers in their season / and
bathing in fresshe waters. But if thou bathe the / tarry not long in it / and
have sweet ^^ne^lynge things in y^ bath. And never drink wine but it be well
tempered with water. And specially in winter make water of flowers calleb
Assyn^n^ and put it in to thy wine / for it is hot or nature. And in somer use
vyolettes and flowers of malowes and other things that be cold / and use to
vomyte ones in a month specially. For vomytes wassheth the body and purges it
of wicked humors and st^nke that is in it. And if there be but few^ humors
in the stomach / it conforteth the na^urall heat. And when thou have vomyte
wyllyngly / the body will fill it with good humydyte and be of good dyspo^ycyon
to dygest. And if thou govern the thus / thou shall be merry at thy heart /
lusty with reasonable health and good understanding / glory and honor / and
over al thyn enemies vyctory. Also I will that thou delight in the beholding o^
goodly persons / or in redynge of delectable bokes^ or in weryng of precious
garments and goodly Iewelles / as the time requires.

R. Of things that leans the body.
THese ben the things that makes the body to be lean / weyke / and dry / to
much eating / to much trauelynge to much walking in the son^e / to much
going / to much slepyng before noone melancoly / fear / to bathe in water of
the nature of brymstone / eating salt meats / to much drinking of old wine
/ to be to laxe / and over much letynge of blood. For ypocras says that he yt
batheth him with a full belly / or lies with a woman shall have sykenesse in his
entrayles. And also to re^ne / or to ride / or to much travail after meat
bredeth a great disease called palsy. And much eating of fysshe / or milk
and wine together ypocras says it will make one lazar

S. Of the first part of the body.
OF ye.iiij. parts of ye body the heed is ye first. For in ye heed gadreth all
superfluytees / and evil humors / which thou shall feel and know by these
signs following. The eyes be^ troubled / the heryng is thycked and is
nosestrylles be^ stopped / if thou feel such a disease take an herb called
worm wood / and sethe it in sweet wine till the half be wasted / tha^ hold it
in thy mouth and wasshe it many times therewith till thou feel yt it does ye
good / and eat white mustard sede powdered with thy meat. And if thou do not
thus thou may happen to have some disease / and specially in thyn eyes / in
thy brayn / and in other pertes of thy body.

T. Of the second part of the body.
THe second part of the body is the bulk / if disease come there thou shall
know it by these signs following The tongue is let / ye mouth is salt /
bitter / and unsavory The mouth of the stomach is sour with grefe in all thy
me^bres. It behooves y^ to eat but little and to vomyte / tha^ eat a little
sugre of roses with aloes and take good co^fortyng spyces and eat an elec^uary
named Dionisiu^. And if thou do not thus / thou may fall in disease of y^ side
/ of y^ raynes / and fevers / and specially of y^ tongue whereby y^ shall not
properly speak / and diverse other maladyes. Decoccyon of ysope is good.

U. Of the third part of the body.
THe third part of the body is the womb / if it be co^bred with evil humors
y^ shall know it by these signs. The belly will swell with pain and styfnesse
in ye knees going a slow pa^e. It behooves to use some subtyle and light
meats / as is said before with the gouernynge. And if y^ do not thus there will
folo we ache in the hyppes / in the mylte / in the back and other joints / and
in the liver / will dygest yon.

X Of the fourth part of the body.
THe fourth perte of the body be^ y^ genytours. if super fluyte and noughty
humors gadre in the^ y^ shall know it by these signs. The appetyte will wax
cold / and reednesse will appear upon the^ and upon y^ share. Tha^ must y^
take a sede called Apu with fenell sede and ye rote of mugwort / and of another
called Acha^ and atracies. And with these herbs put y^ rotes in good white wine
/ and dry^ke a qua^tyte of it every morning with a little water and honey and eat
not much after it. And if y^ do not thus y^ shall have pain in y^ bladder /
and lyu^^ ^ and shalt not pysse / and shall have grefe in y^ intra ^^s and
lunges with brekynge of the stone. Sweet sone Alexander I have read also the
hystoryes of a mighty king / which assembled all the best phylosophres that
were in ynde and Greece. And commanded them to make a medyeyne so prouffytable
that he should need none other for his health. The Greeks said he that drynketh
every morny^g twyse his mouthfull of warm water shall have a good end / and
shall need none other medyeyne. The physycyens of ynde said thar it is good to
eat every day ^astyng a qua^tyte of greynes of white honey. And me seems that
who so takes one of these said medycynes / by reason shall not have pain in
his womb / nor ought not to fear palsy / nor gowte / nor a^he in his
Joints. And who ^o eats every morning.vij. oragmas of clustres of sweet
wine grapes / shall not fear y^ disease of flew me / and it will amend his
mind / and claryfy his understanding / and he needs not to to doubt fever
^uartaynes. And who so eats in^the morning a fygge with nuttes and a
quantyte of leaves ofrue / y^ ^ay shall not need to fear venym.

Of natural heat.
Most mighty king I require the to study the manner to keep the natural heat
of thy body / with ye moisture thereof / in the which two things lies the
health of thy person. And know thou that the destruccyon of the body comes
in two things / one is natural / and the other against nature. And for ye
contraryte of the complexyon of man / and when aege surmounteth y^ body it
behooves for to dye. Other wise unnaturally by adventure / as by wepen / or
stones / or by sykenesse and lack of help / or by venym / and other chances.

Of the qualytees of meats.
Forthermore it is good that thou know the nature of meats / for some be^
gross / or course / and some ben light and subtyle. The subtyle bredeth thyn^e
blood / and good / as pure wheat / chekyns / and new laid eggs Gross meats
ben good for such as ben of hot humors / laborers / fasting / and y^ sleep
after meals. Mean meats bredeth no hot nor superfluous humors / as the
flesh of lambs / yo^ge porke / and other that be^ hot and moist / but
such meats change often in rostynge to hardness / to heat / and dryenesse
And they ought to be eaten forth with after the rosty^ge / and ben good if they
be so taken with good spyces. Some meats bread melancoly / as befe / cowes
flesh / and all flesh that is course and dry Other that bread and feed in
moist and warry / and shadowy places ben more subtyle / better and holsomest.

Y. Of the nature of fysshe.
Fysshes that been of small substan^ce / and thynne skynnes / ^asy of eating /
bredde in rennynge waters nyghe the sea be^ better and lyghter than they that
bredde in y^ see or fresshe ryners. But fysshe that bredeth in y^ see is
holsomer tha^ fresshe river fysshe. Therefore beware of fysshe of great
substance with hard skynnes for such be^ comynly venomous.

A. Of the nature of waters.
THou ought to know y^ clear re^nynge waters that been nyghe to cytees in pure
ground as small brokes be the best and lyghtest. water that comes out of
stony earth where as is much fumosytees is heavy / co^tagyous / and noysom.
water of puddles or fenne full of frogs / addres / and other venymous worms
be unwholesome. The signs of good water is to be clear / light / and of good
color / yt lightly does se the and lightly cool. In such waters nature
delyteth salt. water of ye see is fumysshe and laxeth y^ womb / and water of
ye see is hot and heavy because it moeueth not / and the son is daily over it
/ and it bredeth coler / and creaseth the mylt and the sunges. The dry^kynge of
waters with a cold stomach fasting before dinner greueth the body / and
quenches the heat of the stomach. But drinking of water after dinner warmeth
the stomach and bredeth flewme. And much of it corrupts the meat in the
stomach. Thou ought to drink cold water in somer and warm water in winter
/ and not contrary wise. For warm water in somer molly fyeth and weyketh the
stomach / and wastes the appetyte. And in winter cold water que^cheth the
heat / and destroys the instruments of the breast / it noyeth the lyghtes
and lu^ges and bredeth many greues.

B. Of the nature of wine.
THe nature of wine that grows on mountains nygh to y^ son is dryer tha^
that / that grows on the plain ground / in moist places / and shadows wine
is good for aeged people / and such as be moist and slewmy. And enoyeth them
that be young and hot. And wine warmeth and delyuereth cold and course
superfluytees. The reeder and thycker that wine is the more it bredeth blood.
But if it be strong and bitter / tha^ it is called the first blood and the
first nourysshyng / and has the nature of drink and medycyne And often
drouke^ it noyeth the body and nouryssheth it not. And wha^ wine is naturally
sweet / it noyeth the stomach with smellynges and wyndes but such wine is
comynly sweet of co^plexyon / and such as grows in large feeldes stretchynge
toward the mountains and valees having sweet clustres / ^ and ripe / and be
not gathred till the might of the substance of the bery is gone with the
moystnesse / and y^ the vine and the grape be somewhat wydred. And thou shall
know that wine ought to be of an eygte taste sharp and pleasant / and have
thyeke lies on the botome of the vessel / and fair and clear above / and when
thou have fair and good wine drink temperatly thereof to ye ease of thy body /
as the time requires. For it stre^gtheth the stomach and the heates of y^ body
/ and helps dygestyon and keeps from corrupcyon / and typeth the meat in
the members / puryfyeng it / and works in the^ till it be co^iun^t in good
blood / and nourysshynge / and trauayleth and reyseth the heat of the body
temperately. And keeps a man sure of wicked humors / it gladdeth the heart /
and makes fresshe color in the face. It ^uyckeneth the mind and soupleth the
tongue / and destroys all melancoly / and make a man bold / and to have good
courage and appetyte. And has many other good propryetees. But if wine be
outrageously taken many inconuenyences come thereby. It troubles ye brain / ye
mind / yt wits / ye understanding. It makes the virtue of natural ^eate
wild / and causes forgetfulness. It co^breth the ^o^gue and weyketh all y^
synewes and lymmes of ye body. It makes the eyes reed and blered. It chau^geth
ye color / and destroys ye body / and makes course and noughty blood. It
marreth dygestyon. It causes to many words / and to much sleep. It makes ye
mouth stynkynge. It lets ye going / and dystroyeth y^ sede of man and
bredeth lepry. Beware therefore yt thou drink not wine outrageously / but moeue
and change ye nature thereof with rewbarbe which causes ye liver to live. And
wine with Rubarbe has many virtues as is found plainly in books of physyke.
Howbeit Rubarbe and wine be both deedly ven^ if they be outragyously taken.
And surely all euyls comes of wine vnmeasurably dronken.

C. Of goodness and harm yt comes of wine.
NOble king Alexander / forgete not to take tarte syropes in ye morning
fasting when flewmatyke humors habou^de to much. For it is proufytable and
wastes the^ much. Also I marvel y^ any man may dye or be seek that eats
breed of clean and good wheat / wholesome and good flesh / and drynketh good
wine of grapes temperatly. And if he keep him fro to much drynkyng / eating
and travail. if sykenesse over come such a man he must be healed as a dronke^
man. That is to wit he must be washed with warm water / and tha^ set over a
re^nyng water between.ii. grene wylowes / and his stomach anointed with an
oy^teme^t of sandres / or sandalles / and have a fumy gacyo^ of fra^ke^se^ce:
and other sweet spyces / and it will do him much good And if any man will
forsake holly ye drynkyng of wine / he ought not to leave it suddenly at ones
but little and little / and to me^gle it every day with water more and move / till
at the last there be nothing but clear water. And so he may keep his health and
good co^plexyon. Thus govern thy body if thou will live long. And keep my
doctrynes / and consydre these things following wherein nature conforteth
gretely. That is to wit. Goodly pastymes / sight of great rychesses / great
^euerence / vyctory over enemies / fedyng on good meats / noise of mynstralsy
/ sight of precious garments / often herynge of good tidings / speech or wise
men to enquere of things past and to come / and co^munycacyon with fair
gentyl women.

D. Of the form of Justice.
O Most dyscrete king Justice ca^ not be praised to much / for it is of
meruaylous sharp nature / like to the most glorious god. And he ordained it
over his angels over his works / and over al realms. And thou ought to keep
Justice / and defend the wits / the rychesses / and possessions of thy
subgectes and all their works / for so does almighty god. And any lord doing
in like case is like to god. For by mayntey^rg of Justice he follows god / and
thou ought to follow him in all needful works. And this is the form of
understanding the which god created / and granted to his creatures. By
Justice the erche was made / and kings ordained to keep and maynteyne Justice
for it makes subgectes meke and obedyent / proud men lowly / and keeps all
persons in saufe fro wrongs and domages. And therefore they of ynde say that
the Justice of a good lord is better to good subgectes than the plentyousnesse
of the earth. And also they say that the Just and reasonable lord is better
tha^ the rain that falls in the euenyng. And there was ones found written in
a stone in the speech of Caldee that wise kings ben brethren hauyyge need
each of other / and one may not be without the other. For all the kings of
the world be to rule / and maynteyne Justice / which is the health of
Justice. Therefore if thou have any thing for to do ask council / for thou
art but one man. And show not all thy courage to thy councelers nor let the^
not know what is in thy will to do. For if y^ show thy mind at ye beginning
you shall be dyspraysed. Tha^ attempre thyn heart / and thy will / but here
council first. And manyfeste not that / that lies at thy heart till thou come
to put it in effect. Consydre well the council of every man. And which of
them has Iuged thy matter and counceled ye best for the / and with the best
love that he has toward yt. And wha^ thou have thus recorded thy council /
put thy mind in effect without delay. For the gretest destruccyon that may
come to a king is to bestow in his works and to lose time. And if so be that
a young man of small estate give the good council / despise it not / for it is
possible that a man may be borne in such co^stellacyo^ y^ naturally he shall
have wisdom. Example.

There was upon a time a child borne in the parties of ynde. In the house where
this child was borne were certain wise men lodged / which found that the
said child was borne under such a constellacyon / planet / and sign that he
should be wise / meke / courteys / amyable / fresshe of wit / and should be
loved of kings and great lords. which thing they would not show to ye fader
which was a weuer. wha^ ye child came to aege ye fader and moderset him to
their occupacio^ / but he could never learn for any beatyng nor chastyseme^t.
At ye last they let him do as he list / and he set his mind to learn scye^ces
/ and ye moeuynges of ye skies / and of all things above nature. Also he
learned good co^dycyo^s and manners to ye governance of princes and kings. And
finally by his wit and wisdom he was ruler of all ye country. Another
example. In ye realm of ynde were.ii. children / wha^ one of the^ came to aege
ye king set hy^ to scole for to learn seyece and all ye studyes of ynde and had
ye best techers in all y^ prouynces for to teache him in all y^ speed y^ could
^e possible as to a kings sone belonged. But all the dylyge^ces of his fader
and other techers auayled nothing nor could make him enclyne neither by his
master nor by his nature to learn any seye^ce nor art but only forgynge or
smythes craft / whereof the king merueyled / and sore troubled sent for all
the wysest of his realm / and demanded of the^ how it might be that his sone
would learn nothing but only smythes craft. And they answered that the kind
of the child was of such complexyon / and that he was inclyned to that art
and to none other. Therefore dear sone Alexander despise no man of low birth
nor of small stature if thou se any science or any wisdom in him / and that he
have also good condycyons and manners in him / and booth exchewe vices. Such
one so well manered is wrothy to be loved of princes and kings. And thou ought
for to do nothing without counsel. And I pray the dear sone that thou love
him y^ loves truth and y^ cou^celeth y^ faithfully and ^^^^tyme contrary to
thyn opinion. For such a man is steadfast of courage / faithful and Just to ye
and thy subgectes. And ye counsel of such a man is good to ye gouernayle of ye
king and of his realm. For ^hermore let not thy besynesses y^ should be
first done be y^ last. etc. But do every thing by counsel and order For
counsel is ye shewer of al things to come. It is behoueful therefore y^ y^ do
all thy works by counsel of faithful and secret cou^celers. For thy wysdo^
by ye counsel of the^ shall increase / as the sea e^creaseth by ye ryuers and
floodes y^ fall in to it. And ye better you may win by ye might of
warryours. It is found wryte^ y^ a great wise man of ynde wrote lettres to his
sone in this wise My well beloved sone / it is behouefull y^ you believe counsel
in all thy besynesses / for you art but one man. Take counsel therefore of such
as you know can give the good. And above all things spare not thy enmy / but
wha^ you may show thy vyctory over hy^ And ever beware of y^ power of thy
e^my. Trust not in thy own wit nor i^ y^ great heyght of thyn estate / but
ever take counsel of other / which if thou seem good and prouffytable accept
it / and else not. And also I admonest ye and counsel ye chefely y^ thou
never make none of thy officers thy lyeftenau^t only nor give hy^ thy might /
for his cou^ may destroy ye / thy realm / and thy subgectes. And seek always to
his own prouffyt and thy undoing. But thou ought to have diverse officers / and
if you will assay and prove any of the^ thou must feign y^ you have great need of
money. And if he council the to take of thy treasure and Iewelles for to speed
he loves ye and is faithful to y^. And if he counsel the to take ye money of
thy subgetes to make the^ poor he is corrupt and hates the much. But if he
be such one that will off^e the his own goods and say. Sir by the gift and
grace of god I have gotten some goods I give them to the / such ought to be
praised and loved best / as he which had lever to give his goods away than
the poor subgectes should be taxed and destroyed. Prove also thy officers and
if thou se that any of them does his office dylygently and more for thyn
honor than he is co^mycted / thou ought greatly to trust in him. And if there
be any that delyteth in taking of gifts and gapeth for promocyo^ / and to
gadre treasure / put not thy trust in him. For such a man is like a hurl
pytte without botome / for the more that he has the more he coueyteth to have.
And such one is the destruccyon of a realm many ways. For peradventure the
brennynge desire that he has to get rychesses may moeue him to do many
euylles / and may chance the procuracyon of thy death. if thou perceive such
an offycer / let him not be far from thy presence. And suffer him not to
make treaty with strange lords nor princes / nor write no news to them. And
if thou doubt that he does the contrary change him without any delay. For the
courage of many men be soon changed / and lightly inclyned to do contrary
things. Also dear sone thou ought to cherysshe ye offycer that loves and
moeueth thy subgectes to love the. And that puts his person and good^s to
thyn honor / and that has these propryetees following. that is to wit that
he be parfyt in his lymmes for to travail in his office that he is chosen to.
That he be courteys / lowly / and eloquent / and that his word accord with
his heart. That he be a clerk wise and well condycyoned / laborous and sober of
mouth in eating and drinking / not lecherous / nor player at dyce and other
dysordynate games. That he be hardy / and set not his mind on gold nor silver
/ nor other thing of the world / but that / y^ belongs to the governance
of the / and the realm. That he love the wealth of his neighbors as of the^
that be ^erre. And that he hate all wrongs / and by Justice yield every man
his own. That he be angry with the^ that do iniuryes and extorcyons / and that
he grieve no man wro^gefully. And that he be perseueraun^ and steadfast in his
purpose which is behouefull. That he be without fear and in good will. That he
know the stynce of his expenses. And that he prolonge nothing that may be
prouffytable to the realm. And y^ gives not thy subgectes cause to compain
of him in doing against y^ comy^ well. That he be not full of words / nor a
great laugher. That none be refused comy^g to his house And that he be dylygent
to here and enquere of news and tidings That he comfort the subgectes and
correct their works / and help the^ in their aduersytees.

E. Of kings secretaryes.
Dear sone it behooves to choose the a secretary for to write and know thy
secrets / he must be a man of great wisdom and well learned / for to
understand thy mind. He ought to be trusty and eloque^t and that can speak
diverse languages for to put thy besynesses in goodly ordinance and semely
speech. For as a fair garment honors y^ body of a king / so goodly speech
arayeth and indeweth a lettre. And also he must be trusty to hyde and keep
close thy doings. And y^ he suff^e none to come to y^ place where thy
wrytynges be and ye none se the^. Sweet sone such persons ought to be
cherysshed and well rewarded for their seruyces. And exalte the^ in such wise
y^ they be always dylygent in thy necessytees and needs. For in the^ is
contained thy glory and honor / or thy life and destruccyon.

F. Of a kings messagers.
Mighty emperor ye messagers always shows the wysoome of him y^ sends the^.
They ben ye eyes ye eeres / and the mouth of their lord It behooves for thy
messagers or a^bassadours to choose such as be^ most suffycye^t / of clear
understanding / wise / honorable / and trusty / which loves thy honor / and
hates thy dishonor. (For in thy court you may find the^ both). And if you
find such discover and show thy courage to the^. And if you find none such
or better / find one y^ will trustely bear thy lettres / and bring the an
answer of them. And if you find y^ thy messager be coueytous to do his own
prouffyte and to get gifts / trust not in him / but e^tyerly forsake him.
And also make no man thy messager y^ will be dronke / for by such one it shall
be said and known y^ ye lord is not wise. And ferthermore make not thy
messager of thy gretest offycer / and let him not be far from the / for it
may well be the undoing of the and y^ realm. And if you send messagers by
whom any treason come to the / I tell the not y^ measure of pain y^ they ought
to suffer but do therein as thou semest best.

G. Of the governance of the people.
Fair sone thou know y^ thy people and subgectes be^ ye house of thy mind /
and y^ treasure whereby thy realm is comforted. For thy realm and subgectes
be^ as an orchyarde wherein be^ diverse trees berynge fruit / the which trees
have diverse rotes and seeds for to bear / grow / and multyply ye fruit / and
be y^ defense and durable treasoure to thy realm / and of thy might. It
behooves than that thy subgectes be well governed and y^ thou take thought and
care to that / that is needful for the^ / and to beware that no vyole^ce nor
wrongs be done to them / and after their condycyons and wontes to order them.
Than give to them a good offycer that inte^deth not to their undoing / but
that intends to rule them well / Justly and in quyete. And se that such an
offycer be wise / full of good manners / well condycyoned / and pacyent. For if
he be not such one / wit thou y^ the wise men that were good before / will
become evil and rebel against the. Also se that thou have good and dyscrete
Iuges and y^ shall be worship to the / and increase of thy court / and of thy
reame. And that the said Iuges be not corrupt with gifts and mede / and that
they have good notaryous serybes / and egall sollycitours and advocates y^ will
not take brybes as it happens seldom. Dear sone I pray the and admonest the
that thou put thy self often in battle / and take oftentimes the council of
them of thy court. But put the not with the^ that only by envy and couetyse
enters presumptuously in battle. And blame not nor despise thy me^ of war /
but use fair words among them / and often promise the^ gifts and honors.
And in no wise put thy self in battle till thou be pourueyed of al necessary
arms and other things thereto belonging. And when y^ see thyn enmy renew
suddenly upon him / and not slowly / and ever have good outryders and watches
about thyn host. And lodge the always as nyghe as thou may to hills /
woods and waters. And have always more habou^dau^ce of vytayle tha^ needs And
above al things great quantyte of trompettes ^abours and other mynstrelles.
For they give force might / and rejoice them that be with the / and make
dyuysyo^ and fear to thyn enemies. And be not always armed i^ one harneys / but
with diverse. And be well stored with archers and handgo^nes. And ordeyne some
of thy men to run / and other to stand steadfastly in thy ba^ayles. Conforte
thy men with fair words and give them courage / and herty them to fight. And
above all things dear sone beware of treason with all thy power / and have
ever good knights about the well and swyftely horsed that if chance happen
that thou must needs flee / that by them thou may save thy person. But if
thou see any of thyn enemies fle haste the not to chase the^ but keep thy folk
always together the most that thou may. And if thou wylt assawte castelles or
towns have great quantyte of gynnes / and artyllery for to break the walls.
And pouruey the of conning myners / and great no^bre of archers and crosbowes.
And do so that thou may take away the water from them of the fortress. And
ever keep some of thy enmyes for to know their doings within. And if thou can
not have it but by battle do it. For always the last end of their works
ought to be battle. And this ought to be done wha^ thou can not have them
otherwise. And do all thy works by council and not hastily.

Of the physonomy of people.
Among all other things of this world I will that thou know a noble and
meruaylous s^ye^ce that is called physonomy by the which thou shall know the
nature and condycyo^ of people. And it was found by a phylosophre named
Physonomyas / the which sought the qualytees of the nature of creatures In the
time of the said Physonomyas reigned the most wise physycye^ y^ pocras. And
because the fame of physonomyas and his wisdom was so gretely spreddde / the
dyscyples and servants of ypocras took his figure secretly / and bare it to
Physonomyas to here how he would Judge and say by ye said figure of ypocras. And
bade him say and tell the qualyte thereof. when Physonomyas had well beholden it
/ he said. This man is a wrangeler lecherous and rude. This herynge the
dyscyples of ypocras / they would have flayne Physonomyas / and said to him. A^
fool this is the figure of the best man of the world. wha^ Physononomyas saw
them thus moeued / he appeased them the best way that he could with fair
words saying. I know well that this is the figure of the wise man ypocras.
And I have showed you by science as I know. when the dyscyples were come to
ypocras they told him what Physonomyas had said. And ypocras said. Truly
Physonomyas has told you the truth / and has left no thing of my
complexyon in the which ben all my vices. But reason that is in me ouercometh
and rules the vices of my complexyon. Dear sone I have shortly abreged to the
/ the rules of this science of Physonomy / the which shall infourme the
gretely. if thou se a man with salowe color / flee his company / for he is
inclyned to the sin of lechery / and to many euylles. if thou see a man
that smyleth lightly / and when thou beholdest him he will look shamfastly and
will blusshe in his face and sygh with teeres in his eyes if thou blame him for
any thing / surely he fears the and loves thy person Beware of him as thy
enmy that is tokened in his face / and of him also that is mysshapen. The best
co^plexyon that is / is he that is of mean color with brown eyes and here
and his vysage between why and reed / with an vpryght body / with a heed of
metely bygnesse / and that speaks not but of need be / with a soft voice /
such a complexyon is good / and such men have about the. if the heeres be
plain and smothe the man is curteys and meke / and his brain is cold. Hard
here and curled is a token of folly and lewdness. Much here on the breast and
on the belly betokens very ill or very good complexyo^ naturally and is very
amerous / and keeps in his heart the iniuryes y^ has be^ done to him. Black
here betoke^eth to love reason and Justice. Duskysshe eyes betokens fooly /
and lightly to be angry. Gray eyes betokens honest / and louy^ge peace. Bygge
eyes betoke^eth to be^ enuyous / unshamefast / slow and vnobedyet. Eyes mean
between black and yelowe is of good understanding / curteys / and trusty. wide
retch ynge eyes and a long face betokens a man malycyous and ill. Eyes like
an ass always lokyng down is of hard nature and naught. waueryng eyes with a
lo^ face betokens gyle / rennynge mind and untrusty Reed eyes betokens to
be strong and of a great cou^age. He that has spekles about his eyes / white
/ black / or reed / is the worst of all other men. Thycke heered eye lyddes is
an ill speker / he that has them haugynge long to his eyes / is neither true
nor clean. He that has here enough between his two brows and be thyn^e and
not to long / is of a good and great understanding. Asklendre nosed man is
soon angry. A long nose hawked to the mouth / is a toke^ of honest and
hardynesse A snytted nose is a token to be soon vexed. wide nosethrylles in a
man is sloth and boystousnesse and soon angered. A broad nose in the mids
is a great speker / and a liar. But y^ best is he that is mean neither to wide
nor to close. The vysage that is full and flat / and that is not swollen nor to
bygge is a token of an ill person / enuyous / iniuryous / and a wra^geler. But
he that has a mean vysage of form of chekes and eyes / neither to fat nor
to lean / he is trusty / loving / and of great understanding / wise and full
of service and wit. He that has a wide mouth loves battle and is hardy.
He y^ has thycke lyppes is folysshe. And he that has a wrynkled face is a
liar / and cares not of many debates. He that has a sklender face is of great
reason. He that has a little vysage and yelowe of color is a deceyuer /
dronken / and ^uyll. Full eyes and smothe chekes is soon angry. Small eeres
betokens folly / and l^chery. He that has a small voice and speaks thycke
loves feyghtynge. He that has a mean voice / neither to bygge / nor to
little / is folysshe and unreasonable. And he that speaks to much with a
sklender voice / is not over honest / and of small care. He that has a femynyne
voice is soon angry / and of ill nature. A soft voyced man is often angry and
e^uyous. He that has a fair voice / is folysshe / and of high courage. He
that speaks lightly / lies often / and is a deceyuer. And he that speaks
without moeuynge his hands / is of great wisdom and honest. He that has a
sklender neck / is hot / peceytfull / and folysshe. He y^ has a great belly
is proud / lecherous / and unwise. He that has a large breast / thycke
sholdres / and bygge fyngers / is hardy / wise / gentle / and of good wit.
He with a sklender back agrees never with any other. He y^ has his breast and
back egall / is a token of honest. Hye raised sholdres / is a toke^ of little
fydelyte / naught / and sharp. He that has long arms rechynge to the knee /
is of great boldness / sadness / and lyberalyte. Short arms betoken that
he loves socour / and is folysshe. Long palmed hands with long fyngers / is
ordained to learn many scye^ces / and arts / and specyal handy crafts / and
be of good governance. Fyngers short and thycke / betoken folly. Short thycke
fete and flesshy / betokens to be folysshe / and full of injury. A little
light foot / is a man of small understanding. A sklender foot shows a man to
be simple / and of small knowledge. He that has a thycke foot is hardy and
folysshe. The length of y^ legs / and the heles betoken strength of the body.
A thycke flesshy kne / is soft and weyke. A man that gooth a great pace / is
willing in all things / and to hasty. He is of a good nature and complexyon /
that has soft flesh and moist / meanly smothe and rough / and that is
kyndly between reed and white. He that has a smothe contenaunce / soft here
and plain / with mean eyes of bygnesse / with a well proporcyoned heed / a
good neck and suffycyent in length / with sholders somdele low / and his
legs and knees metely flesshed his voice competent clear / y^ palms of his
hands and fyngers long and not thycke / and that he laughe but little / and
that is no mocker / with a smylyng chere and merry / is of good co^plexyon.
Howbeit dear sone I command the not to Judge al upon one sign / but consydre
all the tokens of a man which most habounde and shows y^ folly in him / and
hold the to the best and most prouffytable party.

Deo gratias.
Thus ends the abstract of the secret of secrets of Arystotle prince of
Phylosophres.
Here follow certain reasons of the great phylosophre Sydrac to the king
Boctus / which I have translated out of the Pycardes speech / thinking it
necessary in this said treatise.

How one ought to vttre his speech.
IF thou have any matter of grauyte or sadness of reason / to show and declare
before noble and wise audyence / tell it breuely and wisely / with a good bold
courage and will / and than they will take it hertely / and will give credence
to thy words and allow thy saying. For wise men will gladly give eeres to wise
and short informacyon. And therefore be not shamefast nor afe^de to tell the
troth. For many one have lost their right by shamefastness and frate of their
vtteraunce of words / though their causes were good.

The manner of anger.
THou ought not to be angry though thy brother or friend show the heavy chere
sometime / for peradventure he has some cause wherefore he can show the / nor
other no fair semblaunt. And this thou may co^sydre in thy self. For if
thou were angry thou could show him / nor none other good chere or
countenance / and so it is with him. And if thou have had any words with any
man / and he show the ill countenance / therefore yet thou ought not to be
angry with him. For perchance he is ^oo lewd or vnwytty of himself that he
can do no better / and yet he weneth that he does well / for ever the lewdest
shows most anger. For when a wise man is angry / he shows it not outward
by his reason. A man ought more to fear the anger of a wise man than of a
fool / for the wise man can better revenge his anger than a fool / howbeit
that a foles anger is often comberous.

To vttre secrets.
IN one manner only thou ought to show thy secrets / that is to wit to
almighty god that knows al thing / that is to be understand / to his
lyeftenau^t in earth / and other wise not. For if thou dyscouer it to thy
friend. And if thy friend be but lewd / and has another friend yt he loves /
to whom he tells thy secret / and his friend has another friend that
tells him the same / and so from one to another till a great meyny do know
it / and so thy secret may come out to thy great shame and rebuke. For whiles
thou kepest thy secret within the / it is sure. For thou may show thy
secret to such one that when he knows it will do the some wrong / and for
fear that thou have of him yt dare not gaynsay him leest he bewrey the. And if
thou can none otherwise but that thou must vttre it by thy folly / and that thy
stomach will swell for to tell it / go out of company and tell it to thy self as
if thou would tell it to another man / and thy heart will cool and thy stomach
swage. And for any need that thou have to dyscouer it / take heed to whom / but
if it be to such one that for any anger that thou do to him will not rebuke
the with it. And never let thy neighbor know thy need / for thereby thou may
be the less set by in places where thou dwell.

How thou ought to sport with thy friend.
Look wisely how thou playest or bourdest with thy friend (or other) with thy
hands or with thy mouth / for if thou do him harm / harm may come to the.
with sporty^g with hands comes anger and murdre / whyther it be thy brother
or friend. For if thou hurt him or wring his hand / or cast him down / or
smite him otherwise / it shall grieve him / and shame him in his mind / albeit
that he be little and weyke / for each in him self counts him strong /
bold and fyers / and yet he will praise him self though he be a cowarde and
naught. And if thou mock him / thou shall spyte him to the heart / for he will
think that thou dyspysest him / and y^ thou reputeth him at naught. And if
thou mock him before people / thou do him yet more spyte / and he shall owe
the yil will and hate the deedly. For of mocking comes anger and great hate /
though it be thy brother or other friend. But thou ought to pastyme with fair
words / and to show goodly auctorytees and reasons to draw their love to the
/ for by that pastaunce thou may come to y^ goodness / love and curteysy of
people.

The manner to doubt and trust thyn enemy.
WHyther thyn enemy be strong or weyke / thou ought not to doubt him to much
/ nor trust to much to him. For he y^ is overcome to day / may be vyctour to
morrow. And he that is vyctour to day may be overthrown to morrow. And he that
doubts none / none will have doubt of him. To much doubt makes to much trust
/ and to much trust makes to much damage. For he that bears doubt always with
him / has a great burden and pain. And he that has trust in him self /
bears his own damage / and his death. For you ought to doubt when time is to
doubt / and to trust when time is to trust.

Trembling for dread before thy sovereign

where any person shall the there retain
Submytte thy self as one that would be feign
His grace to please in all manner degree
And of thy rudeness for to pardon the
And where as thou art but as an abstract
As touching the auctours compylacyon
if I therefore be any wise detract
In defaut of thy abreuyacyon
Lay thou the blame in the ^rensshe ^ranslacyon
which I have followed as nygh as I can
Under correccyon of every wise man.
if any man despise the language rude
which barayne is / of puryd eloquence
Desire them that they do not delude
Thy frouysate matter full of sentence
But in there hertes / enprynt thy moral sense.
which compyled is / by wisdom natural
Of prudent men / the very gouernall
where many wedes be in a field of corn
All though the weders think to wede it clean
Some shall remain / when the fylde is shor^^.
Drawke or cokle / yet there will be seen
The fawtes thereof / is in the hands and eyes
Likewise where many / words and lettres be
No marvel is / though I some ouerse
if by impressyon / any thing be amys
In word / in sense / or in ortography
I you require / to mende where the fault is
In the best wise / it for to Iustyfy
For though all be not to your fantasy
In formal manner / do ye it dyscus
Save only god / nemo est perfectus.
