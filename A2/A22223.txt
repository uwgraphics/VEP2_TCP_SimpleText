A Proclamation for prevention and restraint of the abuses and inconveniences,
occasioned by dying with Logwood.
WHereas many good Laws and Statutes have been heretofore made and
established, prohibiting the Importation of a certain false and deceitful
dying stuff or wood, called Logwood or Blockewood, which said Statutes did
not produce that good effect that thereby was intended (the seizing and taking
of the said Wood being wholly neglected) for that no satisfaction or
recompense was by the Law offered or allowed to such as employ their pains and
endeavor in the discovery and seizure thereof; whereupon We for further
prevention of the said deceipts, have made several Restraints by Our Letters
Patents, Books of Rates, and otherwise, thereby to hinder the importation and
abuse of the said wood; By which means, albeit great quantities of the said
wood have been seized and burnt, yet the said wood is still privily imported
and disposed of, within this Our Kingdom, to the hurt and prejudice of Our
Subjects: We, having taken these things into Our consideration, and out of Our
Princely care, desiring to pursue Our former purpose in preventing whatsoever
might be hurtful to Our Subjects, and on the contrary to give them relief in
things useful and necessary; And being informed that the importation and use
thereof for diverse sorts of course Stuffes, Linen of all sorts, Caddoes,
Ribband, Inckle, Tape, Cappes, Gloves, Hattes, Leather for points, Brushes,
couers for Books, Saddles, Stools and Chaires, and Thread of diverse sorts,
with many other Haberdashery wares, that cannot conveniently be dyed or
colored without Logwood or Blockwood, by reason of the cheapnesse, and the
gloss it gives to such mean commodities, far better then any other Stuff
can do, is most necessary and not prejudicial to any of Our Subjects; have
thought meet to License the importation of some competent quantity of the
said wood, to be employed and used only about such needful uses as aforesaid;
And withal to add some further provision for restraint of the immoderate
importation of the said wood, tending to the abuse and deceit of Our people:
And therefore have by Our Letters Patents under Our great Seal of England,
given License to Our well-beloved Servant and Subject Sir Thomas Compton Knight,
and his Assigns, as well to import into this Kingdom yearly the quantity of
fifty Tonnes of Logwood, and no more, as to take into his or their hands the
moytie of all Logwood imported by others, and seized as forfeited, the other
part thereof being first burnt; Nevertheless under these cautions and
provisions following, viz. That there shall not be uttered or sold by him or
his Assigns, above the aforesaid yearly quantity of fifty Tonnes of Logwood
or Blockwood, and to none other use or uses, then the good and necessary uses
before mentioned; And that he or they shall not directly or indirectly import
any greater quantity then fifty Tonnes yearly; And that the same, with all
such Logwood as shall be seized and come to his or their hands, shall be
registered in the Custom House in London, in Our Register there kept for
forfeitures, with the name of the Master of the Ship, and owner of the wood,
to the end that it may be known who shall presume to import the same,
contrary to Our pleasure; And that as well the wood by him the said Sir Thomas
Compton, his Executors or Assigns, to be imported, as otherwise to come to his
or their hands upon seizure, which shall be sold or vented within this Realm,
shall be ground and sold in an appointed place in the City of London, and
not elsewhere; And that upon such sale, the names and place of abode of all
such as shall buy Logwood, shall be taken and registered, and for what use they
buy the same; And that so much of the said Logwood as shall come unto the hands
of the said Sir Thomas Compton or his Assigns, by importation or otherwise, as
shall exceed the quantity of fifty Tonnes in any one year, shall be by him
or them shipped forth of this Kingdom, within three months after the same
shall come to his or their hands or possession: And likewise that the said Sir
Thomas Compton or his Assigns, shall at all times, being thereunto required,
give notice to whom the same Logwood is sold, that inquiry may be made,
whether the buyer thereof do use the same contrary to the orders prescribed.

And the better to encourage such as will employ their endeavor in and about
the discovery and seizure of the said wood, to the end the abuse thereof in
dying Cloth and woollen commodities may be taken away, and the good use thereof
only maintained and cherished, It is likewise provided in the said Letters
Patents, that the said Sir Thomas Compton, his Executors and Assigns, shall
pay to all such as shall seize any Logwood, the sum of six pounds per Tonne,
and so by the hundredth accordingly, So that he that makes the seizure, do
first deliver the one half of such wood to the Mayor, Bayliffe, or Justice of
Peace where it shall be seized, to be burnt, and then bring the other half to
the Patentee, or his Assigns, with Certificate from some of the said Officers
that the one half is burnt, As by Our said Letters Patents more at large
appears: We, to the end all Our loving Subjects may take notice of Our
gracious purpose and intention, whereby the same may take better effect for the
general good of this Our Kingdom, Do by this Our Proclamation publish and
give notice to all men, whom the premises shall in any wise concern, That Our
express will and pleasure is, that all and every the Cautions, Provisions,
Restraints, and other the premises aboue-mentioned, be carefully and
diligently performed and observed.

And therefore We do hereby charge and command all Mayors, Sheriffs,
Bayliffes, Justices of Peace, Customers, Comptrollers, Searchers, Surueyours,
Waiters, Constables, Headboroughs, and all other Our Officers and Ministers,
not only to be careful and diligent in the discovering and punishing of all
and singular offenses and offenders in this behalf, but also to be from time
to time aiding and assisting unto the said Sir Thomas Compton, his Executors,
Administrators and Assigns, and to his and their Deputy and Deputies, and to
all other persons which shall find and seize any of the said Logwood or
Blockwood, imported, used, or employed contrary to this Our will and command.

Given at Our Palace of White Hall, the nine and twentieth day of February, in
the seventeenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God
save the King.

most Excellent Majesty. ANNO DOM. M. D C. XIX.
