the Justices see the same straightly observed, And that they do certify the
same before the end of Trinity Term next, to the Lords of his Majesty's
privy Council, to the end, if cause so require, further directions may be
added hereunto.

Town corporate, having authority to hold sessions of the Peace, where such
Alehouse shall be, And the same Seal shall be appointed and provided by the
Clearke of the Peace, or Towne-Clearke respectively; For the charge of making
whereof, they shall have allowance made out of their next receipt.

Justices of the peace, whereof one to be of the Quorum,) shall subscribe their
names to every page of the said book, that no alteration may be made. And that
the said Justices, or one of them keep a true note of the number of such
Alehouses entered into such book, that it may be known for what number and
for what time the Clarke of the peace and Town Clarke ought to answer.

BEfore the end of Easter Term next, a true and perfect book shall be made by
the Clarke of the Peace of every Shire, and the Town Clarke of every City or
Town Corporate (having authority to keep Sessions of peace) containing all
the Alehouses and Victualling houses in every several County, City and
Town Corporate, within this Realm, and how many, and who they be that keep
them. And that before the end of Trinity Term next, a true and perfect
Transcript be made of the same by the Clarke of the Peace or Town Clarke

of the Shire, City or Town Corporate, or of four of them (whereof two to be

one to be of the Quorum) to the Lords of his Majesty's most honorable privy
Council, and the like book and in like manner and form to be yearly made,
and certified at and within the times aforesaid.

ALso that it be carefully looked into that the number of Alehouses be not
increased but diminished, and specially that none be suffered to keep
Alehouses unlicensed, or otherwise licensed then according to the prescript
aforesaid.

Saving, that in case where any Ale-house-keeper, Licensed as aforesaid, shall
die or remove, or for his ill rule or misbehauiour, thought fit by two Justices
of the Peace, whereof one to be of the Quorum, to be put down, That then such
other to be appointed in the same Parish or Hamlet, as shall be Licensed and
allowed as aforesaid, at the next Sessions of the Peace, or general Assembly
of the Justices, whereat five Justices of the Peace, with the Clearke of the
Peace, or his Deputy shall be present.

LAstly, That the Justices of Assize in their Circuits, and Justices of Peace
at their general Sessions of the Peace, do from time to time enquire of the
due execution of these presents, and of all Alehouses kept without such
License, as aforesaid, and of all other abuses, disorders, briberies,
extortions, deceipts, and other misdemeanors whatsoever, committed or suffered
against the provisions aforesaid, and the true meaning of them.
