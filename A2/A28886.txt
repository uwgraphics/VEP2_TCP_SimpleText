A LETTER SENT By a Yorkshire Gentleman, to a friend in London: Being a full
and true Relation of the proceedings between his Majesty and the County of
York, at Heworth Moore, upon Friday, June. 3.
Also the most material passages of this Week, from London, Westminster, etc.
Worthy Sir,
MY Engagements to you command the passages of this day; I am confident the
Printed Summons so long before published, and the several adjournments of our
meeting have begot in you, as in all parts about us, strong expectations of the
issue.

In the first place, his Majesty attended with diverse Lords of the House of
Peers, and the 140. Troopers of Knights and Gentlemen of this County, led by
the Prince their Captain; and some of the House of Commons, with the 800. of
the Trained Bands as a foot Guard, appeared this day on Heworth Moore; where
(in the judgment of most) were between 60. and 70. thousand Freeholders and
others. After his Majesty had rid about the field, He declared that that which
he had to say to them, he had put in Print, and so dispersed the same through
the field.

At the delivery thereof, diverse of the Cavelliers and others shaked their Hats
over their heads, and the people cried, God bless the King, God unite the King
and Parliament, and God turn the Kings heart, and with this they followed the
King from the Moore to the City. But by the way, let me advertise you of some
passages upon the Moore: Sir John Bourchier being among the Freeholders, and
reading a Petition, openly in the field for their approbation, to be presented
in the Name of the County to His Majesty, thereby declaring their dislike,
that those Cavelliers should be so near the Court, as if they were kept for
some design: And desiring the King to comply with the Parliament, and to
dismiss them. The Lo: Savill having notice thereof, came in a furious manner to
Sir Jo. Bourchier, saying, Sirrah, what Pamphlet are you reading there; who
answered, no Pamphlet, but that thing which he could justify. What is it some
seditious Petition? I command you to deliver it; which he refusing, the Lord
Savill was ready to take him by the Throat, and laying his hand upon his
Sword, threatened what he would do to him if he did not deliver it; whereupon
the Freeholders who approved of the same, were earnest to lay violent hands on
his Lordship; but Sir John Bourchier desirous to avoid shedding of Blood (which
unavoydably would have followed) delivered the same; the Freeholders were so
keen to be revenged on his Lordship for affronting them in hindering their
Petitioning to his Majesty, that they presently caused another Copy of the
same to be read openly in the Field, which receiving a general approbation,
none opposing it publicly, but one Bradley a Parson, Popish, and of a vicious
conversation: They requested Sir Thomas Fairefaxe Knight, son to Fardinando
Lord Fairefaxe, to present the same Petition to his Majesty; publicly
declaring their approbation thereunto: which he (notwithstanding the Lord
Savills opposition) accepted of, and used his utmost endeavor to deliver the
same, and after extraordinary opposition, made his way thorough the Horse, and
came at last near to his Majesty, and alighted, and tendered the same: who
putting it aside with his hand, declined the acceptance thereof; and Sir Thomas
Fairfaxe pressing the second time with more earnestness, received the like
refusal, yet left the same upon the Pummell of his Majesty's Saddle; and
returned and acquainted the Freeholders therewith; who being troubled at his
Majesty's refusal, resolved to go into the City, and as many of them whose
habitations were near York and could make stay, went and subscribed the
Petition; and after gave directions to present the same to the Parliament;
together with a short Petition to both Houses, showing the affronts they
received by the Lord Savill and the Lord Lindsey, who tore one of the
Petitions, which I should have mentioned before.

The Cavilliers reported by reason of the acclamation of the people, they were
wholly for the King, against the Parliament; which the people hearing of,
declared, they did not come that day with any intentions or resolutions to
divide the King and Parliament, nor would they ever condescend thereunto; and
were resolved of that answer in case any such propositions had been made: And
because there was an appearance of so many thousands, and nothing propounded to
require their answer, they went away much unsatisfied and discontent, because
they knew not wherefore they were summoned.

The Lord Savill who had endeavored to suppress the general Petition of the
County, has since the dismission of the assembly (being afraid of a public
Test) in an obscure manner, procured hands to another Petition to the
Parliament of a very strange Nature, and has procured the same to be Printed,
and to be dispersed through this County; and Benson an Attorney at Common Law
is designed by his Lordship to be employed in the West Riding, to progge for
h^nds to that Petition.

Let me a little trespass upon your patience, and acquaint you with other
Particulars. This morning the Lord Newcastle is come, and this night the Lord
Strange is expected, there are here about 42. peers of the Realm, and as many
of the House of Commons. And let me tell you what I hear, that a Declaration
is intended by the King and Lords (if not by the Commons here present) against
the proceedings of Parliament; what effect it will have I know not: by the next
Post perhaps you will hear the Chapter House or Deanery is making fit with
seats for Consultation, much after the manner of the house of Commons; Master
Hide is expected this night; Two Cart loades of Records and Books are come
down: Master Holborne and Master Chadwell are every day looked for.

York is a Sanctuary to all those that despise the Parliament; The Cavilliers
take liberty in railing against the Parliament, and use all means to put
affronts upon them, and to disaffect the people from them; for one Master King
being employed by the Sergeant at arms of the house of Commons, for the
apprehending of one Beckwith an Arch Papist, who was the principal actor in
the plot for surprise of Hull, having apprehended him, was rescued by 12.
Cavilliers, who beat Master King, and kicked him down the stairs, which the
Committee at York having notice of, Sir Ph. Stapleton, and Sir Hen. Cholmley
went into the room where they were, and demanded the prisoner, declaring
withal, they would have justice done upon them for this affront to the
Parliament, and at last, obtained their Prisoner again, whereupon the
Cavilliers went to Court, and a Command came from his Majesty for the
releasement of the prisoner, and the Messenger of the house of Commons was sent
for by Sir James Hay, and some of the Kings Guard, and for eight hours was
under restraint of a Guard of Musketeers, and was sent for to his Majesty, who
required him to show his Warrant, which he did, and his Majesty declared that
he would protect Beckwith: And the day after Beckwith took the oath of
Allegiance and Supremacy, as most of the greatest Papists in Yorkshire at
this time do; and (as is conceived) throughout the Kingdom they have a
dispensation to do, thereby the better to compass their designs; which are,
as our Cavilliers publicly declare here, to destroy the Parliament, for that
so long as the Act shall stand, that this Parliament shall not be dissolved
without consent of both Houses: It will be such a curb and bridle to all
desirous to mount Prerogative, that they will have no hopes of recovery, but by
destruction of this Parliament; which (if compassed) I fear will put a period
to all Parliaments, and so by consequence destroy our Religion, Liberty, and
Property: We much marvel that no notice is taken of the many Lords of the
House of Peers, and members of the house of Commons that are come down
hither, and that they are not summoned up, for it is given out here, there are
but about 56. in the house of Commons left, and about 20. of the Lords; And
that the rest have deserted the Parliament, and this they brag on in a high
manner: Now sure if it be suffered that Members of either House may be enjoined
by a VVarrant under his Majesty's hand, to attend his Majesty so far remote
from Parliament, and neglect the great affairs of the Kingdom, whereunto they
were elected by Writ, let Law be no more our Rule, but Will, and bid farewell
to all Parliaments.

I have but two particulars more to add, to wit, that a Corporal of Sir John
Hothams (as I am informed) and some 30. Common Soldiers are come from Hull to
the King, but the reason of their coming from thence, was, that the Corporal
for his abusive carriages was to ride the Horse, as also some of the Common
Soldiers, who in resistance thereof expressed a mutinous behavior, whereof Sir
Jo. Hotham being thoroughly possessed, quit the Garrison of them.

In a word I conclude, the Committee of the Parliament here resident, were by
his Majesty confined to their lodgings this day, and command not to go into the
field: they answered to my Lo: of Newport, (who brought his Majesty's command)
that it was against the liberty of the Subject, against the Law of the Land,
and not a small breach of the Privileges of Parliament, that members thereof
(sent down to keep the peace of the Kingdom) and Freeholders of this County
should be so illegally imprisoned, at such a time; which the Freeholders did
much distaste: Nevertheless, the Committee would obey, except the occurrences
of the day should require their presence in obedience to the command of
Parliament, and then they answered, they must not deceive so great a trust
committed to them, etc.

The most remarkable passages of this Weeks proceedings.
THe Lords and Commons professing (next to the service of Almighty God) their
real desire of his Majesty's honor, and the prosperity of this Kingdom,
likewise expressing their sense of the distractions thereof, and the misery
thereby threatened to the same, (occasioned by persons disaffected to the true
Religion, his Majesty's honor, and the peace of the Nation) agreed upon
nineteen Propositions to be sent to his Majesty, whereto they humbly
beseeched his Majesty's compliance, as to the most effectual means (through
Gods blessing) to prevent the enemies hopes, and our own fears, and to beget
a right understanding betwixt King and People, and declared to settle his
Majesty's revenew in a fuller manner than his predecessors ever inioyed.

It is Ordered that, the members of the House, of Commons gone to York, should
forthwith repair to the service of the Kingdom; in Parliament, and their
disobedience to the said Order should be deemed, a high affront to Parliament,
a failing of the trust reposed in them by the Kingdom, and a countenancing of
the war intended against the Parliament.

It is Ordered that all absent members of the Commons House should give speedy
attendance upon the business of the Common wealth, that all Sheriffs should
give notice of the said Order; and that if they be not in the House of Commons,
the 16. of this instant June, then each to forfeit a 100. pounds toward the
wars of Ireland, and to be further censured, Prout, etc.

Upon information that the Jewels of the Crown were either sold, or pawned
beyond Sea (which by the Law ought not to be alienated) and that the
extraordinary sums thereby raised, were probably to furnish the intended war
against the parliament: It is ordered by the Lords and Commons, that all Actors
about the same, not giving notice thereof to the parliament, shall be held
promoters of the said war, enemies to the State, and ought to satisfy the
public damage.

At a Common Hall in London the Loan of one hundred thousand pounds was
required by the Parliament from the City (for the affairs of England and
Ireland) which was granted with so general alacrity and readiness, that, (it
being desired, all against the Loan would hold up their hands) there was not a
hand lift up throughout the Hall, except one who began to speak, as was
conceived, against the same, whereupon he was imediatly hissed into shame and
silence; Upon the report of this faithfulness and affection of the City to
the Kingdom, both Houses resolved that an especial thanks should be drawn up
and sent unto them.

It is informed to the Parliament that above an hundred fail of Ships of the
Denmarkes are put to Sea, with many thousand Foot, and very many Horse, their
voyage is pretended to France for Salt, but it is well known, that Light
Horses do not use to carry Salt by Sea.

The Committee of the House of Commons (now in Lincoln shiere) to settle the
Militia, sent a Letter to the House, thereby showing the ready obedience they
there met withal (even beyond their expectation) unto the ordinance of
Parliament in that behalf: That the County has fourscore High Constables,
whereof all appeared before them (to render their account of the Armies and
munition of the County) except two or three (one of which was then at London)
so as the appearance was observed to be fuller then had been upon any
occasion heretofore; and that (notwithstanding his Majesty's Proclamation
against the Militia fixed upon the gate where they met, also his Majesty's
Letter sent to the old Deputy Lievtenants under the Lord Lindsey, who has a
new Commission under the Great Seal for the Lievtenancy of that county) the
Trained Bands of the City of Lincoln with a like number of Volunteers
completely armed, made tender of their service according to their late
Protestation.

A Petition was delivered to the Parliament from the County of York directed
to both Houses: and therewith they sent the Petition tendered to his Majesty
by them upon Friday last.
