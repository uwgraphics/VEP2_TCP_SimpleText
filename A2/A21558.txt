takers have of late excessyuely frequented the said marketes, and thereby given

decay of scholars, which also daily in this great derth, is like to encresse
and be more lamentable, to the hinderaunce of gods service, the dishonor of the
realm, the discomforte of all good and holy men, loving learning and virtue.
