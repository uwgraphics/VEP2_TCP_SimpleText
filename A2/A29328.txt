LONDON: Printed by T. J. for H. E. 1679.

An HYMN to the Lord JESUS CHRIST, the Savior of the World, humbly dedicated
by the Author.
1.
GReat Prince of Peace, who from thy Fathers Throne
Were pleased to descend, to save thine own,
Whom thou before all Ages had fore-known.
2.
And when the fullness of that time was come,
Did not abhor the Blessed Virgins Womb;
To save fallen Man from his Eternal Doom.
3.
Thou did accept a mean Estate, that we
Might be enriched by thy Poverty:
And by thy Miseries might happy be.
4.
To suffer Death, Lord thou did condescend,
Thou took'st the pain and shame, and to this end
Thou conquered'st Death, that it might be our Friend.
5.
Death, which of old of Terrors was the King,
Now vanquished by thee has lost its Sting;
And can no other than glad Tidings bring.
6.
Tidings of Joy, our Summons to the Dust,
In a most firm Assurance that we must
Rise when thou comm'st to glorify the Just.
7.
The Trumpet's sound shall then all Mortals raise,
Who on thy Splendour shall with wonder gaze:
And with loud Clamors echo forth thy Praise.
8.
Then will thou sit on Clouds enthroned on high,
Shining with Glory, clothed with Majesty.
Whilst Earth and Hell in scorching Flames shall ly.
9.
Hard-hearted sinners then for mercy shall
Entreat and beg in vain, and loudly call
For lofty Mountains on their Heads to fall.
10.
Whilst on the other hand thy Chosen Sheep
An Everlasting Jubilee shall keep.
And Endless Joys in thy blessed Kingdom reap.
11.
There, fixed in a never-changing State,
Their pure and heavenly Joys shall never abate:
And Time shall then for ever want a date.
12.
Thither, dear Lord, vouchsafe, us all to bring;
That amongst the Quire of Angels we may sing
Eternal Praise to thee our God and King.
H. E.

The History of the Birth, Life, Sufferings, and Death of our Blessed Savior
Jesus Christ.
I.
THe God above abound in love
from all Eternity, Ephesians. 2.4. Romans 8.29.

Unto all those whom he has chose
to save from misery.
II.
His love was dear, Ephesians. 14.
it does appear
he chose them in his Son;
That they might be by him made free
who were by sin undone. John 8.38.

III.
True Lord, we were all made by thee, Genesis 1.26, 27. Eccl. 7.29.

and formed thy Image in:
We did possess true Holiness,
perfect without all sin.
IV.
But thou did see, what we would be
from all Eternity;
That we would turn, Eccl. 7.29. Hose. 13.9.
and from thee run
into all misery.
V.
Thou did therefore, Pr. 8.22, 23. 1 Pet. 1.20. Rev. 13.8. Ephesians. 2.23.
long time before
that we our being had,
Set thy Son apart, that he might smart
for us who were most bad.
VI.
This love was in thy heart, even when
from all Eternity
Thou did design some to be thine, Rev. 17.8. Acts 13.48.

To save eternally.
VII.
Thou gave them, Joh. 17.69. Ephesians. 1.4 Joh. 17.12. Joh. 6.39.
even unto him,
in whom thou did them choose;
That he might have, them for to save,
and none of them might lose.
VIII.
When Offerings, Heb. 10.1, 4.
and all such things,
could never take away
The sins of those, whom thou had chose;
when from thee gone astray. 1 Pet. 2.25.

IX.
Thou did prepare, for Christ most dear,
a Body to come in; Heb. 10.5. Romans 8.

That he might be, like unto we,
who were all under sin.
X.
Though he was not, Heb. 7.26. 1 Cor. 5.21.
no not one jot,
defiled with sin within;
But did appear, our guilt to bear, Isa. 53.5, 6.

who were all full of sin.
XI.
O wonderment, to 'stonishment,
what mystery is this?
Our Lord and Savior, who was the Father, Romans 9.5.

even of eternal bliss.
XII.
That he should be, yea, even that he, Col. 1.15, 16. Gal. 4.4.

who was the Woman's Maker;
That he should ever be made of her,
and yet was her Creator.
XIII.
He that abode, the mighty God, Isa. 9.6.

became a little Child;
Yea, he was born, and was the scorn, Heb. 1.3.13.8.

of those who were defiled.
XIV.
His Birth was low, therefore we know,
but few did him esteem; Luke 2.7. Mat. 2.11.

But yet there were, that did appear,
and worship did to him.
XV.
This Child did grow, Luke 2.40. John 7.5. Mat. 6.3. John 8.59.
but few did know
He was the Son of God;
He under-went great punishment,
even by the wicked's rod.
XVI.
He was anointed, Prove. 8.23. Isa. 61.1. Heb. 3.2. 1 Timothy 2.5.
and appointed,
of God his heavenly Father;
That he might be, 'teen God and we,
Eternal Mediator.
XVII.
Thus he abode, Heb. 13.8. Acts 10.38. Luke 19.10. Luke 24.32.
and unto God
his Office did perform;
He went about, sought sinners out,
That he their hearts might warm.
XVIII.
And his kindness, and tenderness
unto poor men was great;
He dispossessed the poor distressed, Mat. 8.16.

and Devils did defeat.
XIX.
When he such found, Luke 13.16. Mark 1.25, 26. Mat. 9.33.
as were thus bound,
and fettered with Chains;
The Chains did break, the Dumb did speak,
he freed Men from all Pains.
XX.
He was so kind unto the blind,
he did restore their sight; John 9.6, 7.

The Lame that lay along his way,
he put them in good plight. Mat. 11.5.

XXI.
The Blind, the Sick, and Lunatic,
he healed each of them
Of all Disease, he gave all ease, Mark 7.35, 37. John 11.44.

whoever came to him.
XXII.
The Deaf did hear, as did appear,
for he their hearing gave;
Some that were dead, he quickened,
and raised out o'th grave.
XXIII.
All this and more, for to the poor,
he did the Gospel preach; Mat. 11.5. Mat. 4.23.

About he went, as he was sent,
the way to Heaven to teach.
XXIV.
And then his Name and mighty Fame
began to spread abroad, Mat. 4.24. Mat. 9.31, 33. Joh. 6.15.7.46.

And many men were taken then
with this our dearest Lord.
XXV.
Many there were, that thought it clear,
he was the Son of God; John 12.42, 43.

But dur'st not this of him confess,
they feared the wickeds rod.
XXVI.
But some the while did him revile,
and spoke most dreadful evil;
And thought it well, thus to rebel,
and say he had a Devil.
XXVII.
What sad abuse, from the profuse,
did this Lord meet withal;
How few were there, John 6.66, 68.
that did appear
to speak one word at all.
XXVIII.
On his behalf; no not one half,
of all that did him hear:
That were so stout to stand it out,
his innocence to clear.
XXIX.
But he did not, retort one jot,
nor Men revile again; 1 Pet. 2.22, 23, 24.

But patiently, he past it by,
went on his work amain.
XXX.
'Twas his delight, Psalm. 40.8. Luke 6.12, 13. John 4.34.
both day and night,
to do his Fathers will;
And what was this, but Men to bliss,
and save them out of Hell.
XXXI.
This Son of God, did do much good,
but was rewarded evil, John 10.12.8.44.

Men him abused, falsely accused,
and acted like the Devil.
XXXII.
But none of those, John 7.45, 46.
that were his foes,
could over him have power;
By men's commands, to lay their hands, Mat. 26.55.

till his accomplished hour.
XXXIII.
Then one of twelve, he proved a Wolve, Mat. 8.14, 15. Act. 1.25.

did not his place abide;
He went and told, and Jesus sold,
and to his foes was guide.
XXXIV.
Yea, one of them, that were with him,
went and did him betray; Mat. 26.48.

He did them show, and told them how,
on him their hands to lay.
XXXV.
Then came the hour, yea, and the power.
the pangs of Death and Hell; Luke 2.55. Mat. 26.37.

Oh! who does know, so as to show,
who can his sorrows tell?
XXXVI.
The sins of those, whom God had chose, Isa. 53.6. 2 Cor. 5.21.

who were chosen in him;
Were laid upon this only Son,
He bore the sins of them.
XXXVII.
And it was they, that made him pray,
they were of such a weight; Mat. 26.39. Heb. 5.7.

They made him cry, and send on high,
he was in such a strait.
XXXVIII.
What drops of blood, this Son of God,
did sweat upon the ground; Luke 22.44. John 8.34, 36.

And all that he, might set such free,
who were by sin fast bound.
XXXIX.
Then came again, Judas amain,
with all his cursed crew, Mat. 26.47.

Who went most strong, and he among,
that he his Lord might show.
XL.
The way was fine, he gave a sign:
what was the sign but this,
He hail did say, Mat. 26.48.
and did betray
him, with a wicked kiss.
XLI.
This Companies authority,
they had from Hypocrites; Mat. 26.47. John 18.3.

Thought they were strong, Judas among,
and on they came with lights.
XLII.
But 'lass, poor men, if Christ had then
unto his Father prayed,
How soon he might, Mat. 26.53.
even that same night,
Angels have had for aid.
XLIII.
But this was done, on God the Son,
the Scriptures to fulfill; Mat. 26.56.

That none of those, that God had chose, Mat. 26.56.

might suffer Death or Hell.
XLIV.
Behold how all, whom Christ did call,
Disciples for to be,
Away did make, and him forsake, Mat. 26.56.

when they began to see.
XLV.
Their Lord was took; they him forsook
when their Shepherd was smitten
The Sheep did flee away from he, Zach. 13.7.

for fear they should be bitten.
XLVI.
When these were fled, away they led
the Lord unto the Prison; Mat. 26.56, 57. Isa. 53.8.

And many they are, that did appear,
against him now we are risen.
XLVII.
O what a rout, was there about
this dear and precious Lord; Luke 23.1, 2, 11, 65.

They did abuse, and him accuse
of things which he abhorred.
XLVIII.
This wicked rout, they were so stout,
more liker beasts than men.
These barking dogs, Psalm. 22.12, 16.
did cast their bogs
even at the Lord of Heaven.
XLIX.
The Bulls did gore, Psalm. 22.12, 13. Mat. 26.67.
and Lions roar,
as is said in the Psalm;
Yea these were those most dreadful foes,
that smote him with the Palm.
L.
These men were they, as Scripture say,
that did spit on his face;
That did him strip, and also whip;
these men were they so base.
LI.
Observe this thing; Luke 23.1, 7.
they led this King
before poor earthly men,
Who, before had been, even until then,
at enmity; but when
LII.
This they did see, they did agree
against this blessed Lord:
That so they might thus vend their spite, Luke 23.8.

and to the Jews afford
LIII.
What help they could; so much as would
dispatch him out o'th way.
The Jews pretend they had good end,
and therefore they did say,
LIVE.
We have a Law, and by this Law,
this Man he ought to die, Joh. 19.7.

But they were false, Witnesses false; Mat. 26.60.

and did most falsely lie:
LV.
For Pilate then, the worst of men,
did then most clearly see,
They vehemently, out of envy, Mat. 27.18.

did this, that Christ might die.
LVI.
Therefore he would, if Water could,
his guilt have washed away.
But Blood was spilt, Mat. 24.24.
therefore the guilt
it still on him did stay.
LVII.
His sin and stain, do still remain;
they stand upon Record:
It Is charged on him, Mar. 15.15.
amongst all them
that crucified their Lord.
LVIII.
But now let us, consider thus,
What did become of him,
Who had Christ sold, the Money told,
he that was Guide to them
LIX.
Who did all this sad wickedness?
this Wretch did now repent,
And brought again the price with pain, Mat. 27.3.

but was not penitent.
LX.
He then into despair did go,
where he began to sink;
And then how he should freed be,
too late began to think.
LXI.
From his sad pain, which came amain,
he then his Life dispatched; Mat. 27.5. Act. 1.18.

But headlong fell, he into Hell,
his Soul the Devil caught.
LXII.
Let Hypocrites, false hearted Wights,
seriously on this think,
And warning take, by this that make
Judas his Name to stink.
LXIII.
Now turn to those, his other foes,
who did him set at naught;
And take a view as Scriptures show, Luke 23.11.

of them who had Christ bought.
LXIV.
The Soldiers then, those wretched men,
this precious Lord did take
Into the Hall, Mat. 27.27, 28, 29.
common for all,
at him their sport to make.
LXV.
They stripped him, and put on him
a Scarlet Robe, and when
They Would made a Crown ('it was made of thorn.)
and on him they put it then.
LXVI.
And mockingly and scoffingly,
they then did bow the knee;
O wicked thing, they mocked this King,
Who yet their Judge must be.
LXVII.
Yea, him they smote, but he did not
at all resist again,
But patiently he past it by, Isa. 53.7.

And under-went his pain.
LXVIII.
And then they led him to be bled,
unto a place most vile;
A place of Scull, Mat. 27.33.
some think 'twas full
of dead men's bones the while.
LXIX.
They stripped him, and hanged him,
there up upon the Cross;
They parted then his Garments, Mat. 27.35.
when
this Lord did suffer loss.
LXX.
^ehold what shame, yea, and what blame
they then did cast on him;
^was numbered then, with wicked men, Mat. 27.38.

they numbered him with them.
LXXI.
They pierced his Hands at men's commands,
yea, and his Feet did they
Nail to the Tree, Psalm. 22.16.
some it did see,
that so they might him slay.
LXXII.
These men they mocked, and also scoft
at him, they did deride;
Some were so mad, Mat. 27.39. John 19.34.
their Heads they waged,
one pierced his precious side.
LXXIII.
This being done, let us now look on,
into the inward side;
For to espy the Mystery
let us not here abide.
LXXIV.
Let us not lay too much on they
who crucified him thus;
But let us enlarge this dreadful charge,
and bring it home to us.
LXXV.
Our sins were they, our sins we say,
that on this Lord did lie;
Yea, they were they, that did him slay,
that did him crucify.
LXXVI.
Our sins we say; yea they were they,
which were the Crown of Thorns; Isa. 53.5, 6.

The were they, Isa. 53.5, 6.
that bruised and him abused,
and caused most dreadful groans.
LXXVII.
They pierced his Side, the Wound was wide,
so as the Blood did run,
For us his foes; for we were those,
who were by sin undone.
LXXVIII.
Sinners against thee, O Lord were we,
most filthy in thy sight,
And must have lain, even under pain,
in dreadful hellish plight.
LXXIX.
For Lord it is clear, by sin we were,
in wretched helpless case; Psalm. 89.19. 2 Cor. 5.21.

We had no aid, but help was laid,
on Christ to give us ease.
LXXX.
We must have sank, had not he drank,
that sour bitter Cup;
That bitter Gall, we that did fall, Mat. 26.42.

should have no more got up.
LXXXI.
But thou, Oh Lord, did Grace afford;
thou did thy favor lend,
To take away our gulilt that lay,
thus did thou condescend.
LXXXII.
To lay't upon thy only Son, 2 Cor. 5.21.

thy only Son most dear,
That we might be from sin made free,
and he our guilt might bear.
LXXXIII.
That he might die to satisfy,
the justice of our God,
That so poor we, might freed be,
from sins eternal rod.
LXXXIV.
We were unlike, and had dislike,
Lord of thy Majesty;
Within our hearts and inward parts, Romans 8.7.

was dreadful enmity.
LXXXV.
So that we would not, no, nor could
have turned unto thee;
But Christ did lay, his Life to stay
this enmity that we,
LXXXVI.
Who were unjust; but Christ most just
did feel the smarting rod,
Which made him cry, 1 Pet. 3.18.
yea, and did die
to bring us unto God.
LXXXVII.
O blessed sight, which shine most bright,
To see a broken Savior;
Who paid his blood, even unto God,
to bring us into favor.
LXXXVIII.
We that by sin, which dwells within,
most dreadfully did stink;
And must have lain, in Hell with pain, Psalm. 38.3.

we were upon its brink.
LXXXIX.
But Christ that Box, that Spikenard Box,
did break, and its perfume
Did send on high, above the Sky, Mar. 14.3.

our stink for to consume.
XC.
This Odor then, it filled Heaven
with such a fragant smell,
As never did ascend to God, Ephesians. 5.2.

that pleased him so well.
XCI.
And Earth below, some it does know,
it was perfumed so well,
That scent did draw from Satan's Law,
'twas such attractive smell.
XCII.
And they that know, will tell us now,
it is the best perfume
That ever we did smell or see,
its virtue never consume.
XCIII.
No, though it is long, since that among
poor men this Box did break;
It Is sweet remains, and many gain,
yea, still it Saints does make.
XCIV.
And some of all, both great and small,
of sinners that were chief;
It has perfumed, 1 Timothy 1.15. Luke 23.43.
their lusts consumed;
of which one was the chief.
XCV.
And all that dwell on earth, and smell
the sweetness of this savor,
It makes alive, their souls, and thrive;
it brings them into favor.
XCVI.
O taste and see, Christ on the tree,
oh soul, and do not starve;
Though all be spent, Christ he was sent,
and he his flesh did carve.
XCVII.
Which to the dead is meat indeed, John 6.50. to 59.

his blood is also drink,
To those that eat his flesh for meat,
and of his blood do drink.
XCVIII.
This bread is good, it is that of God
which down from heaven did come:
And all that eat the same for meat;
in heaven shall have a room.
XCIX.
And shall not die eternally,
but live with Christ for aye;
Dwelling in him, and he in them,
and never die away.
C.
Oh take a view, as Scripture show
of Jesus on the Cross,
How he did bleed; we might be freed
from everlasting loss.
CI.
The Case was this, the Lord of Bliss
for sinners was oppressed!
Which made him cry amazingly, Mat. 27.50.

and yielded up the Ghost.
CII.
O Mystery, that Christ should die,
he was the Lord of life,
But subject was, through death did pass,
for his dear Spouse, his Wife.
CIII.
What Is all this done, O hearts of Stone,
that we cannot relent,
Oh senseless blocks, look to the rocks,
which at this thing were rent. Mat. 27.51.

CIV.
Christ's blood did gush, the heavens did blush.
yea and the earth did quake;
The Sun withdrew his light from view, Mar. 15.33.

what work this thing did make.
CV.
'Twas not for they; but us, we say
that this our Lord did die:
Oh let us relent now, Heb. 5.7.
and repent,
of that which made him cry.
CVI.
All this was done, on God the Son,
the Scriptures to fulfill;
But nothing more, John 19.36.
than what before
was written as God's will.
CVII.
And two great men, appeared then,
their loves to Christ to show;
Who then was dead: 'Twas love indeed,
of which let us take a view.
CVIII.
The one, behold, he was so bold,
his courage was so brave,
He went unto Pilate, that so
Christ's Body he might crave.
CIX.
He Linen bought, John 19.39.
the other brought
in weight an hundred pound
Of sweet Perfume; it to perfume,
and it in Linen wound.
CX.
A Tomb was hewn, they laid him down,
to show that he was dead;
To show that sin was buried in Mar. 15.46.

that grave in very deed.
CXI.
Death to consume, our Graves perfume,
and sweeten them for us;
Thus Christ our aid, in Grave was laid,
and him they buried thus.
CXII.
And now behold, the Jews most bold,
while in the Grave he lay,
Yea come and look, what pains they took,
even on the Sabbath Day.
CXIII.
When this was done, they sealed the Stone, Mat. 27.62. to end.

and set a Watch thereby;
This Sacrifice he might not rise,
but in Sepulcher lie.
CXIV.
But when he had lain under the pain
of Death the appointed hour;
The Angels then, came down from heaven,
the Watchmen had no power.
CXV.
The Earth did quake, those men did shake,
when Angels did appear;
Those men they did become as dead,
the were overcome with fear.
CXVI.
The Angels then, that came from Heaven,
did roll away the stone;
He that was dead, was quickened,
for then his work was done.
CXVII.
Yea up he rose, in spite of foes
and came forth out the grave;
He loosed its pain, Acts 2.24.
and rose again,
that he might victory have.
CXVIII.
He Victory has now over Death,
and over Sin and Hell.
For some of those, who were his foes,
who here on Earth do dwell.
CXIX.
And it is clear, he did appear
to be the Son of God;
And that with power, Romans 1.4.
in that same hour,
he not in grave abode.
CXX.
And many they, the Saints that lay
in Graves until that hour;
Their bodies rose, in spite of foes; Mat. 27.52, 53.

and that by Christ his power.
CXXI.
^hen Death its strength, yea, and its sting,
was broke and took away,
^ully for those, whom God has chose, 1 Cor. 15.55, 56, 57.

though here in graves they lay.
CXXII.
^ll they shall rise, and then shall prize
their Resurrection from
Their Graves; for then, Phil. 3.21.
they are for heaven
in likeness of Christ's form.
CXXIII.
that Jesus Christ, our great High Priest,
did rise, is very clear;
^or this behold, Mat. 18.6.
the Angels told
the Women that were there.
CXXIV.
^t came to pass, that of Cephas,
then of the Twelve was seen:
Yea he alive of Hundreds five 1 Cor. 15.5, 6.

at once then was he seen.
CXXV.
^hen James and all, both great and small, 1 Cor. 15.57. John 21.27, 28.

th 'Apostles did him see,
Yea Thomas knew, when Christ did show
his wounds, that it was h.
CXXVI.
In forty days he showed his ways,
To his he gave commands,
How for to steer, Act. 1.3, 4.
his Kingdom here,
then lifting up his Hands,
CXXVII.
He them did bliss, and promised this,
that to them he would send Luke 24.49, 50.

The Comforter; to his Father
he strait-way did ascend.
CXXVIII.
Then Christ alive, did lead captive
his Enemies and Foes;
He victory have, Ephesians. 4.8.
and gifts he gave,
to them whom he had chose,
CXXIX.
He now possess Glory and Bliss,
the Fathers right Hand by; Heb. 10.12. chap. 6.20.

His gone before to open the door,
for those whom he did die.
CXXX.
He now prepare, John 14.3. Chap. 17.24. 1 These. 4,17. 1 Cor. 13.12.
for his most dear,
in Heaven, a glorious place,
Where they shall be from sin set free,
and see his glorious Face.
CXXXI.
He that was dead, is quickened,
and lives for evermore;
The Keys he has of Hell and Death, Rev. 1.18.

he ever lives therefore.
CXXXII.
To plead for those, whom he has chose,
the virtue of his Blood,
Does for them plead and intercede, Heb. 7.25.

there with the mighty God.
CXXXIII.
Christ able is to save all his;
They Are ever in his Hands:
He ever live, and answers give, Joh. 10.28.

to Justice its demands.
CXXXIV.
He does appear for his most dear, Heb. 10.12, 13. Acts 3.20, 21. Luke 21.27.

their cause for to maintain,
Against all those who are their foes;
in Heaven he does remain.
CXXXV.
He there reside, and shall abide
till the appointed hour,
And then again he comes amain,
with glory and with power.
CXXXVI.
With Angels strong, and Saints among,
his Spouse he will then embrace, Mat. 25.31.

And will complete that marriage great,
which is begun through Grace. Rev. 19.7, 8.

CXXXVII.
O happy they, Rev. 19.9. 1 These. 4.16.
that keep his way,
and ready shall be found;
They shall have Life and be his Wife,
when that the Trumpet sound.
CXXXVIII.
They shall rejoice, the Bridegrooms voice
will make their hearts to cheer;
They shall be glad, yea, and be clad,
with Garments cost him dear.
CXXXIX.
Then all mourning, in that morning
