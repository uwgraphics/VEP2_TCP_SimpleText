By the King.
A Proclamation for the explaining of a former Proclamation lately published,
entitled a Proclamation prohibiting the importation of any goods or
merchandise whatsoever, in any French Ships or Bottomes.
WHereas by the advice of Our Privy Council We declared Our Royal pleasure by
our Proclamation bearing date the eight and twentieth day of April now last
past, that no goods, merchandise or commodities whatsoever; of what condition
or nature soever, should at any time, or times, then after be brought or
unported into any of our Realms or Dominions, or any Haven, Port, or Creek of
the same in any Ship, Bottom, or Vessel of or belonging to the French King:
or any his Subjects, until Our pleasure should be further published and made
known to the contrary: upon such pains and penalties as in and by the said
Proclamation are contained and expressed, as by the said Proclamation, it does
and may more at large appear.

Now least there should be any evasion used, to frustrate the intention of the
said Proclamation, and of Our Royal pleasure and commannd thereby declared, or
any ambiguity in the true understanding thereof, We do hereby, by the like
advise of Our Privy Counsel, will and command, and declare Our Royal pleasure
to be; That all goods and merchandise whatsoever, of what condition or nature
soever, which at any time hereafter, (until Our will and pleasure shall be
published to the contrary) shall be found or taken, in any Port, Haven, or
Creek, or upon the Sea or any River, in any Ship, Bottom, or vessel; of or
belonging to the French King or any of his Subjects directly, or indirectly, to
whomsoever the said goods or merchandise do or shall belong, shall be
forfeited and confiscated unto Us: and as forfeited and confiscate, shall be
seized to Our use.

Nevertheless, Our will and pleasure is that if any such Ship, Bottom, or
Vessel be taken or seized as prize by any of Our Subjects, or others by virtue
of Letters of Marque, obtained from Us, or Our Admiral of England, that in
such cases the goods and merchandise which shall be found and taken in every such
Ship, Bottom, or Vessel, shall be of the same condition to all intents, and
purposes, and as lawful prize, as the Ship, Bottom, or Vessel in which
they are found and taken ought to be, as if this Proclamation, had not been
made; of which our Royal pleasure, all Our Officers and loving Subjects, and
all others whom it may, or shall concern, are to take notice at their perils.

Given at Our Court at White Hall the twelfth day of May in the third year of
Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.

excellent Majesty. M.D.C.XXVII.
