Right as the stern of day begouth to schyne
Quhen gone to bed war vesper and lucyne
I raise and by a rosere did me rest
Wp sprang the goldyn candill matutyne
With clear depurit bemes cristallyne
Glading the merry foulis in their nest
Or phoebus was in purpur cape reuest
Wp raise the lark the hevyns menstrale fine
In may / in till a morrow myrthfullest
Full angellike their birdis sang their houris
Within their courtyns grene in to their houris.
Apparalit quhite and read with blomes suete
Anamalit was the field with all colouris
The perly droppis schake in silvir schouris.
Quhill all in balm did branch and leuis flete
To part fra phoebus did aurora great
Her cristall teris I saw hyng on the flouris
Quhilk he for lufe all drank up with his hete
For mirth of may with skippis and with happis.
The birdis sang upon the tender croppis
With curiouse note as venus chapel clerkis
The rosis young new spreding of their knopis
War powdit bryt with hevinly beriall droppis
Throu bemes read birnyng as ruby sperkis.
The skies rang for schoutyng of the larkis
The purpur hevyn our scailit in silvir sloppis
Our gilt the treis branchis lef^ barkis
Doun^ throu the ryce a ryuir ran with stremys
So lustily again thai lykand lemys
That all the lake as lamp did leme of licht
Quhilk schadovit all about wyht twynkling glemis
That bewis bathit war in secund bemys
Throu the reflex of phoebus visage bryt
On every side the hegies raise on hicht
The bank was grene / the bruke vas full of bremys
The sta^neris clear as stern in frosty nyt
The cristall air the sapher firmament
The ruby skies of the orient
kest beriall bemes on emeraut bewis grene
The rosy garth depaynt and redolent
With purpur azure gold and goulis gent
Arrayed was* by dame ^^lora the queen
So nobily* that joy was for to seen
The roch again the riwir resplendent
As low enlumynit / all the leaves schene
Quhat throu the merry foulys armony
And throu the ryueris soun^ ryt ran me by
On fflorais mantill I slepit as I lay
Quhare sone in to my dremes fantasy
I saw approach again the orient sky
I saill als quhite as blossum upon spray
With merse of gold bryt as the stern of day
Quhilk tendit to the land full lustily
As falcoun^ swift desyrouse of her pray
And hard on burd unto the blomyt medis
Amang the grene rispis and the redis
Arrivit sche quhar fro anon^ their landis.
Ane hundredth ladies lusty in to wedis.
Als fresch as flouris that in may up spredis
In kirtillis grene with outyn kell or bandis
Their bry^ hairis hang gleting on the strandis
In tressis clear wyppit with goldyn thredis
With pappis quhite / and mydlis small as wandis
Distrine I wald bot quho could well endyte
How all the feldis with thai lilies quhite
Depaynt war bry^ ye quhilk to the hevyn did glete
Noucht thou omer als fair as thou coud write
For all thine ornate stilis so perfyte
Nor yet thou Tullius / quho is lippis suete.

With variand luke ryt like a lord unstable.

And ewiry one of their in grene arayit.
On harp or lute full merrily thai playit
And sang ballettis with michty notis clear
Ladies to dance full sobirly assayit

Go me arrest / and they no time delayit
Than ladies fair lets fall their mantillis gren
With lowis big in tressit hairis schene
All sudaynly they had a f^lde arayit
And yet ryt greatly was I noucht affrayit.

And schot quhill wastit was their artilye
Syne went abak reboytit of their pray
Quhen venus had persauit this rebute
Dissymilance scho bad go make persute
At all powere to perse the goldyn targe
And scho that was of doubilnes the rute
Askit her choice of archeris in refute
Wenus the best bad her go wale at large
Scho tuke presence plicht ankers of the barge
And fair calling that well a flayn coud schute
And cherising for to complete her charge
Dame hamelynes scho tuke in company
That hardy was and hende in archery
And broucht dame beautee to the field again
With all the choice of venus cheualry
They come and bikkerit vnabaisitly
The schour of arowis rappit on as rayn
Perilouse presence that money sire has slain
The bataill broucht on bordour hard us by
The salt was all the sarar suth to sayn
Thik was the schote of grundyn dartis kene
Bot reson^ with the scheld of gold so schene
Warly defendit quho so ewir assayes
The aufull stoure he manly did sustene
Quhilk presence keft a pulder in his ene
And than as dru^kyn man he all for vayit
Quhen he was blind the fule with him they playit
And banyst him amang the bewis grene
That sorry sicht me sudaynly affrayit
Than was I woundit to the death well nere
And yoldyn as a woeful prisonnere
To lady beautee in a moment space

After that resou^ tynt had his eyne clear
Than of before / and lufliare of face
Quhy was thou blyndit reson^. quhi allace
And gert ane hell. my paradise appear
And mercy seem / quhare that I fand no grace
Dissymulance was besy me to sile
And fair calling did often upon me smyle
And cherising me fed with wordis fair
New acquyntance enbracit me a quhile
And fauouryt me. quhill men my^ go a mile
Syne tuke her leve. I saw her nevir mare
Than saw I dangere toward me repair.
I coud eschew her presence be no wyle
On side scho lukit with ane fremyt fare
And at the last departing coud her dress
And me delyu^it unto hevynesse
For to remain / and scho in cure me take.
Be this the lord of wyndis with wodenes
God Eolus his bugill blew I guess
That with the blast the leuis all to schake
And sudaynly in the space of a luke
All was hyne went their was bot wildnes
Their was no more bot birdis bank and bruke
In twynklyng of ane eye to scip thai went
And swyth up sail unto the top thai stent
And with swift course atour the flude thai frak
Thai fyrit gu^nis with powd violent
Till that the reke raise to the firmament
The rochis all resownyt with the rak
For read it semyt that the rayn bow brak.
With spirit affrayde upon my fete I sprent
Amang the clewis so careful was the crak
And as I did awake of my sueving
The joyful birdis merrily did sing
For mirth of phoebus tend bemes schene
Suete war. the vapouris soft the morowing
Halesum the vale depaynt with flouris ying
The air attempit sobir and amene
In quhite and read was all the field besene
Throu naturis nobil fresch anamalyng
In mirthfull may of ewiry month queen
O reu^end Chaucere rose of rethoris all
As in our tongue and flour imperial
That raise in britane ewir quho redis ryt
Thou beris of makaris the triumph riall
Thy frech anamalit terms celicall
This mat coud illumynit have full bryt
Was thou noucth of our inglisch all the lyt
Surmounting ewiry tongue terrestrial
Alls fer as mayes morrow dois mydnycht.
O moral Gower / and ludgate laureate
your sugurit lippis and tongis aureate
Been to our eris cause of great delight
your angel mouthis most mellifluate
Our rude langage has clear illumynate
And fair our gilt our spech that unperfyte
Stude or your goldyn pe^nis schupe to wirte
This I Will before was bare and desolate
Off rethorike. or lusty fresch endyte
Thou lytill quair be ewir obedient
Humble subject and simple of intent
Before the fare of ewiry connyng wicht
I know quhat thou of rethorike may spent
Off all her lusty rosis redolent.
Is nou^ in to thy gerland set on hicht
Eschame thar of and draw the out of sicht
Rude is thy wede disteynit bare and rent
Well aucht thou be aferit of the licht
