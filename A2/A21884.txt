By the Queen.
A Proclamation to charge all persons that have gotten any manner goods into
their possession, which have been taken on the Seas this last year, and have
not been customed, to restore the same upon pain to be punished as Felons and
Pirates.
WHere of late by our Proclamation published in certain Counties on the Sea
coast Westward, strait commandment was given by us to all manner of persons,
that have bought or exchanged, or by any means received of any manner of
person, directly or indirectly out of the Fleet set forth this last Summer,
at the charge of the City of London, and lately returned any manner of
commodities from any person, without the consent of the owners of t(...) said
ships, that they should bring to certain Commissioners at Plymmouth,
Dertmou(...) Totnes, Exceter, Southampton, and Portesmouth, a particular note
in writing of the same, upon pain to be punished as felons and abbettors to
Pirates, if they should not within a time limited obey the same charge and
commandment, as more particularly is expressed in the said Proclamation. Now
her Majesty is informed, that there has been other notable deceipts used by
diverse other Captains, Masters and Mariners in sundry other ships, which
have served on the Seas this last Summer, for that many of them have contrary
to the laws broken bulk, and made spoil on the Seas, before the Ships and
the pryzes came to any Port, and have feloniously embeselled great quantities
of goods out of the said Ships, for which custom should have been paid to her
Majesty (which has not been) and out of which the owners and adventurers
should have had also their parts, according to the charge of their adventures,
who are also deprived of the value of such goods so embeselled, and the parties
that have so embeselled such goods, are in danger to answer thereto as felons
and pirates, and such as have bought and received any part thereof, in danger
to be punished as abbettors to pirates, if they shall deteyne and conceal the
same. Therefore to the enlarging of the said Proclamation, being only
directed to the Ports of the West Country, and for the discovery of the
goods taken by the Fleet of the City of London: her Majesty does now by
these presents generally charge and command all manner of persons in any part
of her Realm, that have had, bought, or received by gift, exchange, or by
delivery of any manner of goods that have been taken on the Seas this last
Summer by any Ship whatsoever, for the which, custom has not been duly
paid or compounded for with her Majesty's Officers of her Ports, that they
shall not after, alyen, or waste any part of such goods, but shall bring to the
head Officers of the custom houses, or other special Commissioners appointed
at the Ports, or nearest to the places where they bought or received the same
goods, a plain declaration in writing, signed with their hands or marks,
containing the particular names, quantities, and qualities of the said goods,
and shall thereby express names and conditions of the parties of whom they
received the same, and of the parcels which they received, and what they
delivered in value for the same. And if they have alyened or dispossessed
themselves of any part thereof, in such cases they shall also express in
writing, to whom they have so alyened or delivered the same. And if any person
shall not within twenty days space the publication hereof, observe this her
Majesty's commandment to all purposes, as before is specified, the same shall
be used and proceeded withal as felons and abbettors of pirates, according to
the laws of this Realm.

Given at our Palace of Westminster the eight day of January, in the four
and thirtieth year of our Reign.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Christopher Barker, Printer to the
Queens most excellent Majesty. 1591.
