LONDON Printed by R. B. for VV. Ferebrand, and are to be sold at his shop in
Popes head Alley, near unto the Royal Exchange. 1606,

To the very Worthy Gentleman, Sir John Hamden Knight.
SIR, the begetting of Books, is as common as the begetting of Children: only
herein they differ, that Books speak so soon as they come into the world,
and give the best words they ca^ to al men, yet are they driven to seek abroad
for a father. That hard fortune follows al and falls into, upon THIS of mine.
It gladly coms to you upon that errand, and if you vouchsafe to receive it
lovingly, I shall account my self and It, very happy. These Paper-monsters
are sure to beset upon, by many terrible encounters; They had need therefore
to get Armor of proof that may not shrink for a bullet; The strongest
shieldes that I know for such fights, are good Patrons; from whom writers
claim such ancient privileges, that how-soeuer they find entertainment, they
make bold to take acquaintance of them (though never so merely strangers)
without blushing: wherein they are like to courtiers, that inuit the^selus,
unbidden) to other men's tables and that is a most Gentleman-like, quality and
yet hold it a disgrace, if they receive not a complementall welcome. Custom
making that show handsomely, which (if the curious hand of Formality, should
apparel) would appear vile Fashion thereforeis the best Painter, for what
pictures soever she draws, are workman-ly done: presuming upon whose warrant, I
send unto you the discovery of a strange country, If it were of both Indyes, my
love could bestow it upon you. Accept it therefore, and if hereafter I may be a
voyager to any happyer coast, the Fruits of (that as now of this) shallbe most
affectionately consecrated to you.

From him that wishes he could be a deseruer of you.

Tho. Dekker

To the Reader.
TO come to the press is more dangerous, then to be pressed to death, for the
pain of those Tortures, last but a few minutes, but he that lies upon the rack
in print, has his flesh torn off by the teeth of Envy, and Calumny, even when
he means no body any hurt in his grave. I think therefore twere better to make
ten challenges at all manner of weapons, then to play a Scholars Prize, upon a
booksellers stall, for the one draws but blood: by the other a man is drawn
and quartred, take heed of Critics. they bite (like fish) at any thing,
especially at books. But the Devil being Let loose amongst them, I hope they
will not exercise their Coniurations upon him: If they do, they are damb'd. In
despite of Brontes and Steropes, that forge Arrows of Ignorance and contempt,
to shoot at Learning, I have hamerd out this Engine, that has beaten open the
Infernal Gates, and discouerd that great Tobaconist the Prince of Smoke and
darkness, Don Pluto. A supplication was sent to him long since by a poor fellow
one Pierce Pennylesse. But the Devil being full of business, could never til now
have leisure to answer it: Mary now (since Christmas) he has drawn out some
spare hours, and shot 2. Arrows at one mark, in 2. several Bows: and of two
contrary flights: Wherein he proves himself, a damb'd lying Cretan, because
he is found in two Tales, about one matter. But it may be, the first Answer,
that he sent by the Post was in the Morning, (fot he strives to speak
soberly, gravely, and like a Puritan) The other (sure) in the afternoon, for
he talks more madly: But so far from Those fantastical Taxations etc.
Which the Gentleman that drew that forenoones piece, (whom I know not) seems
aloof off (like a Spy) to discover, that even in the most triuiall and
merriest Applications, there are Seria locis, how soever it be, sithence we
both have had to do with the Devil, and that he is now [by our means)
brought to the Bar, let him plead for himself: Yshis Answers be good, it is
strange, because no goodness can come from him, Yfbad, and like thee not, thou
have the amends in thine own hands: never rail at him: for the Devil (like a
drunkard) cares for no body.

Farewell.

The Devil let loose, WITH His Answer to Pierce Pennylesse.
GReat wagers were laid in the world, that when the Supplication was sent, it
would not be received; or if received, it would not be read over; or if read
over, it would not be answered: for Mammon being the god of no beggars, but
Burgomasters and rich Cormorants, was worse thought of than he deserved: Every
man that did but pass through Paul's Churchyard, and had but a glaunce at the
Title of the Petition, would have betted ten to five, that the Devil would
hardly (like a Lawyer in a busy Term) be spoken with, because his Clyent had
not a penny to pay sees, but sued in Forma pauperis.

Had it been a Challenge, it is clear he would have answered it: for he was
the first that kept a Fence-schoole, when Cayn was alive, and taught him the
Embrocado, by which he killed his brother: Since which time he has made ten
thousand Free scholars as cunning as Cayn. At sword and buckler, little Dauy
was no body to him, and as for Rapier and Dagger, the Germane may be his
iourneyman. Mary the question is, in which of the Play Houses he would have
performed his Prize, if it had grown to blows, and whether the money being
gathered, he would have cozende the Fencers, or the Fencers him, because Hell
being under every one of their Stages, the Players (if they had owed him a
spite) might with a false Trappe door have slipped him down, and there kept
him, as a laughing stock to al their yawning Spectators. Or had his
Infernallship been arrested to any action how great so ever, all the Law in
Westminster Hall could not have kept him from appearing to it (for the Devil
scorns to be nonsuited) he would have answered to that too: But the mischief
would have been, where should he have got any that would have pleaded for him?
who could have endured to see such a damnable Client every morning in his
Chamber? what waterman (for double his fare) would have landed him at the
Temple, but rather have struck in at White-Fryers, and left him there ashore
with a Pox to him? Tush: there was no such matter, the stream he was to
venture into, was not so dangerous, this Coyner of Light angels knew well
enough how the Exchange went, he had but bare words lent unto him, and to pay
bare words again (though with some Interest) it could be no loss.

He resolved therefore to answer his humble Orater: But being himself not
brought up to learning (for the Devil ean neither write not read) yet he has
been at all the Universities in Christendom, and thrown heresies (like bones
for dogs to gnaw upon) amongst the Doctors themselves: but having no skill
but in his own Horne-booke, it troubled his mind where he should get a
penman fit for his tooth to scribble for him, all the Scriueners ith town he
had at his beck, but they were so set a work with making bonds between
Usurers and Unthrifty heirs, between Merchants and Tradesmen (that to coozen
and undo others, turn Banke-rowtes themselves, and defeat Creditors) and
with drawing close conueyances between Landlords and Bawdes, that now sit no
longer upon the skirtes of the City, but iett up and down, even in the
cloak of the City, and give more rent for a house, then the proudest London
occupier of them all, that Don Lucifer was loath to take them from their
Nouerints, because in the end he knew they were but his Factors, and that he
should be a part-owner in their lading himself; Lawyers clerks were so
durtied up to the hammes with trudging up and down to get pelf, and with
fishing for gudgeons, and so wrung poor ignorant clients purses, with exacting
unreasonable Fees, that the Paymaster of Perdition would by no means take them
from their wide lines, and bursten-bellied straddling ffs, but stroking them
under the chinnes, called them his white boys, and told them he would empty the
Inke-pot of some others.

Whither then marches Monsieur Malesico? Mary to all the writing Schoolemasters
of the town. He took them by the fists and liked their hands exceedingly (for
some of them had ten or twelve several hands and could counterfeit any thing)
but perceiving by the copies of their countenances, that for all their good
letters, they writ abominable bad English, and that the world would think the
Devil a Dunce, if there came false Orthographie from him (though there be no
truth in his budget) away he gallops from those tell-tales (the
Schoolemasters) damning himself to the pit of Hell, if Pierce Pennylesse
should ever get a good word at his hands.

I hearing this, and fearing that the poor Suppliant should lose his longing,
and be sent away with Si nihil attuleris, resolved (even out of my love to
Pierce Pennylesse, because he has been always a companion to Scholars,) to
do that for nothing, which a number would not for any money.

I fell to my tools (pen, ink, and paper) roundly, but the Head warden of the
Horners (Signior Beco Diauolo) after he had cast up what lay in his stomach,
suspecting that I came rather as a spy to betray him, then as a spirit to
run of his errands, and that I was more likely to have him to Barber Surgeons
hall, there to Anatomize him, then to a Barbers shop to trim him neately,
would by no means have the answer go forward: Notwithstanding, having
examined him upon Interrogatories, and thereby sifting him to the very bran. I
swore by Hellicon, (which he could never abide) that because it is out a fashion
to bring a Devil upon the Stage, he should (spite of his spitting fire and
Brimstone) be a Devil in print. Enraged at which, he flung away in a fury, and
leapt into Barathrum, whilst I mustred all my wits about me, to fight against
this Captain of the damned Crew, and discover his Stratagems.

Wonder is the daughter of ignorance, none but fools therefore will marvel,
how I and this Grand Sophy of the whore of Babylon came to be so familiar
together, or how we met, or how I knew where to find him, or what Charms I
carried about me whilst I talked with him, or where (if one had occasion to
use his Diuellship) a Porter might fetch him with a wet finger.

Tush, these are silly inquisitions; his acquaintance is more cheap, then a
common Fiddlers; his lodging is more known then an English Bawdes, a midwiues or
a phisicions; and his walks, more open to all Nations, then those upon the
Exchange, where at every step a man is put in mind of Babell, there is such a
confusion of languages. For in the Term time, my Caualiero Cornuto runs
sweatingvp and down between Temple-barre, and Westminster hall, in the habit
of a knight Errant, a swearing knight, or a knight of the Post: All the
Vacation you may either meet him at dicing Ordinaries, like a captain; at
cocke-pits, like a young country gentleman; or else, at a bowling ally in a
flat cap, like a shop keeper: every market day you may take him in
Cheape-side, poorly attirde like an Ingrosser, and in the afternoones, in the
twopeny rooms of a Playhouse, like a Puny, seated Cheek by Iowle with a
Punke: In the heat of Summer he commonly turns Intelligencer, and carries
tales between the Archduke and the Grave: In the depth of Winter, he sits
tippling with the Flemmings in their towns of Garrison.

Having therefore (as Chamber-maides use to do sor their Ladies faces
ouernight) made ready my colors, the pencell being in my hand, my card
lined, my needle (that capers over two and thirty points of the Compass)
touched to the quick, East, West, North, and South, the four Trumpetters of
the World, that never blow themselves out of breath, like four dropsy Dutch
Captains standing Centinells in their quarters, I will ingeniously and boldly
give you the Map of a country, that Iyes lower then the 17. valleys of Belgia,
yea lower then the Cole-pits of Newcastle, is far more dark, far more
dreadful, and fuller of knauerie, then the Colliers of those fire-workes are.

The name of this strange Country is Hell; In discovery of which, the
Quality of the Kingdom, the condition of the Prince, the estate of the
people, the Traffic thither (marie no transportation of goods from thence)
shall be painted to the life. It is an Empire, that Iyes under the Torrid Zone,
and by that means is hotter at Christmas, then it is in Spain or France (which
are counted plaguey hot Countries) at Midsummer, or in England when the dog
days bite sorest: for to say truth (because it is sin to belie the Devil)
the Universal Region is built altogether upon Stoues and Hotte-houses, you
cannot set foot into it, but you have a Fieri facias seru'de upon you: for
like the Glasse-house Furnace in Blacke-friers, the bonefiers that are kept
there, never go out; insomuch that all the Inhabitants are almost broylde like
Carbonadoes with the sweating sickness, but the best is (or rather the worst)
none of them die on it.

And such dangerous hot shottes are all the women there, that whosoever
meddles with any of them is sure to be burnt: It stands farther off then the
Indies: yet to see the wonderful power of Navigations, if you have but aside
Wind, you may sail sooner thither, than a married man can upon S. Lukes day to
Cuckolds haven, from S. Katherines, which upon sound experience, and by the
opinion of many good Mariners, may be done in less than half an hour. If
you travel by land to it, the ways are delicate, even, spacious, and very
fair, but toward the end very foul: the paths are beaten more bare, than the
livings of Churchmen. You never turn, when you are traveling thither, but
keep altogether on the left hand, so that you cannot lose your self, unless
you desperately do it of purpose.

The miles are not half so long as those between Colchester and Ipswich in
England, nor a quarter so durtie in the wrath of Winter, as your French miles
are at the fall of the leaf.

Some say, it is an Island, embrac'de about with certain Rivers, called the
waters of Sorrow: Others prove by infallible Demonstration, that it is a
Continent, but so little beholden to Heaven, that the Sun never comes amongst
them.

How so ever it be, this is certain, that it is exceeding rich, for all Usurers
both Jews and Christians, after they have made away their Souls for money
here, meet with them there again: You have of all Trades, of all Professions,
of all States some there: you have Popes there, as well as here, Lords there, as
well as here, Knights there as well as here, Aldermen there, as well as here,
Ladies there, as well as here, Lawyers there, as well as here, Soldiers march
there by millions, so do Citizens, so do Farmers, very few Poets can be
suffered to live there, the Colonel of Coniurers drives them out of his Circle,
because he fears they will write libells against him: yet some pitiful
fellows (that have faces like fire-drakes, but wits cold as Whetstones, and
more blunt) not Poets indeed, but ballad-makers, rub out there, and write
Infernals: Marry players swarm there as they do here, whose occupation being
smelt out, by the Cacodaemon, or head officer of the Country, to be
lucratiue, he purposes to make up a company, and to be chief sharer himself,
De quibus suo loco, of whose doings you shall hear more by the next carrier:
but here is the mischief, you may find the way thither, though you were blinder
then Superstition, you may be set ashore there, for less then a Scullers
fare: Any Vintners boy, that has been cup bearer to one of the 7. deadly sins
but half his years, any Merchant of maiden heads, that brings commodities out
of Virginia, can direct you thither: But neither they nor the weather-beatenst
Cosmographicall Starre-catcher of em all, can take his oath, that it lies just
under such an Horizon, whereby many are brought into a fools Paradise, by
gladly believing that either there is no such place at all, or else, that it is
built by Inchauntment, and stands upon Fayrie ground, by reason such pinching
and nipping is known to be there, and that how well favored soever we depart
hence, we are turned to Changelings, if we tarry there but a minute.

These Territories, notwithstanding of Tartarie, will I undermine and blow up
to the view of all eyes, the black and dismal shores of this Phlegetonticke
Ocean, shall be in ken, as plainly as the white (now vnmaydend breasts of our
own Island:) China, Peru and Cartagena, were never so ^ifled: the winning of
Cales, was nothing to the ransacking of this Troy that is all on fire: the very
bowels of these Infernal Antipodes, shall be ripped up, and pulld out, before
that great Dego of Devils his own face: Nay, since my flag of defiance is hung
forth, I will yield to no truce, but with such Tamburlaine-like fury march
against this great Turk, and his legions, that Don Beelzebub shall be ready to
damme himself, and be hornemad: for with the coniuring of my pen, al Hell
shall break loose.

Assist me therefore, thou Genius of that ven. trous, but Jealous musicion of
Thrace (Euridices husband) who being besotted on his wife (of which sin none
but Cuckolds should be guilty) went alive (with his fiddle at's back,) to see
if he could bail her out of that Adamantyne prison; the fees he was to pay for
her, were Iigs and country daunces: he paid the^: the forfeits, if he put on
yellow stockings and looked back upon her, was her everlasting lying there,
without bail or Maynprize: the loving coxco^b could not choose but look back,
and so lost her, (perhaps he did it, because he would be rid of her.) The
moral of which is, that if a man leave his own business, and have an eye to
his wives doings, she will give him the slip, though she run to the Devil for
her labor, Such a journey (sweet Orpheus) am I to undertake, but Jove forbid my
occasion should be like thine; for if the Marshall himself should rake Hell
for wenches, he could not find worse, (no nor so bad) there, as are here upon
earth. It were pity any woman should be damned, for she would have tricks (once
in a moon) to put the Devil forth of his wits. Thou (most clear throated
singing man,) with thy harp (to the twinkling of which, inferior spirits
skipt like goats over the Welsh mountains) had privilege, because thou were
a Fiddler, to be sawey, and to pass and repasse through every room, and into
every nook of the Devils wine-celler: Inspire me therefore with thy cunning
that carried thee thither, and thy courage that brought thee from thence, teach
me which way thou went in, and how thou scapt'st out, guide me in true
fingering, that I may strike those tunes which thou plaid'st (every dinner and
supper) before that Emperor of Low Germany, and the brabbling States under
him: Lucifer himself daunced a Lancashire Horne-pipe, whilst thou were there.
If I can but harp upon thy string, he shall now for my pleasure tickle up the
Spanish Pauin. I will call upon no Midwiues to help me in those Throws, which
(after my brains are fallen in labor) I must suffer, (yet Midwiues may be had
up at all hours) nor upon any coniurer, (yet coniurers, thou know, are
fellow and fellow-like with Monsieur Malediction, as Puncks are, who raize him
likewise up continually in their Circaean Circles) or as Brokers are, who day
and night study the black Art: No, no (thou Mr of thy musical company) I sue
to none, but to thee, because of thy Prick-song: For Poetry (like honesty and
old Soldiers) goes upon lame feet, unless there be music in her.

And thou, into whose soul (if ever there were a Pithagorean Metempsuchosis)
the raptures of that fiery and inconfinable Italian spirit were bounteously
and boundlesly infused, thou sometimes Secretary to Pierce Pennylesse, and
Master of his requests, ingenious, ingenuous, fluent, facetious, T. Nash: from
whose abundant pen, honey flowed to thy friends, and mortal Aconite to thy
enemies: thou that made the Doctor a flat Dunce, and beat'st him at two
sundry tall Weapons, Poetry, and Oratorie: Sharpest Satyr, Luculent Poet,
Elegant Orator, get leave for thy Ghost, to come from her abiding, and to dwell
with me a while, till she has carows'd to me in her own wo^ted full measures
of wit, that my plump brains may swell, and burst into bitter Inuectiues
against the Lieftennant of Limbo, if he casheere Pierce Pennylesse with dead
pay. But the best is, Facilis descensus Auerni, we may quickly have a ring
through his nose if he do: Its but slipping down a hill, and you shall fall into
the devils lap presently. And that is the reason (because his sinfulnes is so
double-diligent, as to be at your elbow with a call, wherein he gives good
examples to Drawers, if they had grace to follow his steps) that you swalow
down that News first, which should be eaten last: For you see at the
beginning, the Devil is ready to open his mouth for an Answer, before his
hour is come to be set to the Bar.

Since therefore, a Tale of the whole voyage would make any liquorish mouthed
Newes-monger lick his lips after it, no man's teeth shall water any longer, he
shall have it; for a very brief Cronicle shall be gathered, of all the memorable
occurrents, that presented themselves to the view of our wandering Knight in his
journey, the second part of Erra paters Almanacke, whose shoes, Platoes Cap
was not worthy to wipe, shall come forth, and without lying (as you
Calender-mongers use to do,) tell what weather we had all the way he went, to
a drop of rain: we will not lose him, from the first minute of his iumping a
shipboard, to the last of his leaping a shore, and arrival at Tamor Chams
Court (his good Lord and Master) the Devil.

The Post therefore having put up his packet, blows his horn, and gallops all
the way, like a Citizen, so soon as ever he is on horseback, down to
Billins-gate, for he meant when the Tide served to angle for Souls and some
other fresh fish in that goodly fishpond the Thames, as he passed over it, in
Grauesend Barge: that was the water coach he would ride in, there he knew he
should meet with some voluntaries that would venture along with him: In this
passage through the City, what a number of Lord Mayors, Aldermens, and rich
Commoners sons and heirs kept a hallowing out at Tauerne-windowes to our
knight, and wafted him to their Gascoigne shores with their hats only, (for
they had mol ted away all their feathers) to have him strike sail and come up
to them: he vaild, and did so: their fantastic salutations being
complemented, with much entreaty (because he stood upon Thorns) he was
aduaunc'd (in regard of his Knighthood) to the upper end of the board: you must
take out your writing tables, and note by the way, that every room of the
house was a Cage full of such wild foul, Et crimine ab vno disce omnes, cut up
one, cut up all, they were birds all of a beak, not a Woodcocks difference
among twenty dozen of them; every man had before him abale of dice, by his side
a brace of Punks, and in his fist a nest of bowls. It was springtide sure,
for all were full to the brimmes, with French being turned into English (for
they swum up and down the River of Burdeux) signified thus much, that dicing,
drinking, and drabbing, (like the three seditious Jews in Jerusalem) were the
civil plagues, that very vnciuily destroyed the Sons (but not the sins) of
the City.

The blood of the grape coming up into their cheeks, it was hard to judge,
whether they blushed to see themselves in such a pickle, or looked red with
anger one at another: but the troth is, their faces would take any dye but a
blush-colour, and they were not made of the right mettle of courage to be
angry, but their wits, (like wheels in Brunswick clocks) being all wound up,
so far as they could stretch, were all going, but not one going truly.

For some cursed their birth, some their bringing up, some rayled upon their
own Nation, others upon Strangers. At the last, one of these Acolasti playing
at doublets with his pue-fellow (which they might well do, being almost driven
to their shirts) and hearing upon what Theme the rest sung Ex tempore, out
draws his poniard, and stabbing the tables, as if he meant to have murdered the
thirty men, swore he could find in his heart to go presently (having drunk
vpsie Dutch) and piss even upon the Curmudgion his fathers grave: for, says
he, no man has more undone me, than he that has done most for me i will stand
to it, it is better to be the son of a Cobbler, then of a Common council man: if
a Cobblers son and heir run out at heels, the whoreson patch may mend
himself; but we whose friends leave us well, are like hour glasses turned up,
though we be never so full, we never leave running, till we have emptied our
selves, to make up the mouths of slaves, that for gain are content to lie
under us, like Spaniels, fawning, and receive what falls from our superfluity.
Who breeds this disease, in our bones? Whores? No, alack let us do them right,
it is not their fault, but our mothers, our cockering mothers, who for their
labor make us to be called Cockneys, or to hit it home indeed, those golden
Asses our fathers.

It is the old man, it is Adam, that lays a curse upon his Posterity: As for
my Dad, it is well known, he had ships reeling at Sea, (the vnlading of which
gives me my load now, and makes me stagger on land) he had ploughs to tear
up dear years out of the guts of the earth in the country, and Yeomens sons,
North contrymen, fellows (that might have been Yeomen of the Guard for
feeding,) great boys with beards, whom he took to be Prentizes, (mary never
any of them had the grace to be free,) and those lads (like Sarieants) tore out
men's throats for him to get money in the City: he was richer then Midas, but
more wretched then an Alchumist: so covetous that in gardning time, because he
would not be at the cost-of a load of Earth, he parde not his nails for
seven years together, to the intent the dirt that he filcht under them,
should serve for that purpose: So that they hung over his Fingers, like so
many shooing-hornes: do but imagine how far ever any man ventred into Hell
for money, and my father went a foot farther by the standard, and why did he
this, think you? he was so sparing, that he would not spend so much time as
went to the making up of another child, so that all was for me, he cozend
young gentlemen of their land, only for me, had acres morgadgde to him by
wise-acres for three hundred pounds, paid in hobby horses, dogs, bells, and
lutestrings, which if they had bine sold by the drum, or at an outrop, with the
cry, of No man better? would never have yielded 50. li. and this he did only for
me, he built a Pharos or rather a Block-house beyond the galows at Wapping, to
which the black fleet of cole carriers that came from Newcastle, struck sail,
were brought a bed, and discharged their great bellies there, like whores in
hugger mugger, at the common price with twelve pence in a chaulderouer and
above, thereby to make the common wealth blow her nails till they ak'de for
cold, unless she gave money to sit by his fire, only for me: the poor cursed
him with bell, book and candle, till he looked blacker with their execration,
then if he had been blasted, but he card not what dogs barkt at him, so
long as they bit not me: his houskeeping was worse then an Irish Kernes, a Rat
could not commit a Rape upon the paring of a moldy cheese, but he died for it,
only for my sake, the lean Jade Hungarian would not lay out a penny pot of
sack for himself, though he had eaten stinking fresh Herring able to poison a
dog, only for me, because his son and heir should drink eggs and
muskadine, when he lay rotting.

To conclude, he made no conscience, to run quick to the Devil of an errand,
so I had sent him. Might not my father have been begged (think you) better
then a number of scuruy things that are begd? I am persuaded, fools would be a
rich Monopoly, if a wise man had em in hand: would they had begun with him,
I Will be sworn, he was a fat one: for had he filled my pockets with silver, and
the least corner of my coxcomb with wit how to save that silver, I might have
been called upon by this, whereas now I am ready to give up my cloak: Had he
set me to Grammar school, as I set my self to dancing school, in stead of
treading Carontoes, and making Fiddlers fat with rumps of Capons, I had by this
time read Homilyes, and fed upon Tithe-pigges of my own vicaridge, whereas
now, I am ready to get into the Prodigals service, and eat Jones nuts, that is
to say, Acorns with swine: But men that are wisest for officers, are commonly
arrand woodcoks, for fathers: He that prouides living for his child, and robs
him of learning, turns him into a Beetle, that flies from perfumes and sweet
Odours, to feed on a cow-sheard; all such rich men's darlings are either
christened by some left handed Priest, or else borne under a threepenny Planet,
and then thei'le never be worth a groat, though they were left Landlords of the
Indies. I confess, when all my golden veins were shrunk up, and the bottom
of my Patrimony came within 200. pound of vnraueling, I could for all that have
been dubbed: But when I saw how mine uncle played at chesse, I had no stomach to
be Knighted. Why, says the Post? Mary quoth he, because when I prepared to
fight a battle on the Chesse-board, a Knight was always better then a Pawn:
But the Usurer mine Uncle made it plain, that a good pawn now was better
then a Knight.

At this the whole Chorus summos mouere Cachinnos, laughed til they grind again,
and called for a fresh gallon, all of them falling on their knees, and drawing
out silver and guilt rapyers (the only monuments that were left of hundreds
and thousands in Pecuniis numeratis, swore they would drink up these in deep
Healthes, to their howling fathers, so they might be sure the pledging should
choke them, because they brought them into the Inn of the World, but left
them not enough to pay their ryotous reckonings, at their going out.

The knight was glad he should carry such welcome news with him, as these, to
the clouen-footed Synagogue, and tickled with immoderate joy, to see the world
run upon such rotten wheels. Whereupon, pleading the necessity of his
departure, he began first to run over his Alphabet of Congees, and then with a
French Basilez, slipped out of their company.

But they knowing to what cape he was bound, hung upon him, like so many
beggars on an Almoner, importing, and coniuring him, by the love he did owe to
Knighthood, and arms, and by his oath, to take up downe-cast Ladies whom they
had there in their companies, and whom they were bound in Nature and humanity,
to relieve: that he would signify to their fathers, how course the thread of
life fell out to be now toward the Fagge end: that therefore, if any of them
had (inth' days of his abomination, and idolatry to money) bound the spirit of
gold, by any charms, in Caves or in iron fetters under the ground, they should
for their own souls quiet (which questionless else would whyne up and down)
if not for the good of their children, release it, to set up their decayed
estates. Or if there had been no such coniuring in their life times, that they
would take up money of the Devil, (though they forfeyted their bonds) and lay by
it for ever, or else get leave with a Keeper, to try how much they might be
trusted for among their old customers upon earth, though within two days
after, they proved Banke-rupts by Proclamation. The Postmaster of Hell
plainly told them, that if any so Seditious a fellow as gold, were cast into
Prison: their fathers would never give their consent to have him ransomed:
because there is more greedines among them below, then can be in the Hye-land
cou^tryes above: so that if all the Lordships in Europ were offered in Morgage
for a quarter their value, not so much as 13. pence half penny can be had from
thence, though a man would hang himself for it: And as for their fathers
walking abroad with keepers, alas, they lie there upon such heavy Executions,
that they cannot get out for their souls. He counsels them therefore to draw
arrows out of another quiver, for that these marks stand out of their reach,
the ground of which counsel, they all vow to trauerse: Some of them resolving
to cast out liquorish baits, to catch old, (but fleshly) wealthy widows, the
fire of which sophisticated love, they make account shall not go out, so long as
any drops of gold can be distilled from them: Others swear to live and dye in a
man of War, though such kind of Theeuerie be more stale then Sea-beefe: the
rest, that have not the hearts to shed blood, having reasonable stocks of wit,
mean to employ em in the sins of the Suburbs, though the Pox lies there as
deaths Legyer: For since man is the clock of time, they will all be times
Sextens, and set the Dial to what hours they list.

Our Vant'currer applauded the lots which they drew for themselves, and offered
to pay some of the Tavern Items: but they protesting he should not spend a
Baw-bee, as he was true knight consedere Duces, they sat down to their Wine,
and he hasted to the water.

By this time is he landed at Graues-end, (for they whom the Devil drives,
feel no lead at their heels) what stuff came along with him in the Bargc,
was so base in the weauing, that it is too bad to be set out for sale: It was
only Luggadge, therefore throw it over board. From thence hoysting up sail
into the Maine, he struck in among the Dunkerks, where he encountered such a
number of all Nations with the dregs of all Kingdoms vices dropping upon them,
and so like the Black Gentleman, his Master, that he had almost thought
himself at home, so near do those that lie in Garrison there, resemble the
Desperuatoes that fill up Plutoes Muster-Booke: But his head beating on a
thousand Anuiles, the scolding of the Cannon drew him speedily from thence: So
that creeping up along by the rank Flemmish shores (like an Euesdropper) to
whisper out what the brabbling was, he only set down a note for his memory,
that the States sucking Poison out of the sweet flower of Peace, but keeping
their coffers sound and healthful by the bitter pills of War, made their
country a pointing stock to other Nations, and a miserable Anatomy to
themselves.

The next place he called in at, was France, where the Gentlemen, to make Apes
of Englishmen, whom they took daily practicing all the foolish tricks of
fashions after their Monsieur-ships, with yards in stead of leading Staves,
mustred all the French Tailors together, who, by reason they had thin hair,
wore thimbles on their heads in stead of Harness caps, every man being armed
with his sheeres and pressing Iron, which he calls there his goose (many of
the^ being in France:) All the cross caperers being placed in strong ranks,
and an excellent oration cut out and sticht together, persuading them to sweat
out their very brains, in devising new french cuts, new french collors, new
french codpeeces, and new french panes in honor of Saint Dennys, only to make
the giddy-pated Englishman consume his revenues in wearing the like clothes,
which on his back at the least can show but like cast suits being the second
edition, whilst the poor French peasant iets up and down, (like a Pantaloun)
in the old threadbare cloak of the Englishman, so that we buy fashions of
them to fether our pride, and they borrow rags from us to cover their beggary.
The Spaniard was so busy in touching heaven with a lance, that our Knight of
the burning shield, could not get him at so much leisure, as to eat a dish of
Pilchers with him. The gulf of Venice he purposes shall therefore swallow a few
hours of his observation, where he no sooner sets footing on shore, but he
encou^ters with Lust, so ciuilly suited, as if it had bin a Merchants wife:
Whoremongers there, may utter their commodities as lawfully, as Costermongers
here, they are a company as free, and have as large privileges for what they
do, as any of the twelve Companyes in London. In other countries Lechery is
but a Chamber-mayd: Here, a great Lady: She Is a retaylor and has warrant to
sell souls, and other small wares, under the Seal of the City: Sin here
keeps open market: Damnation has a price set upon it, and dares go to Law
for her own: For a Curtizans action of the Case, will hold as well as a Usurers
plea of debt, for ten 'ith hundred. If Bridewell stood in Venice, a golden key
(more easily then an iron picklocke) would open all the doors of it: For
Lechery here lies night and day with one of prides daughters (Liberty,) and so
sarre is the infection of this Pestilence spread, that every boy there has much
harlot in his eyes: Religion goes all in changeable silks, and wears as many
maskes as she does colors: Churches stand like Rocks, to which very few
approach, for fear of suffering shipwreck.

The seven deadly sins, are there in as great authority, as the seven
Electors in Germany, and women in greater then both: In so much as drunkenness,
which was once the Dutchmans head-ake, is now become the Englishmans: so
ielozy, that at first was whipped out of Hell, because she tormented even
Devils, lies now every hour in the Venecians bosom: Every noble man grows
there like a Beech tree, for a number of beasts couch under his shade: every
gentleman aspires rather to be counted great then good, weighing out good
words by pounds, and good deeds by drams: their promises are Eeues, their
performances hollidayes, for they work hard upon the one, and are idle on the
other: Three things there are dog-cheap, learning, poor men's sweat, and oaths:
farmers in that country are petty Tyrants, and Landlords, Tyra^ts over those
farmers, Epicures grow as fat there, as in England, for you shall have a slave
eat more at a meal, then ten of the Guard, and drink more in two days, then
all Maningtree does at a Whitsun ale. Our Rankrider of the Stygia^ borde^rs,
seeing how well these Pupils profited under their Italian Schole-master, and
that all countries lived obedient to the Luciferan laws, resolved to change
Post-hors no more, but to conclude his Perigrinatio^, having seen fashions,
and gotten table-talke enough by his travel. In a few minutes therefore is he
come to the banck-side of Acheron, where you are not bayted by whole kennels of
yelping watermen, as you are at Westminster-bridge, and ready to be torn in
pieces to have two pence rowed out of your purse: no, Ship wrights there could
hardly live, there is but one boat, and in that one, Charon is the only
Ferri-ma^, so that if a Cales Knight should bawle his heart out, he cannot get a
pair of oars there, to do him grace with (I plied your worship first) but
must be glad to go with a Sculler: By which means, though the fare be small
(for the watermans wages was at first but a half penny, then it came to a penny,
it is now mended, and is grown to three half pence, for all things wax dear
in Hell, as well as upon earth, by reason it is so populous) yet the gains of
it are greater in a quarter, then ten Western Barges get in a year: Dotchet
Ferry comes nothing near it.

It is for all the world, like Graues-end Barge: and the passengers privileged
alike, for there is no regard of age, of sex, of beauty, of riches, of valor, of
learning, of greatness, or of birth: He that comes in first, sits no better then
the lost.

Will Summers gives not Richard the Third the cushions, the Duke of Guize and
the Duke of Shore-ditch have not the breadth of a bench between them, Jane Shore
and a Goldsmiths wife are no better one then another.

Kings and Clownes, Soldiers and Cowards, Churchmen and Sextons, Aldermen, and
Cobblers, are all one to Charon: For his Naulum, Luck (the old Recorders fool)
shall have as much mat, as Sir Lancelot of the Lake: He knows, though they had
an oar in every man's Boat in the World, yet in his they cannot challenge so
much as a Stretcher: And therefore (though he sails continually with wind and
Tide,) he makes the prowdest of them all, to stay his leisure. It was a Comedy,
to see what a crowding (as if it been at a new Play) there was upon the
Acherontique Strond, so that the Post was feign to tarry his turn, because he
could not get near enough the shore: He purposed therefore patiently to walk
up and down, till the Coast was clear, and to note the codition of all the
passengers. Amongst whom there were Courtyers, that brought with em whole
trunks of apparel, which they had bought, and large pattents for Monopolyes,
which they had begged: Lawyers laden with Leases, and with purchased Lordships,
Clergy men, so pursy and so windlesse with bearing three or four Church
livings, that they could scarce speak: M^rchants laden with baggs of gold, for
which they had robbed their princes custom: Scholars with Aristotle and Ramus
in cloake-bags, (as if they meant to pull down the Devil) in disputation,
being the subtillest Logician, but full of Sophistry: Captayns, some in guilt
armor (vnbattred,) some in buffe Ierkins, plated over with massy silver lace,
(rayzd out of the ashes of dead pay,) and banckrupt citizens, in swarms like
porters sweating basely under the burdens of that, for which other men had
sweat honestly before. All which (like Burgers in a Netherland town taken by
freebooters) were compelled to throw down bag and baggage, before they could
have pasport to be shipped into the Flemmish Hoy of Hell: For if every man
should be sufferd to carry with him out of the world that which he took most
delight in, it were enough to drown him, and to cast away the vessel he goes
in: Charon therefore strips them of all, and leaves them more bare then Irish
beggars: And glad they were (for all their howling to see themselves so
fleeced) that for their silver they could have wastage over. In therefore they
thrung, some wading up to the knees, and those were youngmen: they were loath to
make too much have, swearing they came thither before their time:

Some, up to the middles, and those were women, they seeing young men go
before them, were ashamed not to ve^ture farther than they: Others waded up to
the chin, and the old men, they seeing their gold taken from them, were
desperate, and would have drowned themselves: but that Charon slipping his Oar
under their bellies, tossed them out of the water, into his Wherry. The boat is
made of nothing but the wormeaten ribs of coffins, nayl'd together, with the
splinters of fleshlesse shin-bones, dig'd out of graves, being broken in
pieces. The sculls that he rows with, are made of Sextons spades, which had
been hung up at the end of some great Plague, the bench he sits upon, a rank
of dead men's sculls. The worst of them having been an Emperor, as great as
Charlemaine: And a huge heap of their beards serving for his cushion: the Mast
of the boat is an arm of an Yew tree, whose boughs (in stead of Rosemary) had
wont to be worn at buryals: The sail, two patcht winding sheets, wherein a
Broker and an Usurer had bin laid for their linen, will last longest, because
it comes commonly out of Lauender and is seldom worn.

The waterman himself is an old grisly-fac'd fellow: a beard filthyer then a
Bakers mawkin that he sweeps his oven, which hung full of knotted Elf-locks,
and serves him for a Swabber in soul weather to cleanse his Hulke: A pair of
eyes staring so wide (by being bleard with the wind) as if the liddes were
lifted up with gags to keep them open: More salt Rewmatick water runs out of
them, than would pickle all the Herrings that shall come out of Yarmouth: A
pair of hands so hard and scaled over with dirt, that passengers think he
wears gantlets, and more stinkingly musty are they than the fists of
night-men, or the fingers of bribery, which are never clean: His breath
belches out nothing but rotten damps, which lie so thick and foggie, on the
face of the Waters, that his Fare is half choakt, ere they can get to land:
The Sea-cole furnaces of ten Brew-howses, make not such a smoke, nor the Tallow
pans of fifteen Chaundlers (when they melt,) send out such a smell: He Is
dreadful in looks, and currish in language, yet as kind as a courtyer where he
takes. He sits in all storms bare-headed, for if he had a cap, he would not
put it of to a Pope: A gown girt to him (made all of Wolves skins) tanned
(figuring his greedynes) but worn out so long, that it has almost worn away
his elbows: He Is thick of hearing to them that sue to him, but to those
against whose wills he is sent for, a Fiddler hears not the creeking of a
window sooner.

As touching the River, look how Moore-ditch shows, when the water is three
quarters dreyn'd out, and by reason the Stomach of it is ouer-laden, is ready
to fall to casting so does that, it stinks almost worse, is almost as poisonous,
altogether so muddy, altogether so black: In taste very bitter, yet to those
that know how to distill these deadly waters,) very wholesome.

Charon, having discharged his freight, the Packetcaryer (that all this while
waited on the other side,) cride A boat, a boat: His voice was known by the
tune, and (weary though he were) over to him comes our Fery-man. To who^ (so
soon as ever he was set) Charon complains what a bawling there has bin, with
what Fares he has been posted, and how much tugging (his boat being so thwackt)
he has split one of his Oars, and broken his Bid-hooke, so that he can row
but lazily, till it be mended. And were it not that the soul pays excessive
Rent for dwelling in the body, he swears (by the Stygian Lake,) he would not
let em pass thus for a trifle, but raize his price: why may not he do it as
well as Punks and tradesmen? Hereupon he brags what a number of gallant felows
and goodly wenches went lately over with him, whose names he has in his book
and could giuehim, but that they earnestly entreated not to have their names
spread any farther (for their heirs sakes) because most of them were too great
in some men's books already. The only wonder (says Charon) that these
passengers drive me into, is, to see how strangely the world is altered since
Pluto and Proserpine were married: For whereas in the old time, men had wont to
come into his boat all slasht, (some with one arm, some with never a leg, and
others with heads like calves cleft to their shoulders, and the mouths of their
very wounds gaping so wide, as if they were crying A boat, a boat,) now
contrariwise, his fares are none, but those that are poisoned by their wives
for lust, or by their heirs for living, or burnt by whores, or reeling into
hell out of tauerns: or if they happen to come bleeding, their greatest glory
is a stab, upon the giving of a lie.

So that if the three Destinies spin no finer threads the^n these, men must
either, (like Aesculapius) be made immortal for mere pity sake, and be sent
up to Jupiter, or else the Land of Blackamoores must be made bigger: for the
great Lord of Tartary will shortly have no room for all his retayners, which
would be a great dishonor to him, considering he is now the only housekeeper.

By this time, Charon looking before him (as Watermen use to do) that is to
say, behind him, spied he was hard at shore: whereupon seeing he had such
doings (that if it held still) he must needs take a servant (and so make a
pair of oars for Pluto) he offered great wages to the Knight Passant, to be
his iourneyman: but he being only for the Devils land service, told him he
could not give over his service, but assuring him, he would inform his Mr.
(the King of Erebus) of all that was spoken, he paid the boat hyre fitting his
Knighthood, leapt ashore and so parted.

The ways are so plain, and our trauayler on foot so familyar with them, that
he came sooner to the court gates of Auernus, then his fellow (the Wherry-man)
could fasten his hook on the other side of Acheron: The porter (though he knew
him well enough and fawnd upon him,) would not let him pass, till he had his
due: for every officer there is as greedy of his Fees, as they are here. You
mistake, if you imagine that Plutoes porter is like one of those big fellows
that stand like Cyants at Lords gates) having bellies bumbasted with ale in
Lambs-wool, and with Sacks: and cheeks strutting out (like two footebals) being
blown up with powder beef and brewis: yet he is as surly as those Key-turners
are, but looks as little more scuruily: No, no, this doorekeeper wayts not to
take money of those that pass in, to behold the Infernal Tragedyes, neither
has he a lodge to dyne and sup in, but only a kennell, and executes his
bawling office merely for victuals: his name is Cerberus, but the howsehold
call him more properly, The Black dog of Hell: He has three heads, but no
hair upon them, (the place is too hot to keep hair on) for in stead of hayr
they are al curled ouerwith snakes, which reach from the crowns of his 3. heads
along the ridge of his back to his very tail, and that's wreathed like a
drago^s: twenty couple of hounds make not such a damnable noise, when they
howl, as he does when he barks: his property is to wag his tail, when any
comes for entrance to the gate, and to lick their hands, but upon the least
offer to escape out, he leaps at their throats; sure he is a mad dog, for
wheresoever he bites, it rankles to the death. His eyes are ever watching, his
ears ever listening, his paws ever catching, his mouths are gaping: Insomuch,
that day and night, he lies howling to be sent to Paris Garden, rather then to
be vs'de, so like a curre as he is.

The Post, to stop his throat, threw him a Sop, and whyl'st he was devouring
of that, he passed through the gates. No sooner was he entered, but he met with
thousands of miserable souls, pyneond and dragd in chains to the Bar, where
they were to receive their trial, with bitter lamentations bewayling (all the
way as they went) and with loud execratio^s cursing the bodies with whom they
sometimes frollickly kept company, for leading them to those impietyes, for
which they must now (even to their utter undoing) dearly answer: it was
quarter Sessions in Hell, and though the Postmaster had bin at many of their
Arraignments, and knew the horror of the Executions, yet the very sight of the
prisoners struck him now into an astonishable amazement.

On not withstanding he goes, with intent to deliver the Supplication, but so
busy was the Behomoth (the prince of the Devils) and such a press was within
the Court, and about the Bar, that by no thrusting or shouldring, could he
get access; the best time for him must be, to watch his rising, at the
adiourning of the Sessions, and therefore he skrews himself by all the
insynuating Art he can, into the thickest of the crow'd, and within reach of
the clarke of the Peaces voice, to hear all their Inditements.

The Judges are set, (being three in number) severe in look, sharp in
Justice, shrill in voice, vnsubiect passion: the prisoners are souls, that
have committed Treason against their Creation: they are called to the Bar,
their number infinite, their crimes numberless: The Jury that must pass upon
them, are their sins, who are impanel'd out of the several countries, and are
sworn to find whose Conscience is the witness, who upon the book of their
lives, where all their deeds are written, gives in dangerous evidence against
them, the Furies (who stand at the elbowe of their Conscience) are there ready
with stripes to make them confess, for either they are the Beadels of Hell
that whip souls in Lucifers Bridewell, or else his Executioners to put them to
worse Torments: The Inditements are of several qualities, according to the
several offenses; Some are arraigned for ambition in the Court; Some for
corruption in the Church; Some for cruelty in the camp; Some for
hollow-hartednes in the City; Some for eating men alive in the Country, every
particular soul has a particular sin, at his heels to condemn him, so that
to plead not guilty, were folly: to beg for mercy, madness: for if any
should do the one, he can put himself upon none but the devil and his angels:
and they (to make quick work) give him his pasport. If do the other, the
hands of ten Kings under their great Seals will not be taken for his pardon.
For though Conscience comes to this Court, poor in attire, diseased in his
flesh, wretched in his face, heavy in his gate, and hoarse in his voice, yet
carries he such stings within him, to torture himself, if he speak not truth,
that every word is a Judges sentence, and when he has spoken, the accused is
suffered neither to plead for him self, nor to fee any Lawier, to argue for
him.

In what a lamentable condition therefore stands the unhappy prisoner, his
Indictment is Impleadable, his evidence irrefutable, the fact impardonable, the
Judge impenitrable, the Judgment formidable: the tortures insufferable, the
manner of them invtterable: he must endure a death without dying, torments
ending with worse beginnings, by his shrikes others shall be affrighted,
himself afflicted, by thousands pointed at, by not one amongst millions
pitied, he shall see no good that may help him, what he most does love,
shall be taken from him, and what he most does loathe, shall be powered into his
bosom. Add hereunto the said cogitation of that dismal place, to which he is
condemned, the remembrance of which, is almost as dolorous, as the punishments
there to be endured. In what colors shall I lay down the true shape of it?
Assist me Invention.

Suppose that being gloriously attired, deliciously feasted, attended on
maiestically, Music charming thine ear, beauty thine eye; and that in the
very height of all worldly pomp that thought can aspire to, thou should be
tombled down, from some high goodly pinnacle, (builded for thy pleasure) into
the bottom of a Lake, whose depth is immeasurable, and circuit
incomprehensible: And that being there, thou should in a moment be ringed
about, with all the murderers that ever have been since the first foundation
of the world, with all the Atheists, all the Church-robbers, all the Incestuous
Rauishers, and all the polluted villains, that ever sucked damnation from the
breasts of black Impiety, that the place it self is gloomie, hideous, and in
accessible, pestilent by damps, and rotten vapors, haunted with spirits, and
pitched all over, with clouds of darkness, so clammy and palpable, that the
eye of the Moon is too dull to pierce through them, and the fires of the Sun
too weak to dissolve them, then that a Sulphurous stench must still strike up
into thy nosthrils, Adders and Toades be still crawling on thy bosom,
Mandrakes and night Ravens still shriking in thine ear, Snakes ever sucking at
thy breath, and which way soever thou turnest, a fire flashing in thine eyes,
yet yielding no more light than what with a glimse may show others how thou
art tormented, or else show unto thee the tortures of others, and yet the
flames to be so devouring in the burning, that should they but glow upon
mountains, of Iron, they were able to melt them like mountains of snow. And
last of all, that all these horrors are not wouen together, to last for years,
but for ages of worlds, yea for worlds of ages; Into what gulf of desperate
calamity, would not the poorest beggar now throw himself headlong, rather then
to taste the least dram of this bitterness, If imagination can give being to a
more miserable place than this described? Such a one, or worse than such a one,
is that, into which the guilty souls are led captive, after they have their
condemnation. And what tongue is able to relate the groans and vlulations of a
wretch so distressed, a hundred pens of steel would be worn blunt in the
description, and yet leave it unfinished.

Let us therefore sithence the Infernal Sessio^s are reiourned, and the court
breaking up, seek out his knightship who having waited all this while for the
Devil, has by this time delivered to his paws, the Supplication for poor
Pierce Pennyles, and so, Masuolio his Secretary is reading it to him, but
before he was up to the middle of it, the work master of Witches, snatched
away the paper, and thrust it into his bosom in great choler, railing at his
Letter carrier, and threatening to have him lasht by the Furies, for his
loytring so long, or Cauterizde with hot Irons for a Fugitive. But
Mephostophiles discoursing from point, to point, what pains he had taken in
the Survey of every Country, and how he had spent his time there, Serieant
Satan gave him his blessing, and told him that during his absence) both Pierce
Pennyles and the Poet that writ for him, have been landed by Charon, of whom he
willed to enquire within what part of their dominion, they have taken up their
lodging, his purpose is, to answer every word, by word of mouth, yet because
he knows, that at the return of his post ship, and walking upon the exchange
of the world, (which he charges him to hasten for the good of the Stygian
kingdom that altogether stands upon quick traffic) they will flutter about
him, crying, What news, what news? what squibs, or rather what pieces of
ordinance does the M. Gunner of Gehenna discharge against so saucy a suitor,
that by the Artillery of his Secretaries pen, has shaken the walls of his
kingdom, and made so wide a breach, that any Sir Giles may look into his, and
his Officers doings: to stop their mouths with some thing, stop them with
this: That touching the enlargement of Gold, (which is the first branch of the
Petition) So it is that Plutus his kinsman (being the only setter up of
tempting Idols) was borne a Cripple, but had his eyesight as fair as the day,
for he could see the faces and fashions of all men in the world, in a
twinkling. At which time, for all he went upon Crutches, he made shift to walk
abroad with many of his friends, Marry they were none but good men. A Poet, or
a Philosopher, might then have sooner had his company, than a Justice of Peace:
Virtue at that time, went in good clothes, and vice fed upon beggerie. Alms
baskets, honesty and plain dealing, had all the Trades in their own hands,
So that Unthrifts, Cheaters, and the rest of their Faction, (though it were the
greater) were borne down, for not an Angel durst be seen to drink in a
Tavern with them: whereupon they were all in danger to be famisht. Which
enormitie, Jupiter wisely looking into, and seeing Plutus dispersing his gifts
amongst none but his honest brethren, struck him (either in anger or envy)
stark blind, so that ever since he has plaide the good fellow, for now every
gull may lead him up and down like Guy, to make sports in any drunken
assembly, now he regards not who thrusts his hands into his pockets, nor what
money they take out, nor how it is spent, a fool shall have his heart now,
as soon as a Physician: And an Ass that cannot spell, go laden away with
double Ducats from his Indian Storehouse, when Ibis Homere, that has lain
sick seuenteen years together of the Vniuer-sitie plague, (watching and want)
only in hope at the last to find some cure, shall not for an hundred weight
of good Lattine, receive a two-penny weight in Silver, his ignorance (arising
from his blindness) is the only cause of this Comedy of errors: so that until
some Quack-saluer or other (either by the help of Tower hill water, or any
other, either Phisical or Chirurgicall means) can pick out that pin and a web,
which is stuck into both his eyes (and that will very hardly be) It is
irreuocably set down, in the Adamantine book of Fate, that gold shall be a
perpetual slave to slaves, a drudge to fools, a fool to make Woodcocks
merry, whilst wisemen mourn: or if at any time he chance to break prison, and
fly for refuge into the chamber of a Courtier, to a mere hawking country
Gentleman, to an Aldermans heir, to a young student at the law, or to any
tradesmans eldest son, that rides forth to cast up his fathers reckonings in
fortified Tauerns, Such mighty search shall be made for him, such Hue and Cry
after him, and such misrule kept, until he be smeltout, that poor gold must
be glad to get out of their company, Castles cannot protect him, but he must
be apprehended, and suffer for it. Now as touching the seven leaued tree, of
the deadly sins, (which Peirce-Pennilesse would have hewn down,) his
request is unreasonable, for that grows so rank in every man's garden, and
the flowers of it worn so much in every woman's bosom, that till the last
general Autumnian quarter of the dreadful year, when whole kingdoms (like
sear and saplesse leaves) must be shaken in pieces by the consuming breath of
fire, and all the fruits of the earth be raked together, by the spirit of
Storms, and burnt in one heap like stubble, till then, it is impossible to
clear the oaken forehead of it, or to loppe off any of the branches. And let
this satisfy itching Newes-hunters, for so much of mine answer to the poor
fellows Supplication, as I mean to have published to the world: what more I
have to utter, shall be in his ear, because he was more busy in his prating
then a Barber, with thee my servant, about my household affairs, and therefore
it is to be doubted he lurkes within our Cimerian Provinces, but as an
Intelligencer, which if it be proved, he shall buy it with his soul; dispatch
therefore (my faithful Incarnate Devil) proclaim these things to the next
Region above us.

Go and deliver my most-most hearty co^demnations to all those that steal
subjects hearts from their Sovereigns, say to althose, they shall have my
letters of Mart for their Piracie: factious Gnyziards, that lay trains of
sedition to blow up the co^mo^-wealth, I hug the^ as my children, to all those
churchmen that bind themselves together in schisms, like bu^dles of thorns,
only to prick the sides of Religion, till her heart bleed: I will give them
new orders; To all those that strip Orphans out of their portions, they shall
be mine Ingles: To all those that until their Neighbors houses, that whilst
storms are beating the^ out, they themselves may enter in, bestow upon such
officers of mine, a thousand condemnations from their master, tho they be
sitting at King Arthurs round Table: When thou do thy message, they shall
have Tenements of me for nothing in hell. In brief, tell all the Brokers in
Long-Lane, Houns-ditch, or else where, which all the rest of their Colleagned
Suburbians, that deal upon ouerworne commodities, and whose souls are to us
impawned, that they lie safe enough, and that no cheater shall hook them out of
our hands, bid them sweat and swear in their vocation (as they do hourly) if
thou being a knight of the Post, can not help them to oaths, that may make
the^ get the devil and al, they have a sound Card on their sides, for I my
self will Abi in malam, go and mind thy business.

His warrant being thus signde, the messenger departs, but before he could get
to the uttermost ferrie, he met with an old, lean, meagre fellow, whose eyes
was sunk so deep into his head, as if they had been set in backward, his
hair was thinner than his cheeks, and his cheeks so much worn awav, that
when he spoke his tongue smoakt, and that was burnt black, with his hot and
valiant breath, was seen to move too and fro so plainly, that a wise man might
have taken it for the Snuff of a candle in a Muscouie Lantern, the Barbar
Surgio^s had begde the body of a man at a Sessions to make an Anatomy, and
that Anatomy this wretched creature begged of them to make him a body, Charon
had but newly landed him: yet it seemde he stood in pitiful fear, for his
eyes were no bigger then pinnes heads, with blubbring and howling, and keeping
a coile to have some body show him the nearest way to hell, which he doubted
he had lost, the other puts him into a path, that would directly bring him
thither, but before he bid him farewell, our black knight inquired of him what
he was: who answered, that he was sometimes one that lived upon the Lechery of
mettalls, for he could make one hundred pound be great with child, and be
delivered with another in a very short time, his money (like pigions) laid
every month, he had been in upright terms, an Usurer: And understanding that
he fell into the hands of the hell post, he offered him after a penny a mile,
between that and the towns end he was going too, so he would be his guide.

Which money, when the watermen came to rifle him, he swallowed down, and rakte
for it afterward, because he knew not what need he should have, the ways
being damnable: But the goer of the devils errands, told him, if he would allow
him Pursiua^ts fees, he durst not earne them, he would do him any Knights
service, but to play the good Angels part, and guide him, he must pardon him.
Doctor Dives requests him (in a whining accent) to tell him if there were any
rich men in hell, and if by any base drudgery which the devil shall put him too,
and which heel willingly moile in, he should scrape any muck together, whether
he may set up his trade in hell, and whether there be any Brokers there, that
with picking strawes out of poor thatcht houses to build neastes where his
twelve pences should engender, might get feathers to his back, and their own
too. To all which questions, the vaut curier answers briefly, that he shall
meet a number there, who once went in black velvet coats, and welted gowns,
but of Brokers, there is a longer lane of them in hell, than there is in London.
Marry for opening shop, and to keep a Bawdy house for Lady Pecunia, Hoc si
fata negant, If the Bailiffe of Barathru^ deny that privilege to those that
have served twice seven years in the Freedom, there is no reason a Forrainer
should taste the favor.

This news tho it went coldly down, yet as those that are troubled with the
toothache, enquire of others what the pain is, that have had them drawn out,
and think by that means they lessen their own; So it is some ease to Sir
Timothy, thirty per centum, to harken out the worst that others have endured,
he desires therefore to know how far it is from the earth to hell; and being
told that hell is just so many miles from earth, as earth is from heaven, he
stands in a brown study, wondering (sithence the length of the iournies were
both alike to him, how it should happen, that he took rather the one path then
the other. But then cursing himself that ever he fell in love with money, and
that (which is contrary to nature) he ever made a cracked French Crown, beget
an English Angel, he roarde out, and swore, that his gold sure would damb him.
For says he, my greediness to feed mine eye with that, made me starve my
belly, and undo those for six pence, that were ready to starve. And into such
an Apoplexy of soul, fell I into with the lust of money, that I had no sense of
any other happiness: So that whilst in my Closet I sat numbering my bags, the
last hour of my life was told out, before I could tell the first heap of gold.
Birdlime is the sweat of the Oak tree, the dung of the Blackbird falling on
that tree, turns into that slimie snare, and in that snare, is the Bird her
self taken. So fares it me, money is but the excrement of the earth, in which
covetous wretches (like swine) rooting continually, eat through the earth so
long, till at length they eat themselves into hell. I see therefore, that as
Hearts, being the most cowardly and hartlesse creatures, have also the largest
horns, So we that are drudges to heaps of dross, have base and lean
consciences, but the largest damnation. There appeared to Timotheus, an
Athenian, Demorij vmbra, and that gave him a net to catch Cities in, yet for
all that he died a beggar. Sure it was Vmbra daemonis that taught me the rule
of Interest: for in getting that, I have lost the principal, (my soul). But I
pray you tell me, Says my Setter up of Scriueners, Must I be stripped thus out
of all? Shall my Fox furde gowns be locked up from me? Must I not have so much
as a shirt upon me? Heers worse pilling and polling the^ amongst my countrymen
the Usurers, not a rag of linen about me, to hide my nakedness.

No, says the Light Horseman of Lymbo, no linen is worn here, because none
can be wouen strong enough to hold, neither do any such good huswiues come
hither as to make cloth; only the Destinies are allowed to spin, but their
yarne serves to make smocks for Proserpina. You are now as you must ever be,
you shall need no clothes, the Air is so extreme hot; besides, there be no
Tailors suffered to live here, because (they as well as Plaiers) have a hell of
their own,) (under their shopboard) and there lie their tottered souls,
patcht out with nothing but rags.

This Careere being ended, our Lansquenight of Lowe-Germanie, was ready to put
spurs to his horse, and take leave, because he saw what disease hung upon
him, and that his companion was hard at his heels, and was loath to proceed in
his Journey.

But he, Qui nummos admiratur, the pawn groper, clingde about his knees like a
Horsleech, and coniurde him, as ever he pitied a wretch eaten to the bare
bones, by the sacred hunger of gold, that he would either bestow upon him, a
short Table (such a one as is tide to the tail of most Almanacks) chalking out
the hye-waies, be they never so durtie, and measuring the length of all the
miles between town, and town, to the breadth of a hair, or if this
Geographicall request took up too much conceald land to have it granted, that
yet (at last) he would tell him, whether he were to pass over any more
rivers, and what the name of this filthy puddle was, over which he was lately
brought by a dogged waterman, because sithence he must run into the devils
mouth, he would run the nearest way, least he wearied himself.

Of this last request, the Lacquy of this great Leuiathan, promisde he should
be master, but he would not bring him to a miles end by land, (they were too
many to meddle with). You shall understand therefore (says our wild Irish
footeman) that this first water (which is now cast behind you) is Acheron, It
is the water of trouble, and works like a Sea in a tempest (for indeed this
first is the worst) It has a thousand creekes, a thousand windings, and
turnings, It vehemently boyles at the bottom (like a Caldron of molten lead,)
when on the top it is smoother then a still stream: And upon great reason is
it calde the River of molestation, for when the soul of man is upon the point
of departing from the Shores of life, and to be shipped away into another world,
she is vexed with a conscience, and an auxious remembrance of all the parts that
ever she plaide on the unruly stage of the world: She repeats not by roate, but
by heart, the injuries done to others, and indignities wrought against her
self: She turns over a large volume of accounts, and finds that she is run
out in pride, in lusts, in riots, in blasphemies, in irreligion, in wallowing
through so many enormous and detestable crimes, that to look back upon them,
(being so infinite) and upon her own face (being so foul) the very thought
makes her desperate: She never spoke, or delighted to hear spoken, any bawdy
language, but it now rings in her ear, never lusted after luxurious meats, but
their taste is now upon her tongue, never sed the sight with any licentious
object, but now they come all into her eye, every wicked thought before, is
now to her a dagger, every wicked word a death, every wicked act a damnation:
If she escape falling into this Ocaean, she is miraculously saved from a ship
wrack, he must needs be a churlish but a cunning Waterman, that steeres in a
Tempest so dangerous: This first River is a bitter water in taste, and
unsavory in sent, but whosoever drinks down but half a draught of his
remembered former follies, Oh it cannot choose but be Amarulentum poculum, Gall
is honey to it, Acheron like is a thick water, and how can it otherwise choose,
being stirred with so many thousands fighting perturbations.

Having passed over this first River (as now you are) you shall presently have
your way stopped with another, Its a little cut by land thither, but a tedious
and dangerous voyage by water.

Lies there a Boat ready (quoth my rich Jew of Malta) to take me in so soon
as I call? No, says the other, you must wait your Mariners leisure, the same
wrangling fellow that was your first man, is your last man: Marry you shall
lie at every Havens mouth for a wind, till Belzebubs hale you* for Acheron,
(after many circumgirations) falls into the Stigian Lake (your second River
carries that name) It is the water of Loathsomeness, and runs with a swifter
Current then the former: for when the soul sees deaths Barge tarrying for
her, she begins to be sorry for her ante-acted evils, and then she is sailing
over Acheron, but when she draws the Curtain, and looks narrowly upon the
pictures, which her own hand drew, and finds them to be ugly, she abhorres
her own workmanship, and makes haste to hoiste up more Sails, and to be
transported swiftly over the Stigian Torrent, whose waters are so reverend,
that the gods have no other oath to swear by.

The third River is Cocitus, somewhat clearer then both the other, and is the
water of Repentance, being an Army of Stix, Many have here been cast away, and
frozen to death, when the River has waxen cold, (as oftentimes it does)
neither are all sorts of souls suffered to sail upon it, for to some (as if
the water had sense and could not brook an unworthy burden) it swells up into
tempests and drowns them, to others more love cannot appear in Dolphins to
men, then in that does smoothnes.

Besides these, there are Phlegeton and Pyriphlegeton, that fall in with
Cocytus (burning Rivers) In which (tho they be dreadful to look upon) are no
utter danger: If the Ferryman wast you safely, over the waters of Repentance,
otherwise these hot lyquors will scalde you. But what a Traitor am I to the
undiscovered kingdoms, thus to bring to light their dearest treasury; Sworn
am I to the Imperial State Infernal, and what dishonor would it be to my
Knighthood, to be found forsworn? Seal up your lips therefore I charge you,
and drink down a full bowl of Lethoean water, which shall wash out of you
the remembrance of any thing I have spoken: Be proud, thou Grandchild of
Mammon, that I have spent these minutes upon thee, for never shall any breathing
mortal man, with tortures wring out of me so much again. There lies your way:
Farewell. In such a strange language was this vltimum vale sent forth, that
Mounsieur Mony-monger stood only staring and yawning upon him, but could speak
no more: yet at the last (coniuring up his best spirits) he only in a dumb
show (with pitiful action, like a Plaier, when he is out of his part) made
signs to have a Letter delivered by the Carrier of condemnation, to his son,
(a young Reueller, pricked down to stand in the Mercers books for next
Christmas,) which in a dumb show likewise being received, they both turnde
back the Usurer, looking as hungrily, as if he had kissed the post. At the banck
end, when Plutoes Pursiuant came to take water, Mercury (that runs of all the
errands between the Gods) having been of a message from Ceres, to her daughter
Proserpine, (the Queen of lower Africa) finding Charon idle in his boat,
because (as if it had been out of Term time) no Fares was stirring, fell to
cast up old reckonings, between himself, and the weather-beaten Sculler, for
certain trifling money laid out about Charons business. So that the Knight
slipping in like a Constable to parta Fraie, was requested to be as Arbitrator.
The first Item that stood in his Bill, was,

For nails to mend your Wherrie, when two Dutch men coming druncke from the
Rennish wine-house, splitte three of the boordes with their club fists,
thinking they had called for a reckoning: iiij. pence.

Those Butter Boxes (says Charon) owe me a penny upon the foot of that account:
For I could distill out of them but only three poor drops of silver for the
voyage, and all my loss at sea. What Is next?

Item, laid out for Pitch to trim your Boat about the middle of the last
plague, because she might go tight and yare, and do her labor cleanly, xj.
pence.

I am ouer-reckoned that odd penny, quoth Charon, and I Will never yield to pay
it, but vi and armis, that's to say, by law. I disburst it (by my Caducens says
the Herald:) nay, says Charon if thou will defile thy conscience with a
pennyworth of Pitch, touch it still: on.

Item, for glue and whip-coard to mend your broken oar, iij. pence.

That's reasonable; yet I have carried some in my Wherry that have had more
whip-cord given them for nothing: on.

Item laid out for Juniper to perfume the boat, when certain French men were
to go by water: j. ob.

I, a pox on them, who got by that? on.

Item lent to a company of country players, being nine in number, one sharer,
and the rest Iornymen, that with strowling were brought to deaths door, xiij.
d. ob. upon their stock of apparel, to pay for their boat hire, because they
would try if they could be suffered to play in the devils name, which stock
afterward came into your hands, and you dealt upon it: xiij. d. ob.

They had his hand to a warrant (quoth Charon) but their rags served to make
me Swabbers, because they never fetched it again, so that belike he proved a
good Lord, and master to them, and they made new. Perge mentiri. Tickle the
next Minkin.

Item, when a Cobbler of Poetry called a play-patcher, was condemned with his
cat to be duckt three times in the Cucking-stole of Pyriphlegeton (being one of
the scalding rivers) til they both dropped again, because he scolded against his
betters, and those whom he lived upon, laid out at that time for straw, to have
carried Pusse away if she had kittend, to avoid any catterwalling in Hell. j
penny.

Mew, they were not both worth a penny: on.

Item, for needle and thread to darne up above two and fifty holes in your
fails, and to a Botcher for half a days work about it: vij. pence.

That Botcher I preferred to be Lucifers Tailer, because he works with a hot
needle and burnt thread, and that seven pence he gave me for my good will, why
should not I take bribes as well as others, I will clip that money, and melt
it. Not for my Bill (says the Herald of the gods) for it went out of my purse,
the Tailor may pay it back again, it is but stealing so much the more, or
cutting out 5. quarters to a garment, nay, Mercury, you shall filch for us
both, for all the gods know you are a notable Pick-pocket, as the knight of the
Post here can take his oath, but what is your Summa totalis, (quoth Charon,)
Summa totalis, answers the other commes to three shillings and a penny. The
Sculler told him, he was now out of Cash, it was a hard time, he doubts there
is some secret Bridge made over to Hell, and that they steal thither in
coaches, for every Justices wife, and the wife of every Citizen must be iolted
now.

But howsoever the market goes, bear with me, (quoth Charon) till there come
another plague, or til you hear of such another battle as was at Newport, or
till the Dunkirks catch a Hoy of Hollenders, and tumble them ouer-boord, or
till there be more civil wars in France, or if Parris garden would but fall
down again, I should not only wipe off this old score, but hope to make me
a new boat. Mercury seeing no remedy (tho he knew well enough he was not
without money) took his wings, and away went he to Olympus. The Posts iorny lay
nothing nere that path, but inquiring whether one Peerce Pennilesse came not
over in his Ferry: and understanding, because he could not pay his Fare, he
was feign to go a great way about to Elysium, thither in an Irish gallop is
our swearing knight gone.

Scarce was he out of kenne, but on the other side of the River stood a
Company crying out lustily, A Boat, hey, a Boat, hey, and who should they be
but a gallant troop of English spirits (all mangled) looking like so many
old Romans, that for ouercomming death in their manly resolutions, were sent
away out of the field, crowned with the military honor of Arms. The foremost
of them was a personage of so composed a presence, that Nature and Fortune had
done him wrong, if they had not made him a soldier. In his countenance, there
was a kind of indignation, fighting with a kind of exalted joy, which by his
very gesture were apparently descipherable, for he was jo cond, that his soul
went out of him in so glorious a triumph; but disdainfully angry, that she
wrought her enlargement through no more dangers: yet were there bleeding
witnesses inow on his breast, which testified, he did not yield till he was
conquered, and was not conquered, till there was left nothing of a man in him
to be overcome. For besides those Mortui and Muti testes, which spoke most for
him, when he himself was past speaking, (though their mouths were stopped with
scarres) he made shift to lay down an ouer-plus of life, (when the debt was
discharged at one mortal payment before) only to show in what abject account
he held deaths tyranny. Charon glowting upon him, demanded who he was, but he
skorning to be his own Chronicle, and not suffering any of the rest to execute
the office, they all leaped into the Ferry. Amongst whom, one that sat out of
his hearing, but within the reach of the Waterman (to shorten the way)
discoursed all, thus:

England (quoth he) gave him breath, Kent education, he was never
ouer-maistered, but by his own affections: against whom, whenever he got the
victory, there was a whole man in him: he was of the sword, and knew better
how to end quarrels, then to begin them; yet was more apt to begin, then
others (better bearded) were to answer, with which (some that were ever bound
to the peace) vpbraided him as a blemish. His Country barring him (for want of
action) of that which he was borne to inherit, (fame) he went in quest of it
into the Low Countries, where (by his dear earnings) he bequeathed that to
those of his name, with nothing, but his name seemed to deprive him of in
England. Ost-end being besieged, he lost one of his eyes, whilst he looked over
the walls, which first storm did rather drive him on to more dangerous
adventures, though to the hazard even of a shipwreck, (than like a fearful
Merchant) to run his fortunes and reputation on ground, for the boisterous
threatenings of every idle billow. So that his resolution set upon this rest, to
leave all the remainer of his body to that Country, which had taken from him
one of the best jewels of his life, since it had a piece of him, he would not
so dishonor the place, as to carry away the rest broken. Into the field
therefore comes he, the fates putting both his eyes into one, (of purpose)
because he should look upon none but his enemies: where, a battle being to
be fought, the desert advanced him to advance the Colors; by which dignity,
he became one of the fairest marks, which was then to be shot at: and where a
great part of that days glory was to be won; for the Regent that followed
his Ensign, (by being hardly set to) giving ground, and the enemies ambition,
thirsting after his Colors, threw at all, in hope to win them. But the
destinies (who fought on their side) mistook themselves, and in stead of
striking the Colors out of his hand, smote him: in so much, that he was twice
shot, and twice run through the body, yet would not surrender his hold for
all those breaches, but stripping the prize for which they strove, off from the
staff that held it up, and wrapping his dying body in it, drew out his
weapon, with which before his Colors could be called his winding sheet, he
threw himself into the thickest of danger, where after he had slain a
horseman, and two others most valiantly, he came off (half dead, half
alive) bravely, delivering up his spirit in the arms of none but his friends
and fellow soldiers.

So that (as if Fortune had been jealous of her own wavering) death (at her
entreaty) took him away, in the noone-tide of a happiness, least any black
euenings ouercasting, should spoil it with alteration. He was married to the
honor of a field in the morning, and died in the Arms of it the same day,
before it was spoiled of the mayden-head: so that it went away chaste and
vnbleamishable. To conclude, (father Sculler) because I see we are upon
landing, here is as much as I can speak in his praise: he died ancient in the
very midst of his youth. Charon humde and cried well; and having rid his
boat of them, directed them to those happy places which were allotted out to
none but Martialists.

In this Interim Sir Digoneis worship (our wandering knight,) is walking with
the monilesse Orator in one of the Elizian gardens, to whom he relates
(aeerbatim) his masters answer and resolution, which he receives (considering
he was now where he would be) with as few words as he was wont to carry
pence in his purse. The Post has as little to say to him, and there for
casting a slight eye (because he durst do no other, for that place is not for
him) upon all the Elizian Courtiers, (like a disdainful phantasticke
Frenchman, when he comes into a strange Country as though he travailed rather
to be seen than to observe,) up he gettes upon one of the Devils Hackneyes,
and away he rides about his other worldly business, about which, whilst he
is sweating, let me carry you up into those Insulae fortunatae, which are
embraced about with waters sweet, redolent, and Cristoline, the Tears of the
Vine are not so precious, the Nectar of the Gods nothing so sweet and
delicious. If you walk into the Groaues, you shall see all sorts of Birds
melodiously singing, Shepheardes Swains deftly pyping, and Virgins the trees
ever flourishing, the fruits ever growing, the flowers ever springing: for the
very benches whereon they sit, are buds of violets, the buddes whereon they
lie, banks of musk roses, their pillowes are hearts-ease, their sheets, the
silken leaves of willow: upon which, lest my intranced soul lie too long, and
forget herself, let me here (like one started out of a golden dream) be so
delighted with these treasures, which I found in my sleep, that for a while I
stand amazed, and speak nothing. Iam desine Tibia Versas.

FINIS.
