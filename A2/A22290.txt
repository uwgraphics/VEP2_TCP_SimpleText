By the King.
A Proclamation commanding Noblemen Knights and Gentlemen of quality, to
repair to their Mansion houses in the Country, to attend their services, and
keep hospitality, according to the ancient and laudable custom of ENGLAND
HIS most Excellent Majesty, taking into His Royal consideration, that the
celebration of the feast of Christmasse approaches, and how needful it is
(especially in this time of scarcity and dearth) to revive the ancient and
laudable custom of this Realm, by housekeeping and hospitality, which in all
parts of this Realm is exceedingly decayed, by the too frequent resort and
ordinary residence of Lords Spiritual and Temporal, Kinghts, and Gentlemen of
Quality, unto Cities and Lownes, and chiefly into, or near about the Cities of
London and Westminster; and willing to provide remedy, as well for that, as
sundry other inconveniences. Which of necessity must ensue, by the absence of
those out of their Countries, upon whose care, agreat and principal part of
the subordinate government of this Realm does depend: Does hereby strietly
charge and command, as well all his Lords Spiritual and Temporal (except such
as are of His Privy Counsel, or bear office about the Person or Court of
Himself, or of His most dearly beloved Son the Prince) and like wise all
deputy Lieutenants, and Justices of Peace, and other Gentlemen of Quality,
which have Mansion houses in the Country, wherein they and their families have
vsally dwelt and aboade; That they, and every of them, immediately upon the end
of this present month of November, depart from the Cities of London and
Westminster, and other Cities and places with their families and servants, unto
their several Countries, to attend their service there, and keep hospitality,
as appertains to their degree and calling, upon pain, not only of His
Majesty's heavy indignation and displeasure, and disablement to hold any such
places of service or trust, under His Majesty; but also of such further
censure and punishment, as may be inflicted upon them, for such their
disobedience and contempt, or neglect of this His Royal commandment; whereof,
as his Majesty intends to take a strict and seure account, so He does
hereby require and command, as well the Lords and others of His Privy
Counsel, as all other His Officers and Ministers, whom it shall any way
concern, to take order that all such as shall offend, amy receive condign
punishment, without toleration or conniuence.

Given at the Court at Newmarket, twentieth day of November, in the twentieth
year of Our Reign of England, France, and Ireland, and of Scotland the six
and fiftieth.
