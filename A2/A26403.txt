AN ADDRESS TO THE Nobility, Clergy and Gentlemen OF SCOTLAND.
NOthing is now more evident, then that the present Revolutions in England
could never have been effected, had it been foreseen, that either the King
should have been Dethroned, or that Any had Designed to make the Prince of
Orange King. When so many, out of Zeal for the Preservation of the Protestant
Religion, either actively Contributed their Assistance to the Prince, or tamely
yielded to the common Inclination of the Multitude; it was out of confidence,
that the Prince designed nothing, but what he had published in his Declaration.

It was not then known what special Agents had been long before Employed to
gain the Concurrence of so many Lords Spiritual and Temporal, Gentlemen and
Officers in the Army, to declare so boldly for the Prince; nor that several of
them had entered into an Association for that purpose: Nor was it discovered
even to the Associators themselves that any thing was Designed, but in a
Dutiful way to Solicit the King to Call a Free Parliament, and by it to Secure
our Religion and Properties: So that it is certain many, who, never intended to
improve the Success to the Dishonor of their Avowed Allegiance, were content
to lay a sleep the Doctrine of Obedience to the King, as only Supreme
Governor; and that of Non-Resistance, till they saw Popery underfoot, and then
thought to have returned to their Duty.

Others, we know, were chafed into a heat with the confident Report of Articles
Signed betwixt our King and the King of France, to extirpate Protestantisme; of
an unparalled Crime of the King and Queen's imposing a Prince of Wales, to
the prejudice of the Succession of His two Royal Daughters; and of two
pretended Inhumane Murders: And the Mobile were by Contrivance kept up in the
highest Ferment, and Animated to pull down Popish Chapels, and Burn their
Church Stuff, to prevent, as they were made to believe, a Massacre by the
Papists, till the Prince had got Possession of London, the Tower, and all
strong Holds and Ports in England; and the King was forced to Dissolve His Army
and Fly for Security.

Then the Designers of this great Change begun to show themselves more
barefaced; and a Convention of Commons was chosen of the most active Men in
all places for bringing about this Change: Some of these led by Inclination and
Interest; others driven by the fear of being reputed Favorers of Papists, or
Censured for complying formerly with the King; and the remainder, who had
contributed to this Revolution, being necessitated for self Preservation, have
laid a new Foundation of the Monarchy of England. And owning the Government to
be Devolved upon the People, have by Virtue of being their Representative, made
the Monarchy Elective; which will give such an Advantage to the Old
Republicans, that it is to be feared, none of the King's Race (whilst they
have, or can obtain Power) must enjoy the Crown longer then they please the
Populace and their Patrons.

By these Methods, matters have been brought to this pass in England; whilst
you, the Noblemen, Gentry and Subjects of Scotland, by the lateness of your
Convention, have had time to see how the Loyal Protestants in England have been
deluded; how much even such as have been Active for the Prince's Interest
condemn themselves for their Credulity, and with what Resentment and
Indignation they endeavor to make it appear to the World, how much they detest
the late Proceedings. So that it is most evident, that the King has now more
Cordial Protestant Friends in all the Countries of England, then ever he had
before; not only out of a Compassion for His Sufferings, but out of a true
sense of the greatest Injustice done to Him, that was ever done to any Lawful
King, except His Royal Martyrd Father; and in one Circumstance out doing that
and all former Precedents, in that His Nephew and Son in Law, and His own
Daughter, without any remorse, are placed in His Throne.

Besides these Considerations, they reflect upon the inevitable Calamities
which must attend so unnatural and unjust a Violence; for besides that, it will
entail a War upon our Posterity, till the King have Right done Him, we shall be
utterly ruined by the Charge of supporting this new Title, and loose our Trade
to the Dutch, or be necessitated to Fight for it, after our Navies and Ports
are subjected to them; and by this they having got an Inlet to inspect our
Strength and Revenue, we shall never be able to hold out against their
Encroachments. For I think it is now obvious to all, that the Assistance given
to the Prince by the States, and the Princes Confederates against France, was
not for Religion, but to put the Government here into such hands as might at
present actually strengthen them against that Great Monarch.

All these Particulars are now as conspicuous to you as the Sun at noon day,
and the only excuse the Army and Loyal Protestants of England have, for their
inglorious Deserting of the King, is that these things were by great Arts hid
from their eyes, and they saw no appearance of them, till the Convention had
made a considerable progress toward their new Settlement.

However, besides this perspicuity of the Design from first to last, which is
now manifest to you, you cannot have that Plea for your Excluding the King,
which the Convention here have made most use of, viz. That Popery could not be
otherwise kept out, but by making the Prince of Orange King, because the King
had a numerous Party of Roman Catholics in England; and that the King had
Abdicated the Government, and so the Throne was become Vacant: For you have at
least a Thousand Protestants in Scotland, for one Papist; and as to the
Abdication, all your Ministers of State and Justice, as well as Military
Forces, act by His Majesty's Commissions whilst He is beyond the Seas, as well
as they did whilst He was at London; and you have no Duch Forces to supersede
your actings. So that if you should now Abdicate your King, you have neither
ignorance of the Design of the King's Enemies, nor an over-awing force, nor any
colorable Plea for your excuse to the World.

It cannot be forgotten by you how great a Stain it was to your Nation, that a
Party there having the whole power of your Kingdom in their hands, and in
actual Conjunction with their Rebellious Brethren in England, sold His
Majesty's Father to the Parliament and Army in England, and how dearly you paid
Interest for the Money, which was the Price of your Sovereign's Blood, whom
they so Barbaroursly Murdered. Nor is it here to be forgot, how Zealously you
have labored to wash away that Stain: How earnestly your Commissioners then
Expostulated and Remonstrated against that Pious Princes being brought to a
Trial: How that in some measure, you did recover your Reputation, by calling
back and Crowning King Charles II. and by assisting the Lord General Monk in
that Glorious Expedition of his, from your Country, to bring the King back to
the Throne of His Ancestors; And how in later times, you stood firm for the
Succession in the direct Line, when so many of these very Gentlemen that now
Compose the House of Commons, had Voted our King unqualified for the Crown.

If you remember these Reparations of your Honor with joy and satisfaction,
let me tell you, you have now a more Glorious opportunity to Eternize your
Loyalties, and make yourselves Famous to all Posterity, by your Justice and
Fidelity to your King.

You justly challenge a pre-eminence, in that the Lineal Succession of your
Kings is derived from an Antienter Original, than that of most Nations in the
World; and though some interruptions have happened by violent Factions and
Ambition, yet the direct Line has been re-stated, and the Usurpers have been
Marked with a most black Character in all succeding Ages.

But I do not at present remember in your Histories, that at any time since you
were a Kingdom, your Ancestors ever had a more Meritorious Cause to signalize
their Honor, Loyalty and Justice, than you have in this present Juncture of
Affairs. There are no Nations in Europe, that have not had Experience of your
Valor and Gallantry in Feats of Arms; And will it not be an Eternal Blemish to
your Honor, that you atchieve so great Renown abroad in defense of other
Princes Rights, and suffer your own Natural Liege Lord to be an Exile, and
decline to vindicate His Right in your own Native Country?

The supporting the Rights of your Lawful King, and standing firm to your Laws
and Allegiance, is that which will gain to your selves, your Sons, Brethren and
Relations, Fame and Glory in the Courts and Camps of Foreign Princes; and you
and your Posterity may see your numerous Progeny rise to Honor, Wealth, and
Great Command again, in the Guards and Armies of the Greatest Potentates, when
they find you so Loyal to your Lawful Distressed King. For there is nothing in
the World, that furnishes any with such invincible Charms, as Justice and
Loyalty to ones undoubted Sovereign.

You must all be satisfied, that the King has a most indisputable Right to His
Crown; you know how desirous He is to Indulge to all His Peaceable Subjects,
the free enjoyment of their Religious Worship; You know that His endeavor to
enrich His People in Trade, and give them this Liberty of Conscience, are the
principal causes of His Sufferings; and you may be assured, that if in this
Juncture you do your Duty, to which you are obliged by the Laws of God, and all
your own Laws and Oaths (which ought to be Great, Weighty, and Sacred
Obligations to you) His Majesty will industriously endeavor to promote your
public and personal Advantages.

It will be dishonorable in the utmost degree, to have a Foreign King imposed
on you that are a Free People, and have a Sovereign of your own, for Whom, if
you now Declare and Assert His Right, you will have the cheerful concurrence of
a numerour Party of the Lords Spiritual and Temporal, and Gentlemen of England,
who even under the Power and Forces of their King's Enemies, dare be Loyal; and
the very concurring with the Laws and the Suffrages of all Just Men, will
easily restore the King to His Throne, where being once Peaceably Seated,
besides the Honor and Glory of so Great an Action, you may be assured you will
want nothing, either the King or the Just, Loyal, or Religious Party of
England, in gratitude can do for you, to make you Rich and Happy.

I know they, who think to bait you with the hope of gain, and by that means,
make you renounce your Allegiance to your King, tell you a fair Story, That
they will obtain for you the so long projected Union of the Kingdoms; but I
hope you remember how you were used, when the Usurper Cromwell granted you the
same. You got nothing by it, but the maintaining his Army, and the Building of
Cittadels to keep you in subjection; the imposing of English Judges as well as
their Laws upon you; and some of your Representatives, were English Officers
and Gentlemen that knew nothing of your Country, and the rest were so few,
that in every thing they were out-Voted. And I can assure you, from the mouths
of Great Men in both Houses of Parliament, that some do positively say, They
will never grant you the Favor to join your small Stock with theirs; and
others do ingeniously confess, That they shall never be able to effect it, though
they Judge the putting you in hopes of it, may make you more easy to comply.

I hope therefore, you will not forsake the King's Interest, which only can
make you Renowned and Happy, for an empty Shadow. It is your acting like
Persons of Honor and Justice, and firmly adhearing to your King, that must
give you the best advantages both abroad and at home The King will never forget
your kindness to Him, and you may not be only assured of all advantages you can
propose to your selves, that are in His Power to Grant, but you will have them
made durable not only for His Life, but as long as the Crown remains in the
direct Line. Nay, should it ever Descend to those who snatch it before their
time, you will then be looked upon as worthy of Honor and Confidence for
having now vindicated the Rights of the King and His Lawful Successors. For
whatever may be said or done by any who eagerly seek to obtain an unjust
Possession, yet every Man that acts upon Principles of Honor and Justice, will
certainly be better esteemed, even by such, than they who servily or tamely
concur with unjust Usurpers. For though, to gain the Point they aim at, they
offer all plausible Arguments to procure a Concurrence, yet they are sensible,
that they act unjustly, and cannot so hush their Consciences, but at some time
or other they will fly in their Faces, and tell them Truth.

You also know, that before the Prince had Published his Declaration, the King
had Granted most of those things, which in the said Declaration were marked out
as the most impulsive Causes of his Invasion, and you have no Grievances to be
redressed, nor any Security you can wish for your Religion and Property, or
desire any good Laws for the public Weal and Benefit of the Kingdom, that the
King will deny or refuse to gratify you with in a Parliamentary way.

If then you will consult the quiet of your Consciences, the Justice, Honor,
and Prosperity of your Nation, the Laws of your Land, your Repute abroad with
all Good Men, the Weal of your Posterity, and avert the Judgments of God, which
sonner or later overtake all perfidious and unjust Actions; If you will cheer
the Hearts and strengthen the Hands of the Loyal and Conscientious in England;
It is only to be done by declaring your selves true to the King, Abhorrers of
all Usurpations, and Maintainers of your Laws; which Resolution in you, all
Loyal Good Men will Honor you for: and Assist you in their Defense, and God
Almighty will Bles^ you here, and to Eternity in the Accomplishment of them.

FINIS.
