By the King.
A Proclamation commanding all Inhabitants on the Sea-Coastes, or in any Ports
or Sea-Townes, to make their speedy repair unto, and continue at the places of
their Habitations there, during these times of Danger.
THE Kings most Excellent Majesty, in his Princely wisdom and providence,
foreseeing, That if in these times, when an Invasion is threatened, the
Inhabitants on the Seacoastes, and in the Ports, and Sea towns of this Realm
of England, and Dominion of Wales, out of an apprehension of danger, should
desert the Sea coasts, Ports, or Towns aforesaid, and leaving their wonted
Habitations, or places of abode, shall withdraw themselves from thence, when
there is most use of their abiding, and commorancy there; those places would be
left as a prey to the enemies, and they invited to an Invasion, having
encouragement beforehand, not not to find resistance; whereas, if at their
first entrance, or attempt to land, they were encountered, it would be much
easier to repel them, then when they shall be landed and entrenched, or put
into Array:

His Majesty therefore by the advice of His Privy Counsel, does straightly
charge and command all persons of whatsoever quality or degree, who, at any
time heretofore within one year now last, have had or made their Residence
many of the Port Towns or Sea Towns of this Realm of England, or Dominion of
Wales, or on any the Sea Coasts, shall continue their habitations there, with
their ordinary Families and Retinue; And that if any of them have already
withdrawn themselves from their wonted habitations in those places, that they
do presently repair thither again, and continue and abide there with their
Families and Retinues during these times of Hostility and danger, for the
better defense and safety of those parts, and of this whole Realm: And His
Majesty does hereby straightly charge and command, that no person whatsoever
presume to break this His Royal command, in, and concerning the Premises,
upon pain of His Majesty's highest displeasure, and of such severe penalties
and punishments, as by the Laws of this Realm, or by His Highness
Prerogative Royal, can be inflicted upon such Offenders.

Given at His Majesty's Court at White Hall, the tenth day of July, in the
second year of his Highness Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. God
save the King.

Excellent Majesty. 1626.
