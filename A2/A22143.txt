HONI SOIT QVI MAL Y PENSE

By the King.
A Proclamation for remoouing the Staple of Woolls from parts beyond the Seas,
unto certain principal Cities and Towns within this Our Realm.
Having of late been earnestly petitioned by diverse of Our loving Subjects,
as well of the Growers and Breeders of Wool, as the Merchants and Traders
therein, and Clothiers and Conuerters thereof, to take into Our Princely care
and consideration, the due and orderly disposing of the Woolls of this Our
Kingdom; We by the advice of Our Privy Council, and Our Council learned,
have maturely examined the Laws of Our Kingdom in that behalf made, and the
Charters of the Staplers, concerning their power and interest in the Trade of
buying and selling of Woolls; And have also taken into Our Princely
consideration the conueniencie of a middle hand between the Wool Growers, and
Conuerters thereof, that joining the respect of State and policy, with that of
right and Law, We might resolve how the same might be settled most for the
public good of Our Subjects; And observing that Our famous progenitors, have
as well by diverse Laws, as by sundry Charters made to the Society of the
Merchants of the Staple, provided that there should be a continual Trade or
Merchandise of buying and selling the Woolls of this Kingdom, either within
the Realm or without, to which purpose diverse Staples have been by them
erected and assigned, as well within the Realm, as beyond the Seas, as the
present occasion of the State had required; And finding that the Merchants of
the Staple have power and authority by the Charter and free grant of Our dear
sister Queen Elizabeth of famous memory, to keep the Staple of Woolls at
Middelburgh, Bridges, and Bergen-op Zoom, which is nevertheless to be removed
and settled elsewhere within Our Land or without, at the pleasure of Us, our
Heirs or Successors, upon nine months warning given unto the said Staplers
under Our great Seal; And being resolved that it most tends to the general
good, that the Woolls of this Our Kingdom shall be wrought within Our Realm,
To which end We minding to continue and establish a due and orderly means,
as well to furnish the Wool-growers with several sorts of Chapmen for their
Wools, and also for the fit and timely dispersing and disposing thereof into
all parts of this Our Realm, where it may be best used; And for that of
ancient time the whole Trade and use of Woolls within this Realm has been
under the government of the Mayor and Society of the Staple for the time
being, (other then that which the Clothiers and Conuerters have heretofore, and
may still lawfully buy to convert,) And that the said Staplers have a
government established, both by the Laws of this Kingdom, and by diverse
Charters of Our famous Progenitors, with sworn Officers, as Wooll-winders,
Porters, Packers, Searchers, Woolshuters, Correctors and the like, fit for the
well using and ordering of their Trade, and for the preventing of all frauds
and deceits therein; By Our letters Patents lately made unto them, We have
signified Our will and pleasure, That they the said Mayor, Constables and
Society of Merchants of the Staple, and every of them shall within nine
months next after the date thereof, remove themselves, their goods and
servants, and by virtue of Our said letters Patents, We have declared for Us
our Heirs and Successors, That the Staple of woolls shall be and is removed
from the foresaid Towns of Middelburgh, Bridges, and Bergen op Zoom; And that
from thencefoorth they and every of them shall forbear to carry any Woolls out
of this Realm, to the said places, or to any other place whatsoever beyond the
Seas; And by Our said letters Pattents aforesaid, We have assigned and
appointed, That the Staples shall hereafter be kept within this Our Realm, at
the several Cities, Towns and places hereafter mentioned, Viz. At the City
of London and the Suburbs thereof, at the cities of Canterbury, Exeter,
Norwich, Worcester, Winchester, and Lincoln, And at the Towns of Shrewsbury,
and Oswestrie in the County of Salop, Northampton, and Brackly in the County
of Northhampton, Cirencester in the County of Gloucester; Reading in the
County of Berks; Kendall in the County of Westmerland, Sherborne in the
County of Dorcet; Richmond, Hallifax, and Wakefield in the County of York;
Ratesdale in the County of Lancaster, Tanton Deane in the County of Somerset.
Deuizes in the County of Wilts, Coggeshall in the County of Essex, And
Woodstocke in the County of Oxon. And We have likewise thereby granted and
confirmed unto the Mayor, Constables and Society of the Merchants of the
Staple of England, and to their Successors, and to all and singular Merchants
and others, which are or shall be of, and under the Freedom and government of
the Society of the Staple of England, full and free power, liberty and
Authority to buy, bargain and contract all manner of Woolls in all parts of
this Kingdom of England, and Dominion of Wales, of all person and persons
whatsoever, and the same to utter and put to Sale in any of the said
Staple-markets, cities or Towns without any impeachment, restraint or
condition in that behalf.

Notwithstanding the Statute made in the fifth year of the late King Edward
the sixth, or any other Law, Statute, Restraint, Provision, or Proclamation to
be contrary in any wise; As by our said Letters Patents under our great Seal
of England more at large appears. We do for Us, Our Heirs and Successors,
straightly charge, command and prohibit all and every our loving Subjects,
that none of them do Sue, Implead, or vex in any Court of Record whatsoever,
the said Merchants of the Staple, or any of them, their Wives, Apprentices, or
Household servants, or any of them, for or concerning buying of Woolles in any
place whatsoever, to sell again by Retayle or otherwise, within the Staple
Towns aforesaid. And if any Suit hereafter shall be brought or prosecuted in any
of Our Courts against the said Merchants of the Staple, or any of them, their
wives, Apprentices, or Household servants, for the buying of any Woolls, which
shall be bought to the intent to sell again at any of the said Staple Towns,
upon any Statute or Ordinance whatsoever, made against Engrossing and buying of
Woolles, to the intent to sell them again: Then and so often We do by these
presents, for Us, our Heirs and Successors, will, charge and require all and
every the Judges and Justices of Us, our Heirs and Successors, of all and
every our Courts, where any such Suite shall be brought and prosecuted, and the
Barons of the Exchequer of Us, our Heirs and Successors, so soon as they, or
any of them shall be truly certified, that the party sued is a Merchant of the
Staple, or wife, Apprentice, or Household servant to a Merchant of the Staple;
They, and every of them the said Judges, Justices and Barons of Us, our Heirs
or Successors, shall use and employ the uttermost of their power and
authority, and take all courses, and do all things which may stand with Law
and Justice, for the speedy stopping and repressing of all such Suits and
troubles against the said Merchants of the Staple, or any of them, their wives,
apprentices, or household servants of them, or any of them, for buying and
selling of Wool as foresaid. And We do also hereby revoke, and disanull all
Licenses, Powers, and Authorities which have been given, or may be pretended to
be given for the buying of Wool within this Land, either for to Ship to any of
His Majesty's Islands, or to sell again unconverted, Except such as have been
given to the Merchants of the Staple: And do hereby straightly charge and
command, that the several Statutes in that behalf made against all others
shall be put in execution: And do inhibite all others upon pain of Our
displeasure, to buy or contract for any Wool to sell again unwrought: And
further, to prevent and reform all frauds and abuses heretofore practiced by
Glouers and Felmongers in the uttering of their Felwools, We will and ordain,
and straightly charge and command all Felmongers, and every of them, which do,
or shall inhabit within twelve miles of any of the said Staple Markets,
Cities, or Towns before limited and assigned, That they and every of them
shall from time to time put to sale all sorts of their Fellwools, at some, or
one of the said Staple Markets or Towns, and not elsewhere, there to be
viewed, proved, weighed, and registered by some of the Officers and Ministers
of the Staple. And to that end and purpose, that a due and orderly government
may be established and continued at the Staple Towns aforesaid, both for
weighing, proving, searching, and disposing of all sorts of the Woolles of this
Our Realm, as may tend most to the welfare of all Our Subjects; Our will and
pleasure is, That the Mayor of the Staple for the time being, shall appoint
some one of the Society to attend the Lords of Our Privy Counsel for their
Direction from time to time, whenever they shall be commanded for that purpose.

Provided nevertheless, that the Clothiers and Dealers in New Draperies, or
any other natural borne Subjects, that shall buy to convert into Manufactures,
shall not be barred from buying immediately at the hands of the Wooll-grower,
Wool fit for their use; And also that the Dealers in New Draperies and
Stuffes, who do not use the whole Fleece of the Woolles they buy, and have
used to sell the rest to the Clothiers, shall and may continue the same usage,
as formerly they have done, so as they sell the same at the Staple Markets,
there to be viewed, weighed, and registered by the Officers and Ministers of the
Staple.

Given at Burley on the Hill the four and twentieth day of March, in the
fifteenth year of Our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland. 1616. God
save the King.
