blazon or coat of arms By the King.
We have (before this time) made known to our Subjects upon diverse occasions,
that we have received so great contentment in their general conformity and
submission to all such courses, as might best establish the possession of this
Crown, according to the right of our Succession, as it would ever nourish in
us an earnest desire to show our selves careful in all things, to preserve
their greatest affection, and to answer that expectation, which (by their
joyful manner of receiving us) We perceived they had conceived of our
government. Whereof, as we well know, that Princes cannot yield, more general,
more clear, or profitable proof to their people, then by redressing abuses,
wherewith they find their Subjects justly grieved, either in constitution, or
administration of their Laws in being, or by seeking to establish new Laws
for them, agreeable to the rules of Justice, whenever time does discover any
defects in the former Policy, or when accidents in the State of any Common
wealth require new ordinances: So seeing both these things (which are of so
great moment in a State) have accustomed to be considered and ordered (as in
this, so in other well governed Common wealths) by a Lawful assembly of the
three Estates of the Realm, commonly called The Parliament; We were desirous
to have summoned them long since for that purpose, if the Infection (reigning
in the City of London and other places of our Kingdom) would have permitted
the Concourse of so great a multitude into one place, as that Assembly must
necessarily bring with it. Which great Contagion being now by the goodness of
God abated, and likely (as we hope) to be shortly quite extinguished in and
about the said City, We have resolved to hold a Parliament at our City of
Westminster, as soon as we shall find, that the same may be done without the
peril aforesaid. In which, as God does know, that we have nothing to propound
for satisfaction of any private desire, or particular profit of our own, but
merely and only to consult and resolve with our loving Subjects of all those
things, which may best establish the Public good, with the general safety and
tranquillity of this Realm: (on which it has pleased God to multiply so many
blessings) so to the intent that this assembly of our Parliament (being
grounded upon so sincere an intent on our part) may be matched with a like
integrity on theirs, And as it is the first in our Reign, so to be found not
only worthy of the High Title it bears, to be the Highest Counsel of the
Kingdom, but also to be a President for hereafter of the true use of
Parliaments, We have bethought our self, of as many ways and means, as may
be, to prevent those inconveniences, which daily arise and multiply by the
perverting of those ancient good orders, which were devised by the wisdom of
former times to be observed in calling of Parliaments.

Amongst which, because there is no one point of greater consequence, then the
well choosing of Knights and Burgesses, who as they do present the body of the
third Estate, so being eligible by multitude there are often many unfit persons
appointed for that service: And where it is so well known to every private man
of wit and judgment (much more to Us who have had so long experience of Kingly
Government) how ill effects do follow, when such as have to do in matters of
Commonwealth, shall come to that great and Common Council, with other then
public minds, sincere, and void of any factious humor or dependencie: We do
hereby straightly charge and admonish all persons interessed in the choice of
Knights for the Shires, First, that the Knights for the County be selected out
of the principal Knights or Gentlemen of sufficient hability within that
County wherein they are chosen: And for the Burgesses, that choice be made of
men of sufficiency and discretion without any partial respects, or factious
combination, which always breed suspicions, that more care is taken to
compass private ends, then to provide for making good and wholesome Laws for
the Realm. And because it is no more possible to draw sound Counsels and
resolutions from inconsiderate or insufficient spirits, then to have a sound or
healthful body composed of weak and imperfect members: We do likewise
admonish all persons to whom it does appertain, That seeing the dealing in
causes of Parliament, requires conueniencie of years and experience, there may
be great heed taken by all those that will be accounted lovers of their
Country, That both Knights and Burgesses may be chosen accordingly, without
desire in any particular men to please parents or friends, that often speak
for their children or kin, though they be very young, and little hable to
discern what Laws are fit to bind a Commonwealth, To the consultation
whereof those persons would be selected principally, of whose gravity and
modest conversation men are likest generally to conceive best opinion.

Next and about all things, concerning that one of the maine Pillars of this
Estate, is the preservation of Unity in the profession of sincere Religion of
Almighty God: We do also admonish, that there be great care taken, to avoid
the choice of any persons either noted for their Superstitious blindness one
way, or for their turbulent humors other ways: because their disorderly and
unquiet Spirits, will disturb all the discreet and modest proceeding in that
greatest and grauest Council. Further we do command, that an express care
be had, that there be not chosen any persons Banquerupts or Outlawed, but men
of known good behavior and sufficient liuelyhood, and such as are not only
taxed to the payment of Subsidies and other like charges, but also have
ordinarily paid and satisfied the same, Nothing being more absurd in any
Common wealth, then to permit those to have free voices for Law making, by
whose own Acts they are exempted from the Laws protection. Next, that all
Shiriffes be charged that they do not direct any Precept for electing and
returning of any Burgesses to or for any ancient Borough town within their
Counties, being so utterly ruined and decayed, that there are not sufficient
Resiants to make such choice, and of whom lawful election may be made, Also to
charge all Cities and Boroughes, and the inhabitants of the same, that none of
them seal any Blanckes, referring or leaving to any others to insert the names
of any Citizens or Burgesses, to serve for any such City or Borough, but that
the Inhabitants of every such City or Borough, do make open and free Election
according to the Law, and set down the names of the persons whom they choose,
before they seal the Certificate.

Furthermore We notify by these Presents, that all Retournes and Certificats
of Knights, Citizens and Burgesses, ought and are to be brought to the
Chancery, and there to be filed of Record. And if any shall be found to be made
contrary to this Proclamation, the same is to be rejected as unlawful and
insufficient, and the City or Borough to be fined for the same. And if it be
found that they have committed any gross or wilful default and contempt in
their Election, Return, or Certificate, That then their Liberties according
to the Law, are to be seized into our hands, as forfeited. And if any person
take upon him the place of a Knight, Citizen, or Burgess, not being duly
Elected, Returned, and sworn according to the Laws and Statutes in that
behalf provided, and according to the purport, effect and true meaning of this
our Proclamation, Then every person so offending to be fined and imprisoned
for the same.

We do also hereby give warning to the Lords and others that are to serve in
this Parliament, to have special care, (as they tender our displeasure) That
they admit none to have the name or countenance of their servants and
attendants, during the Parliament, seeing such questions of Privilege have in
times past consumed a great part of the time appointed for the Parliament,
whereby the service for the Realm has been hindered, and the Subjects drawn
to great charges and expenses, by attending much longer then otherwise needed.

Having at this time been the more careful to set down a particular Order and
forewarning for preventing of these several abuses before mentioned, that
thereby there may arise at that Public and solemn meeting, such a Comely
proportion and laudable Sympathy between the honorable, just, and necessary
Laws that are to be made and established at this Parliament, and the
commendable discretion, with all other wise and virtuous qualities meet for
such persons as are to be the members and assisters of Us, in so honorable,
lawful, and necessary an Action, as may both put Us, and all our good Subjects
in a sure expectation of a happy issue to follow thereupon: We doubt not but
these our Directions thus made manifest, shall be duly observed, according to
the important consequence thereof, and the peril of our heavy displeasure to
all those that shall offend in the contrary.

Given at our Honor of Hampton Court, the eleventh day of January, in the
first year of our reign of England, France and Ireland, and of Scotland the
seven and thirtieth.
God save the King.
Imprinted at London by Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings most Excellent
Majesty. Anno 1603.
