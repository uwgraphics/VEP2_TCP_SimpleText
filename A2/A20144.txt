and other supersticious church service.

3. Re. 18.

Wherefore halte ye on both sides? If the Lord be God / follow him / and if
Baal be / than follow him.

Almighty God lighten our hearts with the knowlage of his word / and give us
grace to express our duties in our deeds
THough I well know not what ye be that wrote unto me / yet it seems / that
the reverent fear of God rests in your heart / and that ye have a good
opinion of me. And forasmuch as ye so earnestly require mi judgment whether ye
may laufully i^ outward deeds and words resemble the papists in com^itting
Idolatry at the presence of the Mass and other supersticious church service
/ so that ye reteyne the true profession of Christ inwardly in your heart:
albeit this matter has be^ and is already sufficiently a^swered and plainly
determined of late by S. Petre martyr in the treatise of Cohabitacio^ / and in
an other work (as I hear say) of S. Ponet late Bishop of wynchestre / wheri^
he reproves Hill and Petresone with other such like disse^blers and halti^g
heretics of these later dais / proui^g that no christian man may or can at all
one time serve God truly with the heart / and the devil with tongue and body /
seeing there is no drawing of cuttes nor parting of stakes between Christ and
Belial: yet will I (at your earnest request) open unto you also my faith and
mind therein. For nature wills / that a man should gently show him the right
way that is out of it: and Gods word commands every man to love his
neighbor / and (as much as in him lies) to procure and further his wealth
and salvation. And in deed (for mine own part) I am not ashamed of the Gospel
of Christ / which I profess* For (as S. Paul says) it is the power of God
unto salvation to every one that believes. And to the intent ye shall perceive my
judgment herein not to be rash / I bring with me (for a champion) the most
excellent doctor S. Auste^ / who if he made as much against us / as he does
for us / should be rolled up / that all pulpittes / schools / barbours shoppes
tauernes and warehouses should ryng of him. Such is the practice of the Devil
and his worldings / to dissemble and hyde all things that make against the^ /
and falsely to allege and rack pieces of scripture and good me^nes minds / to
seem as though they hade some show of truth for the^. This erroneous opinion
and very heresy of dissimulacio^ is not new / nor yester day spro^ge^ out of
the Hill and stone: but the papists have of long time e^braced it / and in
king Edwardes days practiced it / having this general rule / which I would not
that ye or any honest man should follow. Iura periura / secretu^ pa^dere noli.
That is in English thus. So thou do not thy secrets utter,
Swear, and forswear, it makes no matter.
But this is an old heresy (new scoured) at least of a thousaunt year old
brought in / in. S. Austens time by a certain sort of heretics called
Priscillianistes / who taught that it was no sin^e to ly with the lips to on
that was not of their own religion / so they kept the truth in their heart /
alledgeing this saye^g of David in the psalm. lord who shall dwell in thy
tabernacle etc. He that speaks truth in his heart: as though it were enough
unto salvation to speak the truth in the heart / though he lied never so often
with the lips before him that were not / or at least he took not for his
neighbor / and therefore ^hike these heretics: wha^ S. Paul said / Laie^g
aparte lye^g / speak the truth / he added these words: every one with his
neighbor / to this purpose / that it might he laufull to speak a lie to any
other that is not our neighbor / that is / which does not profess that
religion that we do.

S. Auste^ briefly answers to these and all such like obiectiones what so
ever may be made. If this opinion and doctrine (says S. Auste^) were found
catholic and to be allowed / it disgraceth and dishonors all the martyrs /
and wipeth away all persecucion and martyrdom. For by their opinion the
martirs hade done more godly and more wisely / if they had not confessed them
selves to be christianes before the tyrannes and persecutours / neither hade
they made them to be murtherours / but with lieng and denyeng the truth / they
should have saved their own bodies / and not have suffered them to have
executed the mischief they had conceived in their mi^ds. For the tyra^nes and
persecutours were not the martyrs neighbors by profession of Christ's faith /
so that they were not bounden to speak to them the truth with their lips /
which they spoke with the heart: but they were the vttre enemies of God and the
truth. If this were tolerable and good doctrine (says S. Auste^) what neded
Petre to lament his sine so bitterly after he hade denied Christ with his
mouth? Think ye he did before deny him with his heart? No / no (says S.
Auste^) he denied not his master Christ with his heart but he lamented for the
punishment that was toward him / that he had not professed with his mouth to
salvation / that he believed with the heart to iustificacio^. therefore the words
of the prophet David are not so to be taken / that a man may laufully lie with
the mouth / keeping the truth in his heart. But it is therefore spoken /
because it may be / that a man may speak that truth with the mouth / which
ca^ do hi^ no good / onles it proceed from the botome of the heart: that is /
if he believe not that he speaks: as the ancient heretics the priscillianists
and papists did (for they spoke the truth with the mouth / as others did /
but they believed it not / nor professed it in heart) and as our hillistes /
petreson^istes and other new heretics do at this present dissemble / lie^g
with lips / and professing outwardly thatvhich i^ their hearts they know to
be false and clean contrary to gods word / because they would preserve
their substance. And therefore neither of them may be accounted of the no^bre
of those that the prophet says / speak the truth in their heart. A true
christen man as he professes the truth in his heart / because he so believes
/ so will he do with the mouthspeake it to declare it. Against this truth there
may be no deceit in mouth nor heart / but he must believe with the heart to
iustificacio^ / and make confession with the mouth to salvation. For i^ the
same Psalm. after these words / He that speaks the truth with his heart /
immediately it follows. He that has not done deceat i^ or with his tongue.
These words the heretics (because they make against the^) utterly leave out.
And the other words of thapostle / layeng aparte lie^g / speak the truth
every man with his neighbor / they expou^de as the Jews do their law / where
because they be commanded only to deal plainly / and use mercy with their
brethren and neighbors / they not only think they may / but also do use
with the christianes al subtlety / deceat / gile / and cruelty. But those
words are not so to be take / as though there were non other our neighbors /
but such as be presently me^bres of the body of Christ / and profess one
religion and faith with us: but that we should take every man to be our
neighbor / whom we would have hereafter to be our neighbor / albeit he be not
presently our neighbor: as Christ did declare the Samaritane to be neighbor
to the stranger with whom he used mercy / and the stranger to the Samaritane.

And therefore he ought to be taken for our neighbor and no stranger / whom we
desire (as we ought to desire all men) to profess Christ as we do. And if
because he is not yet of our faith / some mysteries ought to be kept from such
a stranger / yet we ought not therefore to speak unto him that which is false.
For there were in thapostles time / that preached Christ and the truth not
truly: that is / not with a true mind and sincere conscience / but of envy /
co^te^cion / and with a corrupt mi^de: and yet they were suffered and allowed /
but non co^me^ded for speaki^g of an untruth with a safe conscience. And
thapostle says: Let Christ be preached / whether it be by occasion / or by
truth: but he said not let Christ be first denied / that after he may be
preached. We may not do evil / that good may follow: for if we do / our
damnacion is just and certain. But let us turn the words / because we have
followed evil / let us repent and do good / that we may come to salvation.
These heretics allege for them examples out of scripture.

As of the mydwyues of the Egipcianes / who made a lie to Pharao to save the
male children of the Hebrews / and therefore God blessed them. Of Rahab / that
made a lie / to save the two Israelites. Of Iehu / who feigned him self the
Servant of Baal / because he would destroy the priests of Baal. And of
Naaman / that said to Eliseus the Prophet. But herein the lord be merciful
to thy servant.

For when my master goes in to the house of Remmon to worship there / he
layneth on my hand / and I must bow wha^ he boweth. And so many others. But
these heretics are like Spyders / that suck poyso^ out of sweet flowers / not
like bees / that suck out the sweet and profitable honye.

For the midwiues and Rahab were not rewarded of God for their lieng / but for
the mercy they used toward the people of God. As for Iehu / he is not in all
scripture co^me^ded: no / scripture says of him / that his heart was not
right before the Lord. And the scripture says not / that Naama^ hade a
dispensacio^ of the prophet. For if the prophet would have consented to his
request / he hade had no^ authority to dispense with Gods word. The deeds of
ancient fathers and others in scripture are not written / to thinte^t we
should follow the^ in every thing / but many evil things be declared of them
/ to let us know / that were they never so holy / yet they were men / and
might and did fall: that knowi^g their and our weakness / we should not trust
i^ our own selves / or i^ our own works / but confessing our selves to be
sinners / we should call to God for mercy. To be short / S. Auste^ concludes
/ that for no cause men may lie or dissemble: and specially i^ matters of
religion they may in no wise do it. And that that is thus spoken against liers
and dissemblers / makes as much against Idolatry and wicked doers. For in
both of the^ the heart and the outward senses do not agree. And this is a
general sentence in scripture without exception: Thou hate (O God) all those
that work iniquity / and shall destroy al those that speak lies. And Christ
also says: He that confesses me before me^ / I will confess him before my
father which is in heaven: and he that denies me before me^ / I will deny him
before my father in heaven. And again. Woe be to hi^ by who^ slau^dre comes.
And again, who so ever offends one of these little ones which believe in me /
it were better for him / that a millstone were hanged about his neck / and that
he were drowned in the depthe of the sea.

Thus ye have the judgment of Saint Austen in your question that ye moved:
with whom I agree and consent / because I am sure / that this doctrine does
agree in every part with the word of God.

And therefore onles ye think your self so sure / that ye are hable to abide
what so ever cross shall be laid upon you for Christ's sake / tempre not God in
lyngryng in that land of the lords wrath / but in time come out of Egipte /
least with your ouerlong lyngryng and tempting of God / he pull away his grace
from you / as a vssel not mete to keep it / and so leave you to your self to
your final destrucion and eternal undoing.

Be not careful for to morrow / make not your good your God / as they say:
let your worldly substance be your servant and not your master / and put
your hole trust in God.

I have not seen the just forsaken (says the Prophet) nor his sede lack
sustenaunce.

Do ye not see the fowls of the air (says Christ) who albeit they sow not
/ nor reap / neither carry into Barnes / yet lack they not: for your heavenly
father fedeth them: how much more shall be provide for you / O ye of little
faith? Remember also that comfortable saying of Christ: Who so ever shall
forsake houses or brethren or sisters / or father or mother / or wife or
children / or lands for my names sake / the same shall receive an hundred
fold in this life / and after this life / life ever lasting. God is no liar /
ne yet dissembler. Of his mercy we have the promise: of his verity / the hope
of enheritaunce: of his justice / the assurance: and of his power / the full
performau^ce. We have a plain experie^ced example of the holy man Job / to
whom albeit God suffered Satan to plage hi^ / yet did he make a full restitucion
and recompense for all. And therefore leave those flesh pottes / come out of
Egipte / and serve God both with tongue and heart / with saie^g and doing /
with the outward man and inward man / that your spirit and your soul and
your body may be in every part perfitly sound (as thapostle says) and that
ye may with joy look for thappearing of the great God and our saueour Jesus
Christ. For he having made the hole man / body and soul / to serve him / will
not be content to be served with the one part / and the Devil with the other.
Thou shall worship the lord thy God / and serve him alone / says Christ. He
will have all or none. Therefore seeing all commodity must be hade at his hands
both for body and soul / let him have all the use of both as his own / and
despere not of his providence / which is the almighty eternal God / blessed for
evermore: In who^ fare ye as heartily well / as I would my self
