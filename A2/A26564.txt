The PREFACE To the Unprejudiced READER.
AS the fall of man made himself and all other creatures subject to vanity, so,
by reason thereof, the most noble and excellent Arts wherewith the Rational
soul was endued, are by the rusty canker of Time brought unto Corruption. For
Magic it self, which the ancients did so divinely contemplate, is scandalized
with bearing the badge of all diabolical sorceries: which Art (says Mirandula)
Pauci intelligunt, multi reprehendunt, and sicut canes ignotos semper
allatrant: Few understand, many reprehend; and as dogs bark at those they know
not: so do many condemn and hate the things they understand not. Many men
there are, that abhor the very name and word Magus, because of Simon Magus, who
being indeed not Magus, but Goes, that is, familiar with evil Spirits, usurped
that Title. But Magic and Witchcraft are far differing Sciences; Plin. lib. 30
Not. Hist.
whereof Pliny being ignorant, scoffeth thereat: for Nero (says Pliny) who had
the most excellent Magicians of the East sent him by Tyridates king of Armenia,
who held that kingdom by him, found the Art after long study and labor
altogether ridiculous. Now Witchraft and Sorcery are works done merely by the
devil, which with respect unto same covenant made with man, he acts by men
his instruments, to accomplish his evil ends: of these, the histories of all
ages, people and countries, as also the holy Scriptures, afford us sundry
examples.

But Magus is a Persian word primitively, whereby is expressed such a one as is
altogether conversant in things divine, and as Plato affirms, the art of
Magic is the art of worshipping God: and the Persians called their gods (...)
hence Apollonius says, that Magus is either (...), or (...), that is, that
Magus is either a name sometime of him that is a god by nature, and sometimes of
him that is in the service of God: in which latter sense it is taken Matthew.
2.1, 2. when the wisemen came to worship Jesus; and this is the first and
highest kind, which is called divine Magic; and these the Latins did entitle
Sapientes, or wisemen; for the fear and worship of God is the beginning of
knowledge. These wisemen the Greeks call Philosophers; and amongst the
Egyptians they were termed Priests: The Hebrews termed them Cabalistos,
Prophets, Scribes and Pharisces; and amongst the Babylonians they were
differenced by the name of Caldeans, and by the Persians called Magicians: and
one speaking of Sosthenes, one of the ancient Magicians, uses these words: Et
verum Deum merita majestate prosequitur, and angelos ministros Dei, sed very
ejus venerationi novit assistere; idem daemonas prodit terrenos, vagos,
humanitatis inimicos: Sosthenes ascribes the due Majesty to the true God, and
acknowledges that his Angels are ministers and messengers which attend the
worship of the true God; he also has delivered, that there are devils earthly
and wandering, and enemies to mankind.

So that the word Magus of it self imports a Contemplator of divine and
heavenly Sciences; but under the name of Magic, are all unlawful Arts
comprehended; as Necromancy and Witchraft, and such Arts which are effected by
(...)ination with the devil, and whereof he is a party.

(...) Witches and Necromancers are also called Male(...) (...)i; Sorcerers or
poisoners; of which name (...) called, who without the Art of Magic do indeed
use the help of the devil himself to do mischief; practicing to mix the powder
of dead bodies with other things by the help of the devil prepared; and at
other times to make Pictures of wax, clay; or otherwise (as it were
Sacramentaliter) to effect those things which the devil by other means brings
to pass. Such were, and to this day partly, if not altogether, are the
corruptions that have made odious the very name of Magic, having chiefly
sought, as the manner of all Impostures is, to counterfeit the highest and most
noble part of it.

A second kind of Magic is Astrology, which judges of the events of things
to come, natural and humane, by the motions and influences of the Stars upon
these lower elelements, by them observed and understood.

Philo Judaeus affirms, that by this part of Magic or Astrology, together
with the motions of the Stars and other heavenly bodies, Abraham found out the
knowledge of the true God while he lived in Caldea, Qui Contemplatione
Creaturarum, cognovit Creatorem (says Damascen) who knew the Creator by the
contemplation of the creature. Josephus reports of Abraham, that he
instructed the Egyptians in Arithmetic and Astronomy; who before Abraham's
coming unto them, knew none of these Sciences.

Abraham sanctitate and sapientia omnium praestantissimus, primum Caldaeos,
deinde Phoenices, demum Egyptios Sacerdotes, Astrologia and Divina docuerit.
Abraham the holiest and wisest of men, did first teach the Caldeans, then the
Phoenicians, lastly the Egyptian Priests, Astrology and divine knowledge.

Without doubt, Hermes Trismegistus, that divine Magician and Philosopher, who
(as some say) lived long before Noah, attained to much divine knowledge of the
Creator through the study of Magic and Astrology; as his Writings, to this
day extant among us, testify.

The third kind of Magic contains the whole Philosophy of Nature; which
brings to light the inmost virtues, and extracteth them out of Natures hidden
bosom to humane use: Virtutes in centro centri latentes; Virtues hidden in the
center of the Center, according to the Chemists: of this sort were Albertus,
Arnoldus de Villa nova, Raymond, Bacon, and others, etc.

The Magic these men professed, is thus defined: Magia est connexio a viro
sapiente agentium per naturam cum patientibus, sibi, congruenter
respondentibus, ut inde opera prodeant, non sine little admiratione qui causam
ignorant. Magic is the connection of natural agents and patients, answerable
each to other, wrought by a wise man; to the bringing forth of such effects as
are wonderful to those that know not their causes.

In all these, Zoroaster was well learned, especially in the first and the
highest: for in his Oracles he confesses God to be the first and the highest;
he believes the Trinity, which he would not investigate by any natural
knowledge: he speaks of Angels, and of Paradise; approves the immortality of
the soul; teaches Truth, Faith, Hope, and Love; discoursing of the abstinence
and charity of the Magi.

Of this Zoroaster, Eusebius in the Theology of the Phoenicians, using
Zoroaster's own words: Haec ad verbum scribit (says Eusebius) Deus primus,
incorruptibilium, sempiternus, ingenitus, expers partium, sibiipsi simillimus,
bonorum omnium auriga, munera non expectans, optimus, prudentissimus, pater
juris, sine doctrina justitiam perdoctus, natura perfectus, sapiens, sacrae
naturae unicus inventor, etc. Thus says Zoroaster, word for word; God the
first, incorruptible, everlasting, unbegotten, without parts, most like
himself, the guide of all good, expecting no reward, the best, the wisest, the
father of right, having learned justice without teaching, perfect, wise by
nature, and only inventor thereof.

So that a Magician is no other but divinorum cultor and interpres, a studious
observer and expounder of divine things; and the Art it self is none other quam
Naturalis Philosophiae absoluta consummatio, then the absolute perfection of
Natural Philosophy. Nevertheless there is a mixture in all things, of good with
evil, of falsehood with truth, of corruption with purity. The good, the truth,
the purity in every kind, may well be embraced: As in the ancient worshipping
of God by Sacrifice, there was no man knowing God among the Elders, that did
forbear to worship the God of all power, or condemn that kind of Worship,
because the devil was so adored in the Image of Baal, Dagon, Astaroth, Chemosh,
Jupiter, Apollo, and the like.

Neither did the abuse of Astrology terrify Abraham, (if we believe the most
ancient and religious Writers) from observing the motions and natures of the
heavenly bodies. Neither can it dehort wise and learned men in these days from
attributing those virtues, influences, and inclinations, to the stars and other
Lights of heaven, which God has given to those his glorious creatures.

I must expect some calumnies and obtrectations against this, from the
malicious prejudiced man, and the lazy affecters of Ignorance, of whom this
age swarms: but the voice and sound of the Snake and the Goose, is all one.
But our stomachs are not now so queazie and tender, after so long time feeding
upon solid Divinity, nor we so umbragious and startling, having bin so long
enlightened in Gods path, that we should relapse into that childish Age, in
which Aristotle's Metaphysics, in a Council in France, was forbid to be read.

But I incite the Reader to a charitable opinion hereof, with a Christian
Protestation of an innocent purpose therein; and entreat the Reader to follow
this advice of Tabaeus, Qui litigant, sint ambo in conspectu tuo mali and rei.
And if there be any scandal in this enterprise of mine, it is taken, not given.
And this comfort I have in that Axiom of Trismegistus, Qui pius est, sum
philosophatur; and therefore I present it without disguise, and object it to
all of candor and indifferency: and of Readers, of whom there be four sorts,
as one observes; Spunges, which extract all without distinguishing;
Hour-glasses, which receive, and pour out as fast; Bags, which retain only the
dregs of Spices, and let the Wine escape; and Sieves, which retain the best
only: Some there are of the last sort, and to them I present this Occult
Philosophy, knowing that they may reap good thereby. And they who are severe
against it, they shall pardon this my opinion, that such their severity
proceeds from Self-guiltiness; and give me leave to apply that of Ennodius,
that it is the nature of Self-wickedness, to think that of others, which
themselves deserve. And it is all the comfort which the guilty have, Not to
find any innocent. But that amongst others this may find some acceptance, is
the desire of

Robert Turner.

Agrippa.
AS one that just out of a Trance appears,
Amazed with stranger sights, whose secret fears
Are scarcely past, but doubtful whether he
May credit's eyes, remains steadfastly
Fixed on those objects; just like him I stand,
Rapt in amazement to behold that can
By art come near the gods, that far excel
The Angels that in those bright Spheres do dwell.
Behold Agrippa mounting the lofty skies,
Talking with Gods; and then anon he pries
Int' earths deep cabinet, as to Mercury,
All kinds of Spirits willing subjects be,
And more then this his book supplies: but we
Blind mortals, no ways could be led to see
That light without a taper: then thou to us
Must be Agrippa and an Oedipus.
Agrippa once again appears, by thee
Pulled out of the ashes of antiquity.
Let squint-eyed envy pine away, whilst thou
Wear'st crowns of Praise on thy deserving brow.
I.P.B. Cantabrigiae.

To his ingenious friend Mr. Turner, upon his Translation.
THrice-noble Soul! renowned Epitome
Of Learning and Occult Philosophy;
That unknown Geomancie do impart,
With profound secrets of that abstruse Art!
TO expound Natural Magic is thy task;
Not hell-born Necromancie to unmask;
Exposing Mysteries to public view,
That heretofore were known to very few.
Thou do not keep thy knowledge to thy self,
(As base covetous Misers do their pelf;
Whose numerous bags of rust-eaten gold,
Profits none, till themselves are laid in mold)
But studious of Public good do make
All of the fruits of thy labors to partake.
Therefore if some captious Critic blame
Thy Writings, surely then his judgement's lame.
Art has no hater but an empty pate,
Which can far better carp, then imitate.
Nay Zoilus or Momus will not dare
Blame thy Translation, without compare
Excellent. So that if an hundred tongues
Dame Nature had bestowed, and brazen lungs;
Yet rightly to ebuccinate thy praises,
I should want strength, as well as polite phrases.
But if the Gods will grant what I do crave,
Then Enoch's Translation shall thou have.
W.P.S. John's Cambr.

To his friend the Author, on this his Translation.
What, not a Sibyl or Cassandra left?
Apollo ceased? Has sharp-fang'd Time bereft
Us of the Oracles? Is Dodan's grove
Cut down? Does never a word proceed from Jove
Into the ears of mortals that inherit
Tiresias soul, or the great Calcha's spirit?
What is become of the Augurs that foretold
Natures intents? Are the Magi dead, that could
Tell what was done in every Sphere? Shall we
Not know what is done in the remot'st Country
Without great travel? Cannot we below descry
The mind of the gods above? All Is done by thee,
Agrippa; all their Arts lie couched in thee.
The Art that before in diverse heads did lie,
Is now collect int' one Monopoly.
But all is in vain; we lacked an Oedipus,
Who should interpret's meaning unto us:
This thou effect'st with such dexterity,
Adding perhaps what the Author never did see;
That we may say, Thou do the Art renew:
To thee the greater half of the praise is due.
J. B. Cantabrigiae.

To the Author, on his Translation of Cornelius Agrippa.
PAllas of Learning the art, if Goddess named;
which Prototype thy knowledge has explained;
Which Nature also striving to combine,
Science and Learning, in this Form of thine,
To us not darkly, but does clearly show
Knowledge of Mysteries as the shrine in you.
By thy permission it is, we have access
Into Geomancy; which yet, unless
Thou had unmasked, a mystery 't had lain,
A task too hard for mortals to explain.
Which since thou have from the Lethaean floods
Preserved, we'll consecrate the Lawrel-buds
To thee: (Phoebus dismissed) thine shall be.
The Oracle to which all men shall flee
In time of danger; thy predictions shall,
To whatsoever thou command'st, inthral
Our willing hearts; yea, thou shall be
Sole Prophet, we obedient to thee.
J. R.

To the Author, on this his ingenious Translation of Cornelius Agrippa.
WHat is 't I view? Agrippa made to wear
An English habit? Sure it is something rare.
Or are his Roman garments, by thy Wit,
Translated to an English garb so fit
TO illustrate him? for that thou have, we see,
Enlightened his obscure Philosophy;
And that which did so intricate remain,
Thou have exposed to every vulgar brain.
If then thy beams through such dark works shine clear,
How splendent will they in thine own appear!
Then go thou on, brave soul, to spread such rays
Of Learning through the world, may speak thy praise,
And fear no Critics: for thou, by a Spell,
Can force their tongues within their teeth to dwell.
Jo. Tabor, of St. John's in Cambridge.

To the Author, on his Translation of Cornelius Agrippa.
Does Phoebus cease to answer to our demands?
Or will he not accept at mortals hands
A sad Bidental? And is Sibyls cave
Inhabitable? Or may Tiresias have
No successor nor rival? How shall we
Then Oedipus to the world direct? If he
Do Incest add to Parricide, the are dumb,
That could predict what things should surely come:
And they are silent that knew when to apply
TO our body-Politick Purge and Phlebotomy.
How will bold thieves our treasures rob, who shall
Lost goods regain, or by his Charms recall
The nocent? The Art is by thee repriv'd:
In thee the Magi seem to be revived.
Phoebus is not brainsick, Joves doves not dead,
The Oracles not ceased: Agrippa's bed
(Like the Arabian birds self-builded nest,
Which first her Vrn proves, then her quickening rest
Has thee produced more then his equal sure,
Else had this Art as yet remained obscure,
A miracle to vulgars, well known to none,
Scarce read by deepest apprehension.
Then I Will conclude, Since thou do him explain,
That the younger brother has the better brain.
John Tomlinson, of St. John's in Cambridge.

To his good friend the Author, on his Translation of Occult Philosophy and
Geomancie.
MOst noble undertakings! as if Art
And Prudence should a bargain make, to impart
Refulgent lustres: you send forth a ray
Which noblest Patrons never could display.
Well may Diana love you, and inspire
Your noblest Genius with celestial fire,
Whose sparkling Fancy with more power can quell,
And sooner conquer then a Magic Spell.
The Author thought not, (when he penned the Book)
To be surmounted by a higher look,
Or be o'ertopt b' a more triumphant strein,
Which should exalt his then-most pleasant vein.
But seeing that a later progeny
Has snatched his honor from obscurity,
Both shall revive, and make spectators know
The best deservers of the Laurel bow.
Nature and Art here strive, the victory
To get: and though to yield he does deny,
The have got the start: though he triumph in praise,
Yet may his Ivy wait upon your Bays.
M. S. Contabrigiae.

Henry Cornelius Agrippa, of Geomancy.
GEOMANCY is an Art of Divination, whereby the judgment may be rendered by lot,
or destiny, to every Question of every thing whatsoever: but the Art hereof
consists especially in certain points, whereof certain figures are deducted
according to the reason or rule of equality or inequality, likeness or
unlikenesse; which Figures are also reduced to the Celestial Figures,
assuming their natures and proprieties, according to the course and forms of
the Signs and Planets. Notwithstanding this in the first place we are to
consider, that this kind of Art can declare or show forth nothing of verity,
unless it shall be radical in some sublime virtue; and this the Authors of
this Science have demonstrated to be twofold; the one whereof consists in
Religion and Ceremonies; and therefore they will have the Projectings of the
points of this Art to be made with signs in the Earth: wherefore the Art is
appropriated to this Element of Earth, even as Pyromancy to the fire, and
Hydromancy to the Element of Water: Then whereas they judged the hand of the
Projector or Worker to be most powerfully moved, and directed to the
terrestrial spirits; and therefore they first used certain holy incantations
and deprecations, with other rites and observations, provoking and alluring
spirits of this nature hereunto.

Another power there is that does direct and rule this Lot or Fortune, which is
in the very soul it self of the Projector, when he is carried to this work
with some great egresse of his own desire: for this Art has a natural
obedience to the soul it self, and of necessity has efficacy and is moved to
that which the soul it self desires; and this way is by far more true and pure:
neither matters it where or how these points are projected therefore this Art
has the same Radix with the Art of Astrologicall Questions: which also can no
otherwise be verified, unless with a constant and excessive affection of the
Querent himself. Now then that we may proceed to the Praxis of this Art; first
it is to be known, that all Figures upon which this whole Art is founded are
only sixteen, as in this following Table you shall see noted, with their names.

Greater Lesser Solis. ** * ** * * ** * **

Via. Populus. Luna. * ** * ** * ** * **

Acquisit. Letitia. Jovis. ** * * ** ** ** * **

Puella. Amissio. Veneris. * * ** ** * * * **

Conjunct. Albus. Mercury. ** ** * ** * * ** **

Puer. Rubeus. Martis. * ** * * ** ** * **

Carcer. Tristitia. Saturn. * ** * * ** ** * *

Drag Drag. ** * * * * * * **

Now we proceed to declare with what Planets these Figures are distributed; for
hereupon all the propriety and nature of Figures, and the judgment of the
whole Art depends: Therefore the greater and lesser Fortune are ascribed to
the Sun; but the first or greater Fortune is when the Sun is diuenal, and
posited in his dignities; the other, or lesser Fortune, is when the Sun is
nocturnall, or placed in less dignities. Via, and Populus (that is, the Way,
and People) are referred to the Moon; the first from her beginning and
increasing, the second from her full light and quarter decreasing. Acquisitio,
and Laetitia (which is Gain, Profit; Joy and Gladness) are of Jupiter: But the
first has Jupiter the greater Fortune, the second the less, but without
detriment. Puella and Amissio are of Venus; the first fortunate, the other (as
it were) retrograde, or combust. Conjunctio and Albus are both Figures of
Mercury, and are both good; but the first the more Fortunate. Puer and Rubeus
are Figures ascribed to Mars; the first whereof has Mars benevolent, the
second malevolent. Carcer and Tristitia are both Figures of Saturn, and both
evil; but the first of the greater detriment. The Dragons head and Dragons tail
do follow their own natures.

And these are the infallible comparisons of the Figures, and from these we may
easily discern the equality of their signs; therefore the greater and lesser
Fortunes have the sign of Leo, which is the House of the Sun: Via and Populus
have the sign of Cancer, which is the House of the Moon: Acquisitio has for
his sign Pisces; and Laetitia Sagittary, which are both the Houses of Jupiter:
Puella has the sign of Taurus, and Amissio of Libra, which are the Houses of
Venus: Conjunctio has for its sign Virgo, and Albus the sign Gemini, the
Houses of Mercury: Puella and Rubeus have for their sign Scorpio, the House of
Mars: Carcer has the sign Capricorn, and Tristitia Aquary, the Houses of
Saturn: The Dragons head and tail are thus divided, the head to Capricorn, and
the Dragons tail adhereth to Scorpio; and from hence you may easily obtain the
Triplicities of these signs, after the manner of the Triplicities of the
signs of the Zodiac: Puer therefore, both Fortunes, and Laetitia, do govern
the fiery Triplicity; Puella, Conjunctio, Carcer, and the Dragons head, the
earthly Triplicity: Albus, Amissio, and Tristitia, do make the Airy Triplicity:
and Via, Populus, and Rubeus, with the Dragons tail, and Acquisitio, do rule
the watery Triplicity; and this order is taken according to the course or manner
of the signs.

But if any will constitute these Triplicities according to the natures of the
Planets, and Figures themselves, let him observe this Rule, that Fortuna major,
Rubeus, Puer, and Amissio, do make the fiery Triplicity: Fortuna minor, Puella,
Laetitia, and Conjunctio, the Triplicity of the Air: Acquisitio, the Dragons
tail: Via, and populus, do govern the watery Triplicity; and the earthly
Triplicity is ruled by Carcer, Tristitia, Albus, and the Dragons head. And this
way is rather to be observed then the first which we have set forth; because it
is constituted according to the Rule and manner of the signs.

This order is also far more true and rational then that which vulgarly is
used, which is described after this manner: of the Fiery Triplicity are, Cauda,
Fortuna minor, Amissio, and Rubeus: of the Airy Triplicity are, Acquisitio
Laetitia, Puer, and Conjunctio: of the watery Triplicity are, Populus, Via,
Albus, Puella: And Caput, Fortuna major, Carcer, and Tristitia, are of the
earthly Triplicity.

They do likewise distribute these figures to the twelve signs of the Zodiac,
after this manner; Acquisitio is given to Aries; Fortuna, both major and minor
to Taurus; Laetitia to the sign Gemini; Puella and Rubeus to Cancer; Albus is
assigned to Leo, Via to Virgo; the Dragons head, and Conjunctio to Libra; Puer
is submitted to Scorpio; Tristitia and Amissio are assigned to Sagittary; the
Dragons tail to Capricorn; Populus to Aquarius; and Carcer is assigned to the
sign Pisces.

And now we come to speak of the manner of projecting or setting down these
figures, which is thus; that we set down the points according to their course
in four lines, from the right hand toward the left, and this in four courses:
There will therefore result unto us four Figures made in four several lines,
according to the even or uneven marking every several line; which four Figures
are wont to be called Matres: which do bring forth the rest, filling up and
completing the whole Figure of judgment, an example whereof you may see here
following.

table

Of these four Matres are also produced four other secondary Figures, which
they call Filiae, or succedents, which are gathered together after this manner,
that is to say, by making the four Matres according to their order, placing
them by course one ofter another * *; then that which shall result out of every
line, makes the Figure of Filiae, the order whereof is by descending from the
superior points through both mediums to the lowest: as in this example.

table

And these 8 Figures do make 8 Houses of Heaven, after this manner, by placing
the Figures from the left hand toward the right: as the four Matres do make
the four first Houses, so the four Filiae do make the four following Houses,
which are the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth: and the rest of the Houses are
found after this manner; that is to say, out of the first and second is derived
the ninth; out of the third and fourth the tenth; out of the fifth and sixth
the eleventh; and out of the seventh and eighth the twelfth: By the combination
or joining together of two Figures according to the rule of the even or uneven
number in the remaining points of each Figure. After the same manner there are
produced out of the last four Figures, that is to say, of the ninth, tenth,
eleventh, and twelfth, two Figures, which they call Coadjutrices, or Testes;
out of which two is also one constituted, which is called the Index of the
whole Figure, or thing Quesited: as appears in this example following.

A Theme of Geomancie.
Filiae.

Matres.



And this which we have declared is the common manner observed by Geomancers,
which we do not altogether reject, neither extol; therefore this is also to be
considered in our judgments: Now therefore I shall give unto you the true
Figure of Geomancy, according to the right constitution of Astrologicall
reason, which is thus.

As the former Matres do make the four Angles of an House, the first makes
the first Angle, the second the second Angle, the third makes the third Angle,
and the fourth the fourth Angle; so the four Filiae arising from the Matres, do
constitute the four succedent Houses; the first makes the second House, the
second the eleventh, the third the eighth, and the fourth makes the first
House: the rest of the Houses, which are Cadents, are to be calculated
according to the Rule of their Triplicity; that is to say, by making the ninth
out of the fourth and fifth, and the sixth out of the tenth and second, of the
seventh and eleventh the third, and of the fourth and eighth the twelfth.

And now you have the whole Figure of true judgment constituted according to
true and efficacious reasons, whereby I shall show how you shall complete it:
the Figure which shall be in the first House shall give you the sign
ascending, which the first Figure shows; which being done, you shall
attribute their signs to the rest of their Houses, according to the order of
the signs: then in every House you shall note the Planets according to the
nature of the Figure: then from all these you shall build your judgment
according to the signification of the Planets in the signs and Houses wherein
they shall be found, and according to their aspects among themselves, and to
the place of the querent and thing quesited; and you shall judge according to
the natures of the signs ascending in their Houses, and according to the
natures and proprieties of the Figures which they have placed in the several
Houses, and according to the commisture of other Figures aspecting them: The
Index of the Figure which the Geomancers for the most part have made, how it is
found in the former Figure.

But here we shall give you the secret of the whole Art, to find out the Index
in the subsequent Figure, which is thus: that you number all the points which
are contained in the lines of the proiections, and this you shall divide by
twelve: and that which remains project from the Ascendent by the several
Houses, and upon which House there falls a final unity, that Figure gives
you a competent Judgment of the thing quesited; and this together with the
significations of the Judgments aforesaid. But if on either part they shall be
equal, or ambiguous, then the Index alone shall certify you of the thing
quesited. The Example of this Figure is here placed.

There remains out of the division of the projections 6 points; wherefore
Jupiter in the sixth House shows the Index.


It remains now, that we declare, of what thing and to what house a Question
does appertain. Then what every Figure does show or signify concerning all
Questions in every House.

First therefore we shall handle the significations of the Houses; which are
these.

The first House shows the person of the Querent, as often as a Question
shall be proposed concerning himself, of his own matters, or any thing
appertaining to him. And this House declares the Judgment of the life, form,
state, condition, habit, disposition, form and figure, and of the color of
men. The second House contains the Judgment of substance, riches, poverty,
gain and loss, good fortune and evil fortune: and of accidents in substance; as
theft, loss or negligence. The third House signifies brethren, sisters, and
Collaterals in blood: It judges of small journeys, and fidelities of men. The
fourth House signifies fathers and grandfathers, patrimony and inheritance,
possessions, buildings, fields, treasure, and things hidden: It gives also the
description of those who want any thing by theft, losing, or negligence. The
fifth House gives judgment of Legates, Messengers, Rumors, News; of Honor,
and of accidents after death: and of Questions that may be propounded
concerning women with child, or creatures pregnant. The sixth House gives
Judgment of infirmities, and medicines; of familiars and servants of cattle
and domestic animals. The seventh House signifies wedlock, whoredom, and
fornication; renders Judgment of friends, strifes, and controversies; and of
matters acted before Judges. The eighth has signification of death, and of
those things which come by death of Legates, and Hereditaments; of the dowry or
portion of a wife. The ninth House shows journeys, faith, and constancy;
dreams, divine Sciences, and Religion. The tenth house has signification of
Honors, and of Magisterial Offices. The eleventh House signifies friends, and
the substance of Princes. The twelfth House signifies enemies, servants,
imprisonment, and misfortune, and whatsoever evil can happen besides death and
sickness, the Judgments whereof are to be required in the sixth House, and in
the eighth.

It rests now, that we show you what every figure before spoken of signifies
in these places; which we shall now unfold.

The greater Fortune.
Fortuna major being found in the first House, gives long life, and freeth
from the molestation of Diseases: it demonstrateth a man to be noble,
magnanimous, of good manners, mean of stature, complexion ruddy, hair curling,
and his superior members greater then his inferior. In the second House, he
signifies manifest riches and manifest gain, good fortune, and the gaining of
any thing lost or mis-laid; the taking of a thief, and recovery of things
stolen. In the third House, he signifies brethren and kinsmen, Nobles, and
persons of good conversation; journeys to be prosperous and gainful with
honor: it demonstrateth men to be faithful, and their friendship to be

danger either to be spoiled by thieves and robbers, or to be taken by
plunderers and robbers; declares men to be of most wicked opinions in
Religion, and of evil faith, and such as will often easily be induced to deny
and go from their faith for every small occasion; denotes Sciences to be false
and deceitful, and the professors thereof to be ignorant. In the tenth House
Rubeus signifies Princes to be cruel and tyrannical, and that their power shall

and put to an ignominious and cruel death, or shall miserably end their lives
in hard imprisonment; signifies Judges and Officers to be false, cheevish, and

society and conversation with good and noble persons. Rubeus in the twelfth
House makes enemies to be cruel and traitorous, of whom we ought circumspectly
to beware; signifies such as are in prison shall come to an evil end; and
shows a great many inconveniences and mischiefs to happen in a man's life.

House Caput Draconis signifies men to have many enemies, and many women;
detaineth the imprisoned, and evilly punishes them.

Cauda Draconis, Dragons tail.
in all and singular the respected Houses aforesaid gives the contrary
judgment to Caput. And these are the natures of the figures of Geomancy, and
their judgments, in all and singular their Houses, upon all manner of Questions
to be propounded, of or concerning any matter or thing whatsoever.

But now in the manner of proceeding to judgment, this you are especially to
observe; that whenever any Question shall be proposed to you, which is
contained in any of the Houses, that you shall not only answer thereunto by
the figure contained in such a House; but beholding and diligently respecting
all the figures, and the Index it self in two Houses, you shall ground the face
of judgment. You shall therefore consider the figure of the thing quesited or
enquired after, if he shall multiply himself by the other places of the figure,
that you may cause them also to be partakers in your judgment: as for example,
if a Question shall be propounded of the second House concerning a thief, and
the figure of the second House shall be found in the sixth, it declares the
thief to be some of ones own household or servants: and after this manner shall
you judge and consider of the rest; for this whole Art consists in the
Commixtures of the figures, and the natures thereof; which whosoever does
rightly practice, he shall always declare most true and certain judgments
upon every particular thing whatsoever.

Of OCCULT PHILOSOPHY, OR Of MAGICAL CEREMONIES. The Fourth Book.
Written by Henry Cornelius Agrippa.
IN our Books of Occult Philosophy, we have not so compendiously, as copiously,
declared the principles, grounds, and reasons of Magic it self, and after what
manner the experiments thereof are to be chosen, elected, and compounded, to
produce many wonderful effects: but because in those books they are treated of,
rather Theorically, then Practically; and some also are not handled completely
and fully, and others very figuratively, and as it were Enigmatically and
obscure Riddles, as being those which we have obtained unto with great study,
diligence, and very curious searching and exploration, and are heretofore set
forth in a more rude and unfashioned manner: Therefore in this book, which we
have composed and made as it were a Complement and Key of our other books of
Occult Philosophy, and of all Magical Operations, we will give unto thee the
documents of holy and undefiled verity, and Inexpugnable and Unresistable
Magical Discipline, and the most pleasant and delectable experiments of the
sacred Deities. So that as by the reading of our other books of Occult
Philosophy, thou may earnestly covet the knowledge of these things; even so
with reading this book, thou shall truly triumph. Wherefore let silence hide
these things within the secret closets of thy religious breast, and conceal them
with constant Taciturnity.

This therefore is to be known, That the names of the intelligent presidents of
every one of the Planets are constituted after this manner: that is to say, By
collecting together the letters out of the figure of the world, from the rising
of the body of the planet, according to the succession of the Signs through
the several degrees; and out of the several degrees, from the aspects of the
Planet himself, the calculation being made from the degree of the ascendant. In
the like manner are constituted the names of the Princes of the evil spirits;
they are taken under all the Planets of the presidents in a retrograde order,
the projection being made contrary to the succession of the signs, from the
beginning of the seventh House. Now the name of the supreme and highest
Intelligence, which many do suppose to be the soul of the world, is collected
out of the four Cardinal points of the figure of the world, after the manner
already delivered: and by the opposite and contrary way, is known the name of
the great Demon, or evil spirit, upon the four cadent angles. In the like
manner shall thou understand the names of the great presidential spirits,
ruling in the Air, from the four Angles of the succedent Houses: so that as to
obtain the names of the good spirits, the calculation is to be made according
to the succession of the signs, beginning from the degree of the ascendent;
And to attain to the names of the evil spirits, by working the contrary way.

You must also observe, that the names of the evil spirits are extracted, as well
from the names of the good spirits, as of the evil: so notwithstanding, that if
we enter the table with the name of a good spirit of the second order, the name
of the evil spirit shall be extracted from the order of the Princes and
Governors; but if we enter the table with the name of a good spirit of the
third order, or with the name of an evil spirit a Governor, after what manner
soever they are extracted, whether by this table, or from a celestial figure,
the names which do proceed from hence, shall be the names of the evil spirits,
the Ministers of the inferior order.

It is further to be noted, That as often as we enter this table with the good
spirits of the second order, the names extracted are of the second order: and
if under them we extract the name of an evil spirit, he is of the superior
order of the Governors. The same order is, if we enter with the name of an
evil spirit of the superior order. If therefore we enter this table with the
names of the spirits of the third order, or with the names of the ministering
spirits, as well of the good spirits, as of the evil, the names extracted shall
be the names of the ministering spirits of the inferior order.

But many Magicians, men of no small authority, will have the tables of this
kind to be extended with Latin letters: so that by the same tables also, out
of the name of any office or effect, might be found out the name of any spirit,
as well good as evil, by the same manner which is above delivered, by taking the
name of the office or of the effect, in the column of letters, in their own
line, under their own star. And of this practice Trismegistus is a great
Author, who delivered this kind of calculation in Egyptian letters: not
unproperly also may they be referred to other letters of other tongues, for the
reasons assigned to the signs; for truly he only is extant of all men who
have treated concerning the attaining to the names of spirits.

Therefore the force, secrecy and power, in what manner the sacred names of
spirits are truly and rightly found out, consists in the disposing of vowels,
which do make the name of a spirit, and wherewith is constituted the true name,
and right word. Now this art is thus perfected and brought to pass: first, we
are to take heed of placing the vowels of the letters, which are found by the
calcutation of the celestial figure, to find the names of the spirits of the
second order, Presidents and Governors. And this in the good spirits, is thus
brought to effect, by considering the stars which do constitute and make the
letters, and by placing them according to their order: first let the degree of
the eleventh House be subtracted from the degree of that star which is first
in order; and that which remains thereof, let it be projected from the degree
of the ascendant; and where that number ends, there is part of the vowel of
the first letter: begin therefore to calculate the vowels of these letters,
according to their number and order; and the vowel which falls in the place
of the star, which is the first in order, the same vowel is attributed to the
first letter. Then afterward thou shall find the part of the second letter,
by substracting the degree of a star, which is the second in order from the
first star; and that which remains, cast from the ascendant. And this is the
part from which thou shall begin the calculation of the vowels; and that vowel
which falls upon the second star, the same is the vowel of the second letter:
and so consequently may thou search out the vowels of the following letters
always, by substracting the degree of the following star, from the degree of
the star next preceding and going before. And so also all calculations and
numerations in the names of the good spirits, ought to be made according to the
succession of the signs. And in calculating the names of the evil spirits,
where in the names of the good spirits is taken the degree of the eleventh
House, in these ought to be taken the degree of the twelfth House. And all
numerations and calculations may be made with the succession of the signs, by
taking the beginning from the degree of the tenth House.

But in all extractions by tables, the vowels are placed after another manner.
In the first place therefore is taken the certain number of letters making the
name it self, and is thus numbered from the beginning of the column of the
first letter, or whereupon the name is extracted; and the letter on which this
number falls, is referred to the first letter of the name, extracted by
taking the distance of the one from the other, according to the order of the
Alphabet. But the number of that distance is projected from the beginning of
his column; and where it ends, there is part of the first vowel: from thence
therefore thou shall calculate the vowels themselves, in their own number and
order, in the same column; and the vowel which shall fall upon the first letter
of a name, the same shall be attributed to that name. Now thou shall find the
following vowels, by taking the distance from the precedent vowel to the
following: and so consequently according to the succession of the Alphabet. And
the number of that distance is to be numbered from the beginning of his own
column; and where he shall cease, there is the part of the vowel sought after.
From thence therefore must you calculate the vowels, as we have abovesaid; and
those vowels which shall fall upon their own letters, are to be attributed unto
them: if therefore any vowel shall happen to fall upon a vowel, the former must
give place to the latter: and this you are to understnd only of the good
spirits. In the evil also you may proceed in the same way; except only, that
you make the numerations after a contrary and backward order, contrary to the
succession of the Alphabet, and contrary to the order of the columns (that is
to say) in ascending.

The name of good Angels, and of every man, which we have taught how to find
out, in our third Book of Occult Philosophy, according to that manner, is of no
little authority, nor of a mean foundation. But now we will give unto thee
some other ways, illustrated with no vain reasons. One whereof is, by taking in
the figure of the nativity, the five places of Hylech: which being noted, the
characters of the letters are projected in their order and number from the
beginning of Aries; and those letters which fall upon the degrees of the said
places, according to their order and dignity disposed and aspected, do make the
name of an Angel. There is also another way, wherein they do take Almutel,
which is the ruling and governing stars over the aforesaid five places; and the
projection is to be made from the degree of the ascendant; which is done by
gathering together the letters falling upon Almutel: which being placed in
order, according to their dignity, do make the name of an Angel. There is
furthermore another way used, and very much had in observation from the
Egyptians, by making their calculation from the degree of the ascendant, and by
gathering together the letters according to the Almutel of the eleventh House;
which House they call a good Demon: which being placed according to their
dignities, the names of the Angels are constituted. Now the names of the evil
Angels are known after the like manner, except only that the projections must
be performed contrary to the course and order of the succession of the signs:
so that whereas in seeking the names of good spirits, we are to calculate from
the beginning of Aries; contrariwise, in attaining the names of the evil, we
ought to account from the beginning of Libra. And whereas in the good spirits
we number from the degree of the ascendant; contrarily, in the evil, we must
calculate from the degree of the seventh House. But according to the Egyptians,
the name of an Angel is collected according to the Almutel of the twelfth House
which they call an evil spirit. Now all those rites, which are elsewhere
already by us delivered in our third book of Occult Philosophy, may be made by
the characters of any language. In all which (as we have abovesaid) there is a
mystical and divine number, order and figure; from whence it comes to pass,
that the same spirit may be called by diverse names. But others are discovered
from the name of the spirit himself, of the good or evil, by tables formed to
this purpose.

Now these celestial characters do consist of lines and heads: the heads are
six, according to the six magnitudes of the stars, whereunto the planets also
are reduced. The first magnitude holds a Star, with the Sun, or a Cross. The
second with Jupiter a circular point. The third holds with Saturn, a
semicircle, a triangle, either crooked, round or acute. The fourth with Mars, a
little stroke penetrating the line, either square, straight, or oblique. The
fifth with Venus and Mercury, a little stroke or point with a tail, ascending
or descending. The sixth with the Moon, a point made black. All which you may
see in the ensuing table. The heads then being posited according to the site of
the Stars of the figure of Heaven, then the lines are to be drawn out,
according to the congruency or agreement of their natures. And this you are to
understand of the fixed Stars. But in the erecting of the Planets, the lines
are drawn out, the heads being posited according to their course and nature
amongst themselves.

Stars. Heads. Lines joined to the Heads. I. II III IIII V VI

When therefore a character is to be found of any celestial Image ascending in
any degree or face of a sign, which do consist of Stars of the same magnitude
and nature; then the number of these Stars being posited according to their
place and order, the lines are drawn after the similitude of the Image
signified, as copiously as the same can be done.

But the Characters which are extracted according to the name of a spirit, are
composed by the table following, by giving to every letter that name which
agrees unto him, out of the table; which although it may appear easy to those
that apprehend it, yet there is herein no small difficulty; To wit, when the
letter of a name falls upon the line of letters or figures, that we may know
which figure or which letter is to be taken. And this may be thus known: for if
a letter falls upon the line of letters, consider of what number this letter
may be in the order of the name; as the second or the third: then how many
letters that name contains; as five or seven; and multiply these numbers one
after another by themselves, and treble the product: then cast the whole (being
added together) from the beginning of the letters according to the succession
of the Alphabet: and the letter upon which that number shall happen to fall,
ought to be placed for the character of that spirit. But if any letter of a
name fall on the line of figures, it is thus to be wrought. Take the number how
many this letter is in the order of the name, and let it be multiplied by the
number of which this letter is in the order of the Alphabet; and being added
together, divide it by nine, and the remainder shows the figure or number to
be placed in the character: and this may be put either in a Geometrical or
Arithmetical figure of number; which notwithstanding ought not to exceed the
number of nine, or nine Angels.

The Characters of good Spirits.
A simple point. Round. Starry. Straight standing line. Lying. Oblique. Line
crooked like a bow. Like waves. Toothed. Interfection right. Inherent. Adhering
separate. Oblique interfection simple. Mixed. Manifold. Per Pendicular right
dexter. Sinister. Neuter. A whole figure. Broken. Half. A letter inhering.
Adhering. Separate.


The Characters of evil Spirits.
A right line. Crooked. Reflexed. A simple figure Penetrate. Broken. A right
letter. Retrograde. Invers'd. Flame. Wind. Water. A mass. Rain. Clay. A flying
thing. A creeping thing. A serpent. An eye. A hand. A foot. A crown. A crest.
Horns. A Scepter. A Sword. A Scourge.


But the Characters which are understood by the revelation of Spirits, take
their virtue from thence; because they are as it were certain hidden seals,
making the harmony of some divinity: either they are signs of a Covenant
entered into, and of promised and plighted faith, or of obedience. And those
Characters cannot by any other means be searched out.

Moreover, besides these Characters, there are certain familiar Figures and
Images of evil Spirits, under which forms they are wont to appear, and yield
obedience to them that invoke them. And all these Characters or Images may be
seen by the table following, according to the course of the letters
constituting the names of Spirits themselves: so that if in any letter there is
found more then the name of one Spirit, his Image holds the pre-eminence, the
others imparting their own order; so that they which are the first orders, to
them is attributed the head, the upper part of the body, according to their own
figure: those which are the lowest, do possess the thighs and feet; so also the
middle letters do attribute like to themselves the middle parts of the body, to
give the parts that fit. But if there happen any contrariety, that letter which
is the stronger in the number shall bear rule: and if they are equal, they will
impart equal things. Furthermore, if any name shall obtain any notable
Character or Instrument out of the Table, he shall likewise have the same
character in the Image.

We may also attain to knowledge of the dignities of the evil Spirits, by the
same Tables of Characters and Images: for upon what spirit soever there falls
any excellent sign or instrument out of the Table of Characters, he possesses
that dignity. As if there shall be a Crown it shows a Kingly dignity; if a
Crest or Plume, a Dukedom; if a Horn, a County; if without these there be a
Scepter, Sword, or forked Instrument, it shows Rule and Authority. Likewise
out of the Table of Images you shall find them which bear the chief Kingly
dignity: from the Crown judge dignity; and from the Instruments, Rule and
Authority. Lastly, they which bear an humane shape and figure, have greater
dignity then those which appear under the Forms and Images of Beasts; they also
who ride, do excel them which appear on foot. And thus according to all their
commixtures, you may judge the dignity and excellency of Spirits, one before
another. Moreover, you must understand, that the Spirits of the inferior
order, of what dignity soever they be, are always subject to the Spirits of
the superior order: so also, that it is not incongruent for their Kings and
Dukes to be Subject and Minister to the presidents of the superior order.

part in a body of a middle stature, cold, liquid and moist, fair, and with an
affable speech; in a humane shape and form, like unto a Knight armed; of
color clear and bright. The motion of them is as it were silver-coloured
clouds. For their sign, they cause and bring horror and fear to him that calls
them. But their particular shapes are, A King riding upon a Bear. A fair Youth.

Cow. A little Do. A Goose. A Garment green or silver-coloured. An Arrow. A
Creature having many feet.


But we now come to speak of the holy and sacred Pentacles and Sigils. Now
these Pentacles are as it were certain holy signs preserving us from evil
chances and events, and helping and assisting us to bind, exterminate, and
drive away evil spirits, and alluring the good spirits, and reconciling them
unto us. And these Pentacles do consist either of Characters of the good
spirits of the superior order, or of sacred pictures of holy letters or
revelations, with apt and fit versicles, which are composed either of
Geometrical figures and holy names of God, according to the course and manner
of many of them; or they are compounded of all of them; or very many of them
mixed. And the Characters which are useful for us to constitute and make the
pentacles, they are the Characters of the good Spirits, especially and chiefly
of the good spirits of the first and second order, and sometimes also of the
third order. And this kind of Characters are especially to be named holy; and
then those Characters which we have above called holy. What Character soever
therefore of this kind is to be instituted, we must draw about him a double
circle, wherein we must write the name of his Angel: and if we will add some
divine name congruent with his Spirit and Office, it will be of the greater
force and efficacy. And if we will draw about him any angular figure, according
to the manner of his numbers, that also shall be lawful to be done. But the
holy pictures which do make the pentacles, are they which every where are
delivered unto us in the Prophets and sacred Writings, as well of the old as of
the new Testament; The brazen serpent set up in the wilderness.
even as the figure of the Serpent hanging on the cross, and suchlike; whereof
very many may be found out of the visions of the Prophets, as of Esaias,
Daniel, Esdras and others, and also out of the revelation of the Apocalypse.
And we have spoken of them in our third book of Occult Philosophy, where we
have made mention of holy things. Therefore when any picture is posited of any
of these holy Images, let the circle be drawn round about it on each side
thereof, wherein let there be written some divine name, that is apt and
conformed to the effect of that figure, or else there may be written about it
some versicle taken out of part of the body of holy Scripture, which may desire
to ascertain or deprecate the desired effect. As, if a pentacle were to be made
to gain victory or revenge against ones enemies, as well visible as invisible,
the figure may be taken out of the second book of the Macchabees: that is to
say, a hand holding a golden Sword drawn, Accipe gladium sanctum, mumus a Deo,
in quo concides adversarios populi mei Israel.
about which let there be written the versicle there contained; To wit, Take
the holy Sword the gift of God, wherewith thou shall slay the adversaries of my
people Israel. Or also there may be written about it a versicle of the fifth
Psalm: In this is the strength of thy arm: before thy face there is death; or
some other suchlike versicle. But if you will write any divine name about the
figure then let some name be taken that signifies Fear, a Sword, Wrath, the
Revenge of God, or some suchlike name congruent and agreeing with the effect
desired. And if there shall be written any Angular figure, let him be taken
according to the reason and rule of the numbers, as we have taught in our
second book of Occult Philosophy, where we have treated of the numbers, and of
the like operations. And of this sort there are two pentacles of sublime virtue
and great power, very useful and necessary to be used in the consecration of
experiments and Spirits: one whereof is that in the first chapter of
Apocalypse; To wit, a figure of the Majesty of God sitting upon a The One, having
in his mouth a two-edged Sword, as there is written, about which let there be
written, I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, Ego sum primus and
novissimus, vivus and su^ mortuus, and ecce sum viveus in secula seculorum; and
habeo claves mortis and inferni.
which is, and which was, and which is to come, the Almighty. I am the first
and the last, who am living, and was dead, and behold I live for ever and ever;
and I have the keys of death and hell. Then there shall be written about it
these three versicles.

Manda Deus virtuti tuae, etc.
Give commandment, O God, to thy strength.
Confirm, Oh God, thy work in us.
Let them be as dust before the face of the wind. And let the Angel of the
Lord scatter them. Let all their ways be darkness and uncertain. And let the
Angel of the Lord persecute them.
Moreover, let there be written about in the ten general names, which are, El,
Elohim, Elohe, Zebaoth, Elian, Escerchie, Adonay, Jah, Tetragrammaton, Saday.

There is another pentacle, the figure whereof is like unto a Lamb slain,
having seven eyes, and seven horns, and under his feet a book sealed with
seven seals, as it is in the 5. chap. of the Apocalypse. Whereabout let there
be written this versicle: Behold the Lion has overcome of the Tribe of sudath,
the root of David. I will open the Book, and unloose the seven seals thereof.
And one other versicle: I saw Satan like lightning fall down from heaven.
Behold, I have given you power to tread upon Serpents and Scorpions, and over
all the power of your enemies, and nothing shall be able to hurt you. And let
there be also written about it the ten general names, as aforesaid.

But those Pentacles which are thus made of figures and names, let them keep
this order: for when any figure is polited, conformable to any number, to
produce any certain effect or virtue, there must be written thereupon, in all
the several Angles, some Divine name, obtaining the force and efficacy of the
thing desired: yet so nevertheless, that the name which is of this sort do
consist of just so many letters, as the Figure may constitute a number; or of
so many letters of a name, as joined together amongst themselves, may make the
number of a Figure; or by any number which may be divided without any
superfluity or diminution. Now such a name being found, whether it be only one
name or more, or diverse names, it is to be written in all the several Angles in
the Figure: but in the middle of this Figure let the revolution of the name be
whole and totally placed, or at least principally.

Oftentimes also we constitute Pentacles, by making the revolution of some
kind of name, in a square Table, and by drawing about it a single or double
Circle, and by writing therein some holy versicle competent and befitting this
name, or from which that name is extracted. And this is the way of making the
Pentacles, according to their several distinct forms and fashions, which we may
as we please either multiply or commix together by course among themselves, to
work the greater efficacy, and extention and enlargement of force and virtue.

As, if a deprecation should be made for the overthrow and destruction of ones
enemies, then we are to mind and call to remembrance how God destroyed the
whole face of the earth in the deluge of waters; and the destruction of Sodom
and Gomorrha, by raining down fire and brimstone; likewise, how God overthrew
Pharaoh and his host in the Red Sea, and to call to mind if any other
malediction or curse be found in holy Writ. And thus in things of the like
sort. So likewise in deprecating and praying against perils and dangers of
waters, we ought to call to remembrance the saving of Noah in the deluge of
waters, the passing of the children of Israel through the Red Sea; and also we
are to mind how Christ walked upon the waters, and saved the ship in danger to
be cast away with the tempest; and how he commanded the winds and the waves,
and they obeyed him; and also, that he drew Peter out of the water, being in
danger of drowning, and the like. And lastly, with these we invoke and call
upon some certain and holy names of God; to wit, such as are significative to
accomplish our desire, and accommodated to the desired effect: as, if it be to
overthrow enemies, we are to invoke and call upon the names of wrath, revenge,
fear, justice, and fortitude of God: and if we would avoid and escape any evil
or danger, we then call upon the names of Mercy, Defense, Salvation, Fortitude,
Goodness, and such like-names of God. When also we pray unto God that he would
grant unto us our desires, we are likewise to intermix therewith the name of
some good spirit, whether one only, or more, whose office it is to execute our
desires: and sometimes also we require some evil spirit to restrain or compel,
whose name likewise we intermingle; and that rightly especially, if it be to
execute any evil work; as, Revenge, Punishment, or destruction.

Furthermore, if there be any Versicle in the Psalms, or in any other part of
holy Scripture, that shall seem congruent and agreeable to our desire, the same
is to he mingled with our prayers. Now after Prayer has been made unto God, it
is expedient afterward to make an Oration to that executioner whom in our
precedent prayer unto God we have desired should administer unto us, whether
one or more, or whether he be an Angel, or Star, or Soul, or any of the noble
Angels. But this kind of Oration ought to be composed according to the Rules
which we have delivered in the second book of Occult Philosophy, where we have
treated of the manner of the composition of Enchantments.

You may know further, that these kind of bonds have a threefold difference:
for the first bond is, when we conjure by Natural things: the second is
compounded of Religious mysteries, by Sacraments, Miracles, and things of this
sort; and the third is constituted by Divine names, and holy Sigils. And by
these kind of bonds, we may bind not only spirits, but also other creatures
whatsoever, as animals, tempests, Incendia; Envy and Malice.
burnings, floods of waters, and the force and power of Arms. Oftentimes also
we use these bonds aforesaid, not only by Conjuration, but sometimes also using
the means of Deprecation and Benediction. Moreover, it conduces much to this
purpose, to join some sentence of holy Scripture, if any shall be found
convenient hereunto: as, in the Conjuration of Serpents, by commemorating the
curse of the Serpent in the earthly Paradise, and the setting up of the Serpent
in the wilderness; and further adding that Versicle, Super aspidem and
basiliscum ambulabis, etc.
Thou shall walk upon the Asp and the Basilisk, etc. Superstition also is of
much prevalency herein, by the translation of some Sacramental Rites, to bind
that which we intend to hinder; as, the rites of Excommunication, of
Sepulchers, Funerals, Buryings, and the like.

And now we come to treat of the Consecrations which men ought to make upon all
instruments and things necessary to be used in this Art: and the virtue of this
Consecration most chiefly consists in two things; to wit, in the power of the
person consecrating, and by the virtue of the prayer by which the Consecration
is made. For in the person consecrating, there is required holiness of Life,
and power of sanctifying: both which are acquired by Dignification and
Initiation. And that the person himself should with a firm and undoubted faith
believe the virtue, power, and efficacy hereof. And then in the prayer it
self, by which this Consecration is made, there is required the like holiness;
which either solely consists in the prayer it self, as, if it be by divine
inspiration ordained to this purpose, such as we have in many places of the
holy Bible; or that it be hereunto instituted through the power of the Holy
Spirit, in the ordination of the Church. Otherwise there is in the Prayer a
Sanctimony, which is not only by it self, but by the commemoration of holy
things; as, the commemoration of holy Scriptures, Histories, Works, Miracles,
Effects, Graces, Promises, Sacraments and Sacramental things, and the like.
Which things, by a certain similitude, do seem properly or improperly to
appertain to the thing consecrated.

There is used also the invocation of some Divine names, with the consignation
of holy Seals, and things of the like sort, which do conduct to sanctification
and expiation; such as are the Sprinkling with Holy Water, Unctions with holy
Oil, and adoriferous Suffumigations appertaining to holy Worship. And therefore
in every Consecration there is chiefly used the Benediction and Consecration of
Water, Oil, Fire, and Fumigations, used everywhere with holy Wax-lights or
Lamps burning: for without Lights no Sacrament is rightly performed. This
therefore is to be known, and firmly observed, that if any Consecration be to
be made of things profane, in which there is any pollution or defilement, then
an exorcising and expiation of those things ought to precede the consecration.
Which things being so made pure, are more apt to receive the influences of the
Divine virtues. We are also to observe, that in the end of every Consecration,
after that the prayer is rightly performed, the person consecrating ought to
bless the thing consecrated, by breathing out some words, with divine virtue
and power of the present Consecration, with the commemoration of his virtue and
authority, that it may be the more duly performed, and with an earnest and
intentive mind. And therefore we will here lay down some examples hereof,
whereby the way to the whole perfection hereof may the more easily be made to
appear unto you.

So then, in the consecration of water, we ought to commemorate how that God
has placed the firmament in the midst of the waters, and in what manner that
God placed the fountain of waters in the earthly Paradise, from whence sprang
four holy rivers, which watered the whole earth. Likewise we are to call to
remembrance in what manner God made the water to be the instrument of executing
his justice in the destruction of the Giants in the general deluge over all the
earth, and in the overthrow of the host of Pharaoh in the Red Sea; also how God
led his own people through the midst of the Sea on dry ground, and through the
midst of the river of Jordan; and likewise how marvelously he drew forth water
out of the stony rock in the wilderness; and how at the prayer of Samson, he
caused a fountain of running water to flow out of the cheek-tooth of the
jaw bone of an ass: and likewise, how God has made waters the instrument of
his mercy, and of salvation, for the expiation of Original sin: also, how
Christ was baptized in Jordan, and has hereby sanctified and cleansed the
waters. Moreover, certain divine names are to be invocated, which are
conformable hereunto; as, that God is a living fountain, living water, the
fountain of mercy; and names of the like kind.

And likewise in the consecration of fire, we are to commemorate how that God
has created the fire to be an instrument to execute his justice, for
punishment, vengeance, and for the expiation of sins: also, when God shall come
to judge the world, he will command a conflagration of fire to go before him.
And we are to call to remembrance in what manner God appeared to Moses in the
burning bush; and also, how he went before the children of Israel in a pillar
of fire; and that nothing can be duly offered, sacrificed, or sanctified,
without fire; and how that God instituted fire to be kept continually in the
Tabernacle of the covenant; and how miraculously he re-kindled the same, being
extinct, and preserved it elsewhere from going out, being hidden under the
waters: and things of this sort. Likewise the Names of God are to be called
upon which are consonant hereunto; as, it is read in the Law and the Prophets,
that God is a consuming fire: and if there be any of the Divine names which
signify fire, or suchlike names; as the glory of God, the light of God, the
splendour and brightness of God.

And likewise in the consecration of Oil and Perfumes, we are to call to
remembrance such holy things as are pertinent to this purpose, which we read in
Exodus of the holy anointing oil, and divine names significant hereunto, such
as is the name Christ, which signifies anointed: and what mysteries there are
hereof; as that in the Revelation of the two Olive Trees distilling holy Oil
into the lamps that burn before the face of God: and the like.

And the blessing of the lights, wax, and lamps, is taken from the fire, and
the altar which contains the substance of the flame: and what other such
similitudes as are in mysteries; as that of the seven candlesticks and lamps
burning before the face of God.

These therefore are the Consecrations which first of all are necessary to be
used in every kind of devotion, and ought to precede it, and without which
nothing in holy Rites can be duly performed.

In the next place now we shall show unto you the consecration of Places,
Instruments, and such like-things.

Therefore when you would consecrate any Place or Circle, you ought to take the
prayer of Solomon used in the dedication of the Temple: and moreover, you must
bless the place with the sprinkling of Holy Water, and with Fumigations, by
commemorating in the benediction holy mysteries; such as these are, The
sanctification of the throne of God, of mount Sinai, Sanctum sanctorum.
of the Tabernacle of the Covenant, of the Holy of holies, of the temple of
Jerusalem. Also, the sanctification of mount Golgotha, by the crucifying of
Christ; the sanctification of the Temple of Christ; of mount Tabor, by the
transfiguration and ascension of Christ: and the like. And by invocating divine
names which are significant hereunto; such as the Place of God, the Throne of
God, the Chayr of God, the Tabernacle of God, the Altar of God, the Habitation
of God, and suchlike divine names of this sort, which are to be written about
the Circle or place to be consecrated.

And in the consecrations of instruments and of all other things whatsoever
that are serviceable to this Art, you shall proceed after the same manner, by
sprinkling the same with Holy Water, perfuming the same with holy Fumigations,
anointing it with holy Oil, sealing it with some holy Sigil, and blessing it
with prayer; and by commemorating holy things out of the sacred Scriptures,
Religion, and Divine names which shall be found agreeable to the thing that is
to be consecrated: as for examples sake, in consecrating a sword, we are to
call to remembrance that in the Gospel, He that has two coats, Q^^ habet duas
tunicas, etc.
etc. and that place in the second of the Macchabees, That a sword was divinely
and miraculously sent to Judas Macehabeus. And if there be any thing of the
like in the Prophets; as that place, Take unto you two-edged Swords, etc.
Accipite vobis gladios bis acutos.


In like manner you shall consecrate experiments and books, and whatsoever of
the like nature, as it is contained in writings, pictures, and the like, by
sprinkling, perfuming, anointing, sealing, and blessing with holy
commemorations, and calling to remembrance the sanctifications of mysteries;
As, the sanctifying of the Tables of the ten Commandments, which were delivered
to Moses by God in Mount Sinai; The sanctification of the Testaments of God,
the Old and New; The sanctification of the Law, and of the Prophets, and
Scriptures, which are promulgated by the holy Ghost. Moreover, there is to be
commemorated such divine names as are fit and convenient hereunto; as these
are: The Testament of God, The book of God, The book of life, The knowledge of
God, The wisdom of God; and the like. And with such kind of Rites is the
personal consecration performed.

There is furthermore, besides these, another Rite of consecration, of
wonderful power, and much efficacy; And this is out of the kinds of
superstitions: That is to say, when the Rite of consecration or collection of
any Sacrament in the Church is transferred to that thing which we would
consecrate.

It is to be known also, that Vows, Oblations, and Sacrifice, have the power
of consecration, as well real as personal; and they are as it were certain
covenants and conventions between those names with which they are made, and us
who make them, strongly cleaving to our desire and wished effect: As, when we
dedicate, offer, and sacrifice, with certain names or things; as, Fumigations,
Unctions, Rings, Images, Looking-glasses; and things less material, as Deities,
Sigils, Pentacles, Enchantments, Orations, Pictures, and Scriptures: of which
we have largely spoken in our third book of Occult Philosophy.

There is extant amongst those Magicians (who do most use the ministry of evil
spirits) a certain Rite of invocating spirits by a Book to be consecrated
before to that purpose; which is properly called, Liber Spirituum.
A Book of Spirits; whereof we shall now speak a few words. For this Book is to
be consecrated, a book of evil spirits, ceremoniously to be composed in their
name and order: whereunto they bind with a certain holy Oath, the ready and
present obedience of the spirit therein written.

Now this book is to be made of most pure and clean paper, that has never been
used before; which many do call Which Virgin-paper is to be had at Mr. Rooks
shop at the holy lamb at the East End of St. Paul's Church: and likewise the
Virgin-Parchment, and the best abortives.
Virgin-Paper. And this book must be inscribed after this manner: that is to
say, Let there be placed on the left side the image of the spirit, and on the
right side his character, with the Oath above it, containing the name of the
spirit, and his dignity and place, with his office and power. Yet very many do
compose this book otherwise, omitting the characters or image: but it is more
efficacious not to neglect any thing which conduces to it.

Moreover, there is to be observed the circumstances of places, times, hours,
according to the Stars which these spirits are under, and are seen to agree
unto; their site, rite, and order being applied.

Which book being so written, and well bound, is to be adorned, garnished, and
kept secure, with Registers and Seals, lest it should happen after the
consecration to open in some place not intented, and endanger the operator.
Furthermore, this book ought to be kept as reverently as may be: for
irreverence of mind causes it to lose its virtue, with pollution and
profanation.

Now this sacred book being thus composed according to the manner already
delivered, we are then to proceed to the consecration thereof after a twofold
way: one whereof is, That all and singular the spirits who are written in the
book, be called to the Circle, according to the Rites and Order which we have
before taught; and the book that is to be consecrated, let it be placed without
the Circle in a triangle. And in the first place, let there be read in the
presence of the spirits all the Oaths which are written in that book; and then
the book to be consecrated being placed without the Circle in a triangle there
drawn, let all the spirits be compelled to impose their hands where their
images and characters are drawn, and to confirm and consecrate the same with a
special and common Oath. Which being done, let the book be taken and shut, and
preserved as we have before spoken, and let the spirits be licensed to depart,
according to due and right order.

There is another manner of consecrating a book of spirits, which is more
easy, and of much efficacy to produce every effect, except that in opening
this book the spirits do not always come visible. And this way is thus, Let
there be made a book of spirits as we have before set forth; but in the end
thereof let there be written Invocations and Bonds, and strong conjurations
wherewith every spirit may be bound. Then this book must be bound between two
Tables or Lamens, and in the inside thereof let there be drawn the holy
Pentacles of the Divine Majesty, which we have before set forth and described
out of the Apocalypse: then let the first of them be placed in the beginning of
the book, and the second at the end of the same. This book being perfected
after this manner, let it be brought in a clear and fair time, to a Circle
prepared in a cross way, according to the Art which we have before delivered*
and there in the first place the book being opened, let it be consecrated to
the rites and ways which we have before declared concerning Consecration.
Which being done, let all the spirits be called which are written in the book,
in their own order and place, by conjuring them thrice by the bonds described
in the book, that they come unto that place within the space of three days, to
assure their obedience, and confirm the same, to the book so to be consecrated.
Then let the book be wrapped up in clean linen, and buried in the middle of the
Circle, and there fast stopped up: and then the Circle being destroyed, after
the spirits are licensed, depart before the rising of the sun: and on the third
day, about the middle of the night, return, and new make the Circle, and with
bended knees make prayer and giving thanks unto God, and let a precious perfume
be made, and open the hole, and take out the book; and so let it be kept, not
opening the same. Then you shall license the spirits in their order, and
destroying the Circle, depart before the sun rise. And this is the last rite
and manner of consecrating profitable to whatsoever writings and experiments,
which do direct the spirits, placing the same between two holy Lamens or
Pentacles, as before is shown.

But the Operator, when he would work by the Book thus consecrated, let him do
it in a fair and clear season, when the spirits are least troubled; and let him
place himself toward the region of the spirits. Then let him open the book
under a due Register; let him invoke the spirits by their Oath there described
and confirmed, and by the name of their character and image, to that purpose
which you desire: and if there be need, conjure them by the bonds placed in the
end of the book. And having attained your desired effect, then you shall
license the spirits to depart.

And now we shall come to speak concerning the invocation of spirits, as well
of the good spirits as of the bad.

The good spirits may be invocated of us diverse ways, and in sundry manners do
offer themselves unto us. For they do openly speak to those that watch, and do
offer themselves to our sight, or do inform us in dreams by oracle of those
things which are desired. Whosoever therefore would call any good spirit, to
speak or appear in sight, it behooves them especially to observe two things:
one whereof is about the disposition of the invocant; the other about those
things which are outwardly to be adhibited to the invocation, for the
conformity of the spirits to be called. It behooves therefore that the invocant
himself be religiously disposed for many days to such a mystery. In the first
place therefore, he ought to be confessed and contrite, both inwardly and
outwardly, and rightly expiated by daily washing himself with holy water.
Moreover, the invocant ought to conserve himself all these days, chaste,
abstinent, and to separate himself as much as may be done, from all
perturbation of mind, and from all manner of foreign and secular business.
Also, he shall observe fastings all these days, as much as shall seem
convenient to him to be done. Also, let him daily between sunrising and
sunsetting, being clothed with a holy linen garment, seven times call upon
God, and make a deprecation to the Angels to be called according to the rule
which we have before taught. Now the number of days of fasting and preparation
is commonly the time of a whole Lunation. There is also another number observed
amongst the Cabalists, which is forty days.

Now concerning those things which do appertain to this Rite of Invocation, the
first is, That a place be chosen, clean, pure, close, quiet, free from all
manner of noise, and not subject to any strangers sight. This place must first
be exorcised and consecrated: and let there be a table or altar placed therein,
covered with clean white linen, and set toward the east: and on each side
thereof, let there be set two consecrated wax-lights burning, the flame whereof
ought not to go out all these days. In the middle of the altar, let there be
placed Lamens, or the holy paper which we have before described, covered with
fine linen; which is not to be opened until the end of these days of the
Consecration. You shall also have in readiness a precious perfume, and pure
anointing oil; and let them be both kept consecrated. There must also a Censer
be set on the head of the altar, wherein you shall kindle the holy fire, and
make a perfume every day that you shall pray. You shall also have a long
garment of white linen, close before and behind, which may cover the whole
body and the feet, and girt about you with a girdle. You shall also have a veil
of pure clean linen, and in the forepart thereof let there be fixed golden or
gilded Lamens, with the inscription of the name Tetragrammaton; all which
things are to be sanctified and consecrated in order. But you must not enter
into the holy place, unless it be first washed, and arrayed with a holy
garment; and then you shall enter into it with your feet naked. And when you
enter therein, you shall sprinkle it with holy water: then you shall make a
perfume upon the altar, and afterward with bended knees pray before the altar
as we have directed.

But in the end of these days, on the last day, you shall fast more strictly:
and fasting on the day following, at the rising of the sun, you may enter into
the holy place, using the ceremonies before spoken of, first by sprinkling your
self, then with making a perfume, you shall sign your self with holy oil in
the forehead, and anoint your eyes; using prayer in all these Consecrations.
Then you shall open the holy Lamen, and pray before the altar upon your knees,
as above said: and then an invocation being made to the Angels, they will
appear unto you, which you desire; which you shall entertain with a benign and
chaste communication, and license them to depart.

Now the Lamen which is to be used to invoke any good spirit, you shall make
after this manner; either in metal conformable, or in new wax, mixed with spices
and colors conformable: or it may be made with clean paper, with convenient
colors: and the outward form or figure thereof may be square, circular, or
triangular, or of the like sort, according to the rule of the numbers: in which
there must be written the divine names, as well the general names as the
special. And in the center of the Lamen, let there be drawn a character of six
corners; Hexagonus
in the middle whereof, let there be written the name and character of the
Star, or of the Spirit his governor, to whom the good spirit that is to be
called is subject. And about this character, let there be placed so many
characters of five corners, Pontagonus
as the spirits we would call together at once. And if we shall call only one
spirit, nevertheless there shall be made four Pentagones, wherein the name of
the spirit or spirits, with their characters, is to be written. Now this table
ought to be composed when the Moon is increasing, on those days and hours
which then agree to the spirit. And if we take a fortunate star herewith, it
will be the better. Which Table being made in this manner, it is to be
consecrated according to the rules above delivered.

And this is the way of making the general Table, serving for the invocation of
all good spirits whatsoever. Nevertheless we may make special Tables congruent
to every spirit, by the rule which we have above spoken of concerning holy
Pentacles.

And now we will declare unto you another Rite more easy to perform this
thing: that is to say, let the man that is to receive an Oracle from the good
spirits, be chaste, pure, and confessed. Then a place being prepared pure and
clean, and covered every where with white linen, on the Lords day in the new of
the Moon let him enter into that place, clothed with clean white garments; and
let him exorcize the place, and bless it, and make a Circle therein with a
sanctified cole; and let there be written in the uttermost part of the Circle
the names of the Angels, and in the inner part thereof let there be written the
mighty names of God: and let him place within the Circle, at the four angles of
the world, the Censers for the perfumes. Then let him enter the place fasting,
and washed, and let him begin to pray toward the east this whole Psalm: Psalm.
119.
Beati immaculati in via, etc. Blessed are the undefiled in the way, etc. by
perfuming; and in the end deprecating the Angels, by the said divine names,
that they will daign to discover and reveal that which he desires: and that
let him do six days, continuing washed and fasting. And on the seventh day,
which is the Sabbath, let him, being washed and fasting, enter the Circle, and
perfume it, and anoint himself with holy anointing oil, by annoynting his
forehead, and upon both his eyes, and in the palms of his hands, and upon his
feet. Then upon his knees let him say the Psalm aforesaid, with Divine and
Angelical names. Which being said, let him arise, let him begin to walk about
in a Circle within the said Circle from the east to the west, until he is
wearied with a dizziness of his brain: let him fall down in the Circle, and
there he may rest; and forthwith he shall be wrapped up in an ecstasie, and a
spirit will appear unto him, which will inform him of all things. We must
observe also, that in the Circle there ought to be four holy candles burning at
the four parts of the world, which ought not to want light for the space of a
whole week. And the manner of fasting must be such, that he abstain from all
things having a life of Sense, and from those which do proceed from them: and
let him only drink pure running water: neither let him take any food till the
going down of the sun. And let the perfume and the holy anointing oil be made,
as is set forth in Exodus and the other holy books of the Bible. It is also to
be observed, that always as often as he enters into the Circle, he has upon
his forehead a golden lamen, upon which there must be written the name
Tetragrammaton, as we have before spoken.

But natural things, and their commixtures, do also belong unto us, and are
conducing to receive Oracles from any spirit by a dream: which are either
Perfumes, Unctions, and Meats or Drinks: which you may understand in our first
book of Occult Philosophy.

But he that is willing always and readily to receive the Oracles of a Dream,
let him make unto himself a Ring of the Sun or of Saturn for this purpose.
There is also an Image to be made, of excellent efficacy and power to work
this effect; which being put under his head when he goes to sleep, does
effectually give true dreams of what thing soever the mind has before
determined or consulted on. The Tables of Numbers do likewise confer to receive
an Oracle, being duly formed under their own Constellations. And these things
thou may know in the third book of Occult Philosophy,

Holy Tables and Papers do also serve to this effect, being specially composed
and consecrated; such as is the Almad(...) of Solomon, and the Table of the
Revolution of the name Tetragrammaton. And those things which are of this
kind, and written unto these things, out of diverse figures, numbers, holy
pictures, with the inscriptions of the holy names of God and of Angels; the
composition whereof is taken out of diverse places of the holy Scriptures,
Psalms, and Versicles, and other certain promises of the divine Revelation and
Prophecies.

To the same effect do conduce holy prayers and imprecations, as well unto God,
as to the holy Angels and Heroes: the imprecations of which prayers are to be
composed as we have before shown, according to some religious similitude of
Miracles, Graces, and the like, making mention of those things which we intend
to do: as, out of the old Testament, of the dream of Jacob, Joseph, Pharaoh,
Daniel, and Nebuchadnezzar: if out of the New Testament, of the dream of Joseph
the husband of the virgin Mary; of the dream of the three Wisemen; of John the
Evangelist sleeping upon the breast of our Lord: and whatsoever of the like
kind can be found in Religion, Miracles, and Revelations; as, the revelation
of the Cross to Helen, the revelations of Constantine and Charles the Great,
the revelations of Bridget, Cyril, Methodius, Mechtild, Joachim, Merhir, and
suchlike. According to which let the deprecations be composed, if when he
goes to sleep it be with a firm intention: and the rest well disposing
themselves, let them pray devoutly, and without doubt they will afford a
powerful effect.

Now he that knows how to compose those things which we have now spoken of,
he shall receive the most true Oracles of dreams. And this he shall do; observe
those things which in the second book of Occult Philosophy are directed
concerning this thing. He that is desirous therefore to receive an Oracle, let
him abstain from supper and from drink, and be otherwise well disposed, his
brain being free from turbulent vapors; let him also have his bedchamber fair
and clean, exorcised and consecrated if he will; then let him perfume the same
with some convenient fumigation; and let him anoint his temples with some
unguent efficatious hereunto, and put a ring upon his finger, of the things
above spoken of: let him take either some image, or holy table, or holy paper,
and place the same under his head: then having made a devout prayer, let him go
unto his bed, and meditating upon that thing which he desires to know, let him
so sleep; for so shall he receive a most certain and undoubted oracle by a
dream, when the Moon goes through that sign which was in the ninth House of
his nativity, and also when she goes through the sign of the ninth House of
the Revolution of his nativity; and when she is in the ninth sign from the
sign of perfection. And this is the way and means whereby we may obtain all
Sciences and Arts whatsoever, suddenly and perfectly, with a true Illumination
of our understanding; although all inferior familiar Spirits whatsoever do
conduce to this effect; and sometimes also evil Spirits sensibly informing us
Intrinsecally or Extrinsecally.

But if we would call any evil Spirit to the Circle, it first behooves us to
consider, and to know his nature, to which of the Planets it agrees, and what
Offices are distributed to him from the Planet; and being known, let there be
sought out a place fit and proper for his invocation, according to the nature
of the Planet, and the quality of the Offices of the said Spirit, as near as
the same may be done: as, if their power be over the Sea, Rivers or Floods,
then let the place be chosen in the Shore; and so of the rest. Then let there
be chosen a convenient time, both for the quality of the Air, serene, clear,
quiet, and fitting for the Spirits to assume bodies; as also of the quality and
nature of the Planet, and of the Spirit, as to wit, on his day, or the time
wherein he rules: he may be fortunate or unfortunate, sometimes of the day,
and sometimes of the night, as the Stars and Spirits do require. These things
being considered, let there be a Circle framed in the place elected, as well for
the defense of the Invocant, as for the confirmation of the Spirit. And in the
Circle it self there are to be written the divine general names, and those
things which do yield defense unto us; and with them, those divine names which
do rule this Planet, and the Offices of the Spirit himself; there shall also be
written therein, the names of the good Spirits which bear rule, and are able to
bind and constrain that Spirit which we intend to call. And if we will any
more fortify and strengthen out Circle, we may add Characters and Pentacles
agreeing to the work; then also if we will, we may either within or without the
Circle, frame an angular figure, with the inscription of such convenient
numbers, as are congruent amongst themselves to our work; which are also to be
known, according to manner of numbers and figures: of which in the second book
of Occult Philosophy it is sufficiently spoken. Furthermore, he is to be
provided of lights, perfumes, unguents and medicines, compounded according to
the nature of the Planet and Spirit; which do partly agree with the Spirit, by
reason of their natural and celestial virtue; and partly are exhibited to the
Spirit for religious and superstitious worship. Then he must be furnished with
holy and consecrated things, necessary as well for the defense of the Invocant,
and his fellows, as also serving for bonds to bind and constrain the Spirits;
such as are either holy Papers, Lamens, Pictures, Pentacles, Swords, Scepters,
Garments of convenient matter and color, and things of the like sort. Then
when all these things are provided, and the Master and his fellows being in the
Circle, in the first place let him consecrate the Circle, and all those things
which he uses; which being performed with a convenient gesture and
countenance, let him begin to pray with a loud voice, after this manner. First
let him make an Oration unto God, and then let him entreat the good Spirits:
and if he will read any Prayers, Psalms, or Gospels for his defense, they ought
to take the first place. After these Prayers and Orations are said, then let
him begin to invocate the Spirit which he desires, with a gentle and loving
Enchantment, to all the coasts of the World, with the commemoration of his own
Authority and power. And then let him rest a little, looking about him, to see
if any Spirit do appear; which if he delay, then let him repeat his invocation,
is above said, until he has done it three times; and if the Spirit be
pertinacious, obstinate, and will not appear, then let him begin to conjure
with divine power; so also that the conjurations and all his commemorations do
agree with the Nature and Offices of the Spirit himself; and reiterate the same
three times, from stronger to stronger, using Objurgations, Contumelies,
Cursings, and Punishments, and suspension from his Office and Power, and the
like.

And after all the courses are finished, then cease a little; and if any Spirit
shall appear, let the Invocant turn himself toward the Spirit, and
courteously receive him, and earnestly entreating him, let him first require
his name, and if he be called by any other name: and then proceeding further,
let him ask him whatsoever he will: and if in any thing the Spirit shall show
himself obstinate or lying, let him be bound by convenient conjurations: and if
you doubt of any lie, make without the Circle with the consecrated Sword, the
figure of a triangle or A Character with five corners.
Pentagone, and compel the Spirit to enter into it: and if thou receivest any
promise which thou would have to be confirmed with an Oath, let him stretch
the sword out of the Circle, and swear the Spirit, by laying his hand upon the
sword. Then having obtained of the Spirit that which you desire, or are
otherwise contented, license him to depart with courteous words, giving command
unto him, that he do no hurt: and if he will not depart, compel him by powerful
conjurations; and if need require, expel him by Exorcisms, and by making
contrary fumigations. And when he is departed, go not out of the Circle, but
make a stay, making prayer, and giving of thanks unto God and the good Angels,
and also praying for your defense and conservation: and then all those things
being orderly performed, you may depart.

But if your hope be frustrated, and no Spirit will appear, yet for this do not
despair; but leaving the Circle, return again at other times, doing as before.
And if you shall judge that you have erred in any thing, then you shall amend
by adding or diminishing; for the constancy of Reiteration does often increase
your authority and power, and strikes terror into the Spirits, and humbles
them to obey.

And therefore some use to make a Gate in the Circle, whereby they may go in
and out, which they open and shut as they please, and fortify it with holy
Names and Pentacles.

This also we are to take notice of, That when no Spirits will appear, but the
Master being wearied has determined to cease and give over; let him not
therefore depart without licensing the Spirits: for they that do neglect this,
are very greatly in danger, except they are fortified with some sublime defense.

Oftentimes also the Spirits do come, although they appear not visible, (for to
cause terror to him that calls them) either in the thing which he uses, or in
the operation it self. But this kind of licensing is not given simply, but by
a kind of dispensation with suspension, until in the following terms they
shall render themselves obedient. Also without a Circle these Spirits may be
called to appear, according to the way which is above delivered about the
consecration of a Book.

But when we do intend to execute any effect by evil Spirits, where an
Apparition is not needful; then that is to be done, by making and forming that
which is to be unto us as an instrument, or subject of the experiment it self;
as whether it be an Image, or a Ring, or a Writing, or any Character, Candle,
or Sacrifice, or any thing of the like sort; then the name of the Spirit is to
be written therein, with his Character, according to the exigency of the
experiment, either by writing it with some blood, or otherwise using a perfume
agreeable to the Spirit. Oftentimes also making Prayers and Orations to God and
the good Angels before we invocate the evil Spirit, conjuring him by the divine
power.

There is another kind of Spirits which we have spoken of in our third book of
Occult Philosophy, not so hurtful, and nearest men; so also, that they are
affected with humane passions, and do joy in the conversation of men, and
freely do inhabit with them: and others do dwell in the Woods and Deserts; and
others delight in the company of diverse domestique Animals and wild Beasts;
and othersom do inhabit about Fountains and Meadows. Whosoever therefore would
call up these kind of Spirits, in the place where they abide, it ought to be
done with odoriferous perfumes, and with sweet sounds and instruments of
Music, specially composed for the business, with using of Songs, Enchantments
and pleasant Verses, with praises and promises.

But those which are obstinate to yield to these things, are to be compelled
with Threatenings, Comminations, Cursings, Delusions, Contumelies, and
especially by threatening them to expel them from those places where they are
conversant.

Further, if need be, thou may betake thee to use Exorcisms; but the chiefest
thing that ought to be observed, is, constancy of mind, and boldness, free and
alienated from fear.

Lastly, when you would invocate these kind of Spirits, you ought to prepare a
Table in the place of invocation, covered with clean linen; whereupon you shall
set new bread, and running water or milk in new earthen vessels, and new
knives. And you shall make a fire, whereupon a purfume shall be made. But let
the Invocant go unto the head of the Table, and round about it let there be
seats placed for the Spirits, as you please; and the Spirits being called, you
shall invite them to drink and eat. But if perchance you shall fear any evil
Spirit, then draw a Circle about it, and let that part of the Table at which
the Invocant sits, be within the Circle, and the rest of the Table without the
Circle.

In our third book of Occult Philosophy, we have taught how and by what means
the Soul is joined to the Body; and, what happens to the soul after death.

Thou may know further, That those Souls do still love their relinquished
Bodies after death, as it were a certain affinity alluring them; such as are
the Souls of noxious men, which have violently relinquished their Bodies, and
Souls wanting a due burial, which do still wander in a liquid and turbulent
Spirits about their dead carcasses; for these Souls by the known means by
which heretofore they were conjoined to their Bodies, by the like vapors,
liquors, and savours, are easily drawn unto them.

From hence it is, that the Souls of the dead are not to be called up without
blood, or by the application of some part of their relict Body.

In the raising up of these shadows, we are to perfume with new Blood, with the
Bones of the dead, and with Flesh, Eggs, Milk, Honey and Oil, and suchlike
things, which do attribute to the Souls a means apt to receive their Bodies.

It is also to be understood, That those who are desirous to raise up any Souls
of the dead, they ought to do it in those places, wherein these kind of Souls
are most known to be conversant; or for some alliance alluring those souls into
their forsaken body; or for some kind of affection in times past, impressed in
them in their life, drawing the said Souls to certain places, things, or
persons; or for the forcible nature of some place fitted and prepared for to
purge or punish these souls. Which places for the most part are to be known by
the experience of visions, nightly incursions, and apparitions, and suchlike
prodigies seen.

Therefore the places most fitting for these things, are Churchyards. And
better then them, are those places wherein there is the execution of criminal
judgments. And better then these, are those places, in which of late years
there have been some public slaughters of men. Furthermore, that place is
better then these, where some dead carcass, that came by violent death, is not
yet expiated, nor ritely buried, and was lately buried; for the expiation of
those places, is also a holy Rite duly to be adhibited to the burial of the
bodies, and oftentimes prohibiteth the souls to come unto their bodies, and
expels them far off unto the places of judgment.

And from hence it is, That the Souls of the dead are not easily to be raised
up, except it be the Souls of them whom we know to be evil, or to have perished
by a violent death, and whose bodies do want a right and due burial.

Now although we have spoken concerning such places of this kind, it will not
be safe or commodious to go unto them: but it behooves us to take to what place
soever is to be chosen, some principal part of the body that is relict, and
therewith to make a perfume in due manner, and to perform other competent
Rites.

It is also to be known, that because the Souls are certain spiritual lights,
therefore artificial lights, especially if they be framed out of certain
competent things, compounded according to a true rule, with congruent
inscriptions of Names and Seals, do very much avail to the raising up of
departed Souls.

Moreover, these things which are now spoken of, are not always sufficient to
raise up Souls, because of an extranatural portion of understanding and reason,
which is above, and known only to the Heaven and Destinies, and their power.

We ought therefore to allure the said Souls, by supernatural and celestial
powers duly administered, even by those things which do move the very harmony
of the Soul, as well imaginative, as rational and intellectual; as are Voices,
Songs, Sounds, Enchantments: and Religious things; as Prayers, Conjurations,
Exorcismes, and other holy Rites, which may very commodiously be administered
hereunto.

The end of the fourth book of Agrippa.
Heptameron: OR, MAGICAL ELEMENTS OF PETER de ABANO PHILOSOPHER.
IN the former book, which is the fourth book of Agrippa, it is sufficiently
spoken concerning Magical Ceremonies, and Initiations.

But because he seems to have written to the learned, and well-experienced in
this Art; because he does not specially treat of the Ceremonies, but rather
speaks of them in general, it was therefore thought good to add hereunto the
Magical Elements of Peter de Abano: that those who are hitherto ignorant, and
have not tasted of Magical Superstitions, may have them in readiness, how they
may exercise themselves therein. For we see in this book, as it were a certain
introduction of Magical vanity; and as it were in present exercise, they may
behold the distinct functions of spirits, how they may be drawn to discourse
and communication; what is to be done every day, and every hour; and how they
shall be read, as if they were described syllable by syllable.

In brief, in this book are kept the principles of Magical conveyances. But
decause the greatest power is attributed to the Circles; (For they are certain
fortresses to defend the operators safe from the evil Spirits;) In the first
place we will treat concerning the composition of a Circle.

Of the Circle, and the composition thereof.
THe form of Circles is not always one and the same; but uses to be changed,
according to the order of the Spirits that are to be called, their places,
times, days and hours. For in making a Circle, it ought to be considered in
what time of the year, what day, and what hour, that you make the Circle; what
Spirits you would call, to what Star and Region they do belong, and what
functions they have. Therefore let there be made three Circles of the latitude
of nine foot, and let them be distant one from another a hands breadth; and in
the middle Circle, first, write the name of the hour wherein you do the work.
In the second place, Write the name of the Angel of the hour. In the third
place, The sigil of the Angel of the hour. Fourthly, The name of the Angel that
rules that day wherein you do the work, and the names of his Ministers. In the
fifth place, The name of the present time. Sixthly, The name of the Spirits
ruling in that part of time, and their Presidents. Seventhly, The name of the
head of the Sign ruling in that part of time wherein you work. Eighthly, The
name of the earth, according to that part of time wherein you work. Ninthly,
and for the completing of the middle Circle, Write the name of the Sun and of
the Moon, according to the said rule of time; for as the time is changed, so
the names are to be altered. And in the outermost Circle, let there be drawn in
the four Angles, the names of the presidential Angels of the Air, that day
wherein you would do this work; to wit, the name of the King and his three
Ministers. Without the Circle, in four Angles, let Pentagones be made. In the
inner Circle let there be written four divine names with crosses interposed in
the middle of the Circle; to wit, toward the East let there be written Alpha,
and toward the West let there be written Omega; and let a cross divide the
middle of the Circle. When the Circle is thus finished, according to the rule
now before written, you shall proceed.

Of the names of the hours, and the Angels ruling them.
IT is also to be known, that the Angels do rule the hours in a successive
order, according to the course of the Heavens, and Planets unto which they are
subject; so that that Spirit which governs the day, rules also the first
hour of the day; the second from this governs the second hour; the third, the
third hour, and so consequently: and when seven Planets and hours have made
their revolution, it returns again to the first which rules the day.
Therefore we shall first speak of the names of the hours.

Hours of the day. Hours of the night. 1. Yain. 1. Beron. 2. Janor. 2. Barol.
3. Nasnia. 3. Thami. 4. Salla. 4. Athar. 5. Sadedali. 5. Methon. 6. Thamur. 6.

10. Aglo. 11. Abai. 11. Calerva. 12. Natalon. 12. Salam.

Of the names of the Angels and their Sigils, it shall be spoken in their
proper places. Now let us take a view of the names of the times. A year
therefore is fourfold, and is divided into the Spring, Summer, Harvest and
Winter; the names whereof are these, The Spring. Talvi. The Summer. Casmaran.
Autumn. Adarael. Winter. Farlas.

The Consecrations and Benedictions: and first of the Benediction of the Circle.
WHen the Circle is ritely perfected, sprinkle the same with holy or purging
water, and say, Thou shall purge me with hysop, O Lord, and I shall be clean:
thou shall wash me, and I shall he whiter then snow.

The Benediction of Perfumes.
THe God of Abraham, God of Isaac, God of Jacob, bless here the creatures of
these kinds, that they may fill up the power and virtue of their odours; so
that neither the enemy, nor any false imagination, may be able to enter into
them: through our Lord Jesus Christ, etc. Then let them be sprinkled with holy
water.

The Exorcisme of fire upon which the perfumes are to be put.
THe fire which is to be used for fumigations, is to be in a new vessel of
earth or iron; and let it be exorcised after this manner. I exorcise thee, O
thou creature of fire, by him by whom all things are made, that forthwith thou
cast away every phantasme from thee, that it shall not be able to do any hurt
in any thing. Then say, Bless, O Lord, this creature of fire, and sanctify it,
that it may be blessed to set forth the praise of thy holy name, that no hurt
may come to the Exorcisers or Spectators: through our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.

Of the Garment and Pentacle.
LEt it be a Priests Garment, if it can be: but if it cannot be had, let it be
of linen, and clean. Then take this Pentacle made in the day and hour of
Mercury, the Moon increasing, written in parchment made of a kids skin. But
first let there be said over it the Mass of the holy Ghost, and let it be
sprinkled with water of baptism.

pentacle

An Oration to be said, when the Vesture is put on.
ANcor, Amacor, Amides, Theodonias, Anitor, by the merits of the Angels, O
Lord, I will put on the Garment of Salvation, that this which I desire I may
bring to effect: through thee the most holy Adonay, whose kingdom endures for
ever and ever. Amen.

Of the manner of working.
LEt the Moon be increasing and equal, if it may then be done, and let her not
be combust.

The Operator ought to be clean and purified by the space of nine days before
the beginning of the work, and to be confessed, and receive the holy Communion.
Let him have ready the perfume appropriated to the day wherein he would perform
the work. He ought also to have holy water from a Priest, and a new earthen
vessel with fire, a Vesture and Pentacle; and let all these things be rightly
and duly consecrated and prepared. Let one of the servants carry the earthen
vessel full of fire, and the perfumes, and let another bear the book, another
the Garment and Pentacle, and let the master carry the Sword; over which there
must be said one Mass of the Holy Ghost; and on the middle of the Sword, let
there be written this name Alga, and on the other side thereof, the name On.
And as he goes to the consecrated place, let him continually read Letanies,
the servants answering. And when he comes to the place where he will erect the
Circle, let him draw the lines of the Circle, as we have before taught: and
after he has made it, Wash me O Lord, etc.
let him sprinkle the Circle with holy water, saying, Asperges me Domine, etc.

The Master therefore ought to be purified with fasting, chastity, and
abstinency from all luxury the space of three whole days before the day of the
operation. And on the day that he would do the work, being clothed with pure
garments, and furnished with Pentacles, Perfumes, and other things necessary
hereunto, let him enter the Circle, and call the Angels from the four parts of
the world, which do govern the seven Planets the seven days of the week,
Colors and Metals; whose name you shall see in their places. And with bended
knees invocating the said Angels particularly, let him say, O Angeli
supradicti, estote adjutores meae petitioni, and in adjutorium mihi, in meis
rebus and petitionibus.

Then let him call the Angels from the four parts of the world, that rule the
Air the same day wherein he does the work or experiment. And having implored
specially all the Names and Spirits written in the Circle, let him say, O vos
omnes, adjuro atque contestor per sedem Adonay, per Hagios, o Theos, Ischyros,
Athanatos, Paracletos, Alpha and Omega, and per haec tria nomina secreta, Agla,
On, Tetragrammaton, quod body debeatis adimplere quod cupio.

These things being performed, let him read the Conjuration assigned for the
day wherein he makes the experiment, as we have before spoken; but if they
shall be pertinacious and refractory, and will not yield themselves obedient,
neither to the Conjuration assigned to the day, nor to the prayers before made,
then use the Conjurations and Exorcisms following.

An Exorcism of the Spirits of the Air.

An Exorcism of the Spirits of the Air.
WE being made after the Image of God, endued with power from God, and made
after his Will, do exorcize you by the most mighty and powerful Name of God,
El, strong and wonderful (here he shall name the Spirits he would have appear,
of what Order soever they be) and we command you by him, who said the word and
it was done, and by all the names of God, and by the name Adonay, El, Elchim,
Elohe Zebaoth, Elion, Esc^rchie, Jah, Tetragrammaton, Saday, Lord God most
high: We exorcize you, and powerfully command you, that you forthwith appear
unto us, here before this Circle, in a fair humane shape, without any deformity
or tortuosity; come ye all such, because we command you by the name Y and V,
which Adam heard and spoke, and by the Name of God Agla, which Lot heard and
was saved with his Family; and by the name Joth, which Jacob heard from the
Angel wrestling with him, and was delivered from the hand of his Brother Esau;
and by the name Anephexeton, which Aaron heard and spoke, and was made wise;
and by the name Zebaoth, which Moses named, and all the Rivers and waters in
the land of Egypt were turned into blood; and by the name Ecerchie Oriston,
which Moses named, and all the Rivers brought forth frogs, and they ascended
into the houses of the Egyptians, destroying all things; and by the name Elion,
which Moses named, and there was great hail, such as has not been since the
beginning of the world; and by the name Adonay, which Moses named, and there
came up Locusts, which appeared upon the whole Land of Egypt, and devoured all
which the Hail had left; and by the name Schemes amathia, which Josua called
upon, and the Sun stayed his course; and by the name Alpha and Omega, which
Daniel named, and destroyed Bell and slew the Dragon; and in the name Emmanuel,
which the three children, Sidrach, Misach, and Abednego sung in the midst of
the fiery furnace, and were delivered; and by the name Hagios, and by the seal
of Adonay, and by o (...), Iscyros, Athanatos, Paracletus; and by these three
secret names, Agla, On, Tetragrammaton, I do adjure and contest you; and by
these names, and by all the other names of the living and true God, and by our
Lord Almighty, I exorcize and command you, by him that spoke the word and it
was done, to whom all creatures are obedient; and by the dreadful Judgment of
God; by the uncertain Sea of glass, which is before the face of the divine
Majesty mighty and powerful; by the four Beasts before the Throne, having eyes
before and behind, and by the fire round about his Throne, and by the holy
Angels of Heaven; by the mighty Wisdom of God, we do powerfully exorcize you,
that you appear here before this Circle to fulfill our will in all things which
shall seem good unto us; by the seal of Baldachia, and by this name
Primeumaton, which Moses named, and the earth opened and swallowed up Corah,
Dathan, and Abiram; and in the power of that name Primeumaton, commanding the
whole Host of Heaven, we curse you and deprive you from all your office, joy
and place, and do bind you in the depth of the bottomless Pit, there to remain
until the day of the last Judgment; and we bind you into eternal fire, and
into the lake of fire and brimstone, unless you forthwith appear here before
this Circle to do our will: Therefore come ye by these names, Adonay Zebaoth,
Adonay Amioram; come ye, come ye, Adonay commands you; Saday, the most mighty
and dreadful King of Kings, whose power no creature is able to resist, be unto
you most dreadful, unless ye obey, and forthwith affably appear before this
Circle, let miserable ruin and fire unquenchable remain with you: therefore
come ye in the name of Adonay Zebaoth, Adonay Amioram; come, come, why stay
you? hasten: Adonay, Saday, the King of Kings commands you; El, Aty, Titeip,
Azia, Hin, Jen, Minosel, Achadan, Vay, Vaah, Ey, Haa, Eye, Exe, a, El, El, El,
a, Hy, Hau, Hau, Hau, Va, Va, Va, Va.

A Prayer to God, to be said in the four parts of the world, in the Circle.
AMorule, Taneha, Latisten, Rabur, Teneha, Latisten, Escha, Aladia, Alpha and
Omega, Leyste, Oriston, Adonay: O my most merciful heavenly Father, have mercy
upon me, although a sinner; make appear the arm of thy power in me this day
(although thy unworthy child) against these obstinate and pernicious Spirits,
that I by thy will may be made a contemplator of thy divine works, and may be
illustrated with all wisdom, and always worship and glorify thy name. I
humbly implore and beseech thee, that these Spirits which I call by thy
judgment, may be bound and constrained to come, and give true and perfect
answers to those things which I shall ask them, and that they may declare and
show unto us those things which by me or us shall be commanded them, not
hurting any creature, neither injuring nor terrifying me or my fellows, nor
hurting any other creature, and affrighting no man; but let them be obedient to
my requests in all these things which I command them. Then let him stand in the
middle of the Circle, and hold his hand toward the Pentacle, and say, Per
Pentaculum Salomonis advocavi, dent mihi responsum verum. By the Pentacle of
Solomon I have called you, give me a true answer.

Then let him say, Beralanensis, Baldachiensis, Paumachiae and Apologiae sodes,
per Reges potestatesque magnanimas, ac principes praepotentes, genio,
Liachidae, ministri tartareae seeds: Primac, hic princeps sedis Apologiae nona
cohorte: Ego vos invoco, and invocando vos conjuro, atque superna Majestatis
munitus virtute, potenter imperio, per (...) qui dixit, and factum est, and cui
obediunt omnes creaturae: and per hoc nomen ineffabile, Tetragrammaton Jehovah,
in quo est plasmatum omne seculum, quo andito elementa corruunt, aer
concutitur, mare retrograditur, ignis extinguitur, terra tremit, omnesque
exercitus Coelestium, Terrestrium, and Infernorum tremunt, turbantur and
corruunt: quatenus cito and sine mord and omni occasume remota, ab universis
mundi partibus veniatis, and rationabiliter de omnibus quaecunque
interrogavero, respondeatis vos, and veniatis pacifice, visibiles, and
affabiles: nunc and sine mora manifestantes quod cupimus: conjurati per nomen
aeterni vivi and very Dei Helioren, and mandata nostra perficientes,
persistentes semper usquead finem, and intentionem meam, visibiles nobis, and
effabiles, clara voec nobis, intelligibile, and sine omni ambiguitate.

BEralanensis, Baldachiensis, Paumachiae and Apologiae seeds, by the most
mighty Kings and Potestates, and the most powerful Princes Genio, Liachidae,
Ministers of the Tartarean Seat, chief Prince of the Seat of Apologia in the
ninth Legion; I invoke you, and by invocating conjure you, and being armed with
power from the supreme Majesty, I strongly command you, by him who spoke and it
was done, and to whom all creatures are obedient; and by this ineffable name
Tetragrammaton Jehovah, which being heard the Elements are overthrown, the Air
is shaken, the Sea runs back, the Fire is quenched, the Earth trembles, and
all the Hosts of Celestials, Terrestrials and Infernals do tremble, and are
troubled and confounded together: Wherefore forthwith and without delay, do you
come from all parts of the world, and make rational answers unto all things I
shall ask of you; and come ye peaceably, visibly, and affably, now without
delay manifesting what we desire, being conjured by the Name of the eternal,
living and true God Helioren, and fulfill our commands, and persist unto the
end, and according to our intention, visibly and affably speaking unto us with
a clear voice, intelligible and without any ambiguity.

Visions and Apparitions.
QVibus vite peractis, apparebunt infinitae visiones, and phantasmata pulsantia
organa and omnis generis instrumenta musica, idque fit a spiritibus, ut terrore
compulsi socii abeant a Circulo, quia nihil adversus magistrum possunt. Post
haec videbis infinitos sagittarios cum infinita multitudine bestiarum
horribilem: quae ita se componunt, ac si vellent devorare socios: and tamen nil
timeant. Tunc Sacerdos sive Magister, adhibens manum pentaculo, dicat: Fugiat
hinc iniquitas vestra, virtute vexilli Dei. Et tunc Spiritus obedire magistro
coguntur, and socii nil amplius videbunt.

Then let the Exorcist say, stretching out his hand to the Pentacle, Ecce
Pentaculum Salomonis, quod ante vestram adduxi praesentiam: ecce personam
exorcizatoris in medio Exorcismi, qui est optime a Deo munitus, intrepidus,
providus, qui viribus potens vos exorcizando invocavit and vocat. Venite ergo
cum festinatione in virtute nominum istorum, Aye, Saraye, Aye, Saraye, Aye,
Saraye, ne differatis venire, per nomina aeterna Dei vivi and very Eloy,
Archima, Rabur: and peri hoc praesens Pentaculum, quod super vos potenter
imperat: and per vinturem coelestium Spirituum dominorum vestrorum: and per
personam exorcizatoris, conjurati, festinati venire and obedire praeceptori
vestro, qui vocatur Octinomos. His peractis, sibiles in quatuor angulis mundi.
Et videbis immediate magnos motus: and cum videris, dicas: Quid tardatis? quid
moramini? quid facitis? praeparate vos and obedite praeceptori vestro, in
nomine Domini Bathat, vel Vachat super Abrac ruens, superveniens, Abeor super
Aberer.

Tunc immediate venient in sua forma propria. Et quando videbis cos juxta
Circulum, ostende illis Pentaculum cooperatum syndone sacro, and
discooperiatur, and dicat, Ecce conclusionem vestram, nolite fieri
inobedientes. Et subito videbis eos in pacificae forma: and dicent tibi, Pete
quid vis, quia nos sumus parati complere omnia mandata tua, quia dominus ad
haec nos subjugavit. Cum autem apparuerint Spiritus, tunc dicas, Been veneritis
Spituus, vel reges nobilissimi, quia vos vocavi per illum cui omne genu
flectitur, coelestium, terrestrium and infernorum: cujus in manu omnia regna
regum sunt, nec est qui suae contrarius esse possit Majestati. Quatenus
constringuo vosi ut hic ante circulum visibiles, affabiles permanetis, tamdiu
tamque constantes, nec sint licentia mea recedatis, donec meam sine fallacia
aliqua and veredice perficiatis voluntatem, per potentiae illius virtutem, qui
mare posuit terminum suum, quem praeterire non potest, and lege illius
potentiae, non pertransit fines suos, Dei scilicet altissimi, regis, domini,
qui cuncta creavit, Amen. Then command what you will, and it shall be done.
Afterward license them thus: In nomine Patris, Filii, and Spiritus sancti, ite
in pace ad loca vestra: and pax sit inter nos and vos, parati sitis venire
vocati.

Visions and Apparitions.
THese things duly performed, there will appear infinite Visions and Phantasms,
beating of Organs and all kinds of musical Instruments, which is done by the
Spirits, that with the Terror they might force the Companions to go out of the
Circle, because they can do nothing against the Master. After this you shall
see an infinite Company of Archers, with a great multitude of horrible Beasts,
which will so compose themselves, as if they would devour the fellows:
nevertheless fear nothing.

Then the Priest or Master holding his hand toward the Pentacle, shall say,
Avoid hence these iniquities by virtue of the Banner of God; and then will the
Spirits be compelled to obey the Master, and the Company shall see no more.

Then let the Exorcist, stretching out his hand to the Pentacle, say, Behold
the Pentacle of Solomon which I have brought before your presence. Behold the
person of the Exorcist in the middle of the Exorcism, who is armed by God, and
without fear, and well provided, who potently invocateth and calls you by
exorcizing; come therefore with speed, in the virtue of these names, Aye,
Seraye, Aye, Seraye; defer not to come by the eternal Names of the living and
true God, Eloy, Archima, Rabur, and by the Pentacle here present, which
powerfully reigns over you, and by virtue of the Celestial Spirits your Lords,
and by the person of the Exorcist; being conjured, make haste to come and yield
obedience to your Master, who is called Octinomos. This being performed, there
will be hissings in the four parts of the world, and then immediately you shall
see great motions; and when you see them, say, Why stay you? wherefore do you
delay? what do you? prepare your selves and be obedient to your Master, in the
name of the Lord Rath(...) or Vachat rushing upon Abrac, Abeor coming upon
Aberer.

Then they will immediately come in their proper form; and when you see them
before the Circle, show them the Pentacle covered with fine linen; uncover it
and say, Behold your conclusion, if you refuse to be obedient; and suddenly
they will appear in a peaceable form, and will say, Ask what you will, for we
are prepared to fulfill all your commands, for the Lord has subjected us
hereunto: and when the Spirits have appeared, then you shall say, Welcome
Spirits, or most noble Kings, because I have called you through him to whom
every knee does bow, both of things in Heaven and things in Earth, and things
under the Earth, in whose hands are all the Kingdoms of Kings, neither is there
any that can contradict his Majesty. Wherefore I bind you, that you remain
affable and visible before this Circle, so long and so constant; neither shall
ye depart without my license, until you have truly and without any fallacy
performed my will, by virtue of his power who has set the Sea her bounds,
beyond which these cannot pass, nor go beyond the Law of his Power, to wit, of
the most high God, Lord and King, who has created all things, Amen. In the
Name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the holy Ghost, go in peace unto
your places; peace be between us and you, be ye ready to come when ye are
called.

These are the things which Peter de Abano has spoken concerning Magical
Elements.

But that you may the better know the manner of composing a Circle, I will set
down one Scheme; so that if any one would make a Circle in Spring time for the
first hour of the Lords day, it must be in the same manner as is the figure
following.

ISAGOGE: An Introductory Discourse of the nature of such Spirits as are
exercised in the sublunary Bounds; their Original, Names, Offices, Illusions,
Power, Prophesies, Miracles; and how they may be expelled and driven away.
By Geo. Pictorius Villinganus Dr. in Physic.
In a Discourse between CASTOR and POLLUX.
CASTOR. THe Greeks do report, that Castor and Pollux have both proceeded from
o^e egg; but this I scarcely credit, by reason of the difference of your
minds; for thou affectest the heavens, but she meditates upon the earth and
slaughters.


Pollux. And from thence perhaps was derived that argument, That liberty of
lying was always assigned to the Greeks.


Castor. Principally.


Pollux. But it is not to be supposed, that the Greeks are vain in all things;
but as many others, when they speak out of a three-footed thing; whereof also
the Poet Ovid speaks in verse, -- Nec fingunt omnia Graeci.


Castor. Homo homini Deus.
In this Proverb I protest they are most true, without any exception, that is,
(...), that is, One man to another is a Devil.


Pollux. Wherefore believe thou this to be most true, Castor?


Castor. Homo homini diabolus.
Truly, that man to man is a devil and a ravening wolf, daily events do most
certainly prove, if we do but note the treacheries that one man invents daily
against another, the robberies, thefts, plunderings, rapes, slaughters,
deceits, adulteries, and an hundred vipers of this nature; the fathers
persecute the son, with a serpentine and poisonous biting; one friend seeks to
devour another, neither can the guest be safe with his host.


Pollux. I confess it is truth thou speak; but for ought I hear, thou do
misunderstand the Etymology of the word compared in this Proverb; for Demon
here is not an horrible or odious name, but the name of one that does
administer help or succor unto another, Plin. lib. 2. chap. 7.
and whom Pliny calls a God.


Castor. Therefore do thou affirm the word Demon in this Proverb to signify
any other then a cunning and malicious accuser?


Pollux. Thou have not shot besides the mark: for, that there are more Demons
then that sublunary one which thou understandest, every one may easily
perceive, who has not negligently read the opinions of the most excellent
Plato.


Castor. I desire therefore, that thou would not conceal such his writings;
but that I may apprehend the marrow thereof.


Pollux. I will embrace such thy desire, for truly I do delight to treat with
thee concerning this subject; mark therefore, and give attention.

Plato divided the orders of Devils or Spirits into three degrees, Three
degrees of Spirits.
which as they are distinct in the greatness of their dignity, so also they are
different in the distance and holding of their places. The first degree of
Spirits.
And the first order he ascribes to those Spirits whose bodies are nourished
of the most pure element of Air, wrought and joined together, in a manner, as
it were with splendid threeds, not having so much reference to the element of
fire, that they may be perspicuous to the fight; neither do they so much
participate of the earth, that they may be touched or felt; and they do inhabit
the Celestial Theater, attending and waiting on their Prince, not to be
declared by any humane tongue, or beyond the commands of the most wise God.

But the other degree is derived from those Spirits which Apuleius terms
rational animals, passive in their mind, The second degree.
and eternal in their time, understanding the apostate Spirits spread abroad
from the bounds and borders of the Moon, unto us under the dominion of their
Prince Beelzebub, which before the fall of Lucifer had pure clarified bodies;
and now, like unto the former, do wander up and down, after their
transgression, in the form of an aerie quality.


Castor. These I do not conceive are understood in the Greek Proverb: for these
do hurt, and are the accusers and betrayers of men. But proceed.


Pollux. The third degree of Spirits is of a divine deity, The third degree.
which is called by Hermes, A divine miracle to man, if he do not degenerate
from the Kingly habit of his first form; whom therefore of this kind the
Greeks and Plato have called Demons, that is, God; and that man may be like
unto God, and profitable and commodious one to another; and so also (the Syrian
being witness) we have known Plato himself to have been called Demon, Plato
called demon, and Aristotle.
because he had set forth very many things of very high matters, for the good
of the Commonwealth; and so likewise Aristotle, because he very largely
disputed of sublunaries, and all such things as are subject to motion and
sense. Homer calls God and evil Spirits, Demons, without putting a
discrimination.


Castor. Thou have committed the ship to the waves, Pollux; therefore cease not
to proceed, and declare something more concerning the Office and employment of
these Spirits, to whom Plato attributes the second degree, and calls them
Lunaries.


Pollux. What shall I say?


Castor. In the first place, declare wherefore thou have before termed these
Spirits cunning and much knowing Accusers.


Pollux. Why the devil is said to have much know-
Saint Augustine unfoldeth this difficulty, and says, That a Devil does so far
signify the cunning and much knowing quickness and vivacity of his deceiful
wit, that by the congruent and agreeable seminal permixtures of elements, he
does so know the secrets and unknown virtues of men, as those things which may
be effected and wrought by themselves successively and leisurely according to
the course of nature, he by a speedy hasting or forcing of the works of nature,
or by his own art, sooner brings the same to pass. An example hereof he
gives in the wise men of Pharaoh, who immediately brought forth frogs and
serpents at the commandment of the King, which nature more slowly and leisurely
procreateth.


Castor. Thou have excellently answered to the question, Pollux; but add
something concerning the original of those Spirits which do resist and refuse
virtue; for oftentimes doubting, I have been persuaded that such Erynnes as are
from God, do not appear out of the earth.


Pollux. The Ecclesiastical Scripture everywhere makes mention of the rising
of them; but I will unfold such a doubt: and there do arise many and various
opinions of Writers, but more commonly Peter Lombardus in his book of
Sentences, Lib. 2. distinct. 7.
draws his Allegations out of St. Augustine upon Genesis; to wit, That the
Devil was before his fall an Archangel, and had a fine tender body, composed by
God, out of the serenity and purest matter of the sky and air; but then after
his fall from an Archangel, he was made an Apostate, and his body no more fine
and subtle; but his body was made that it might suffer the effect of a more
gross substance, from the quality of the more obscure, dark, and spissious Air,
which body also was stricken and astonished with the raging madness of pride,
did draw away very many which were then Angels with him into his service and
bondage, that they might be made Devils, who for him in this troublesome world
do exercise their servile courses for him, and they do compel the inhabitants
therein, or rather entice them; and to this purpose they undertake various
endeavors, and do attempt various and manifold horrible studies, that are
abominable unto God, and they serve in slavery and thraldom to Beelzebub their
Prince, and are held in most strong captivity.


Castor. What? Have we the fall of this Archangel no where else in holy Writ,
but in the writings of St. Augustine? The fall of Lucifer in Scripture.



Pollux. We have also the fall of other Angels.


Castor. Where?


Pollux. In Esaias, to whom thou shall give the honor of an Evangelist, rather
then a Prophet, because he so fully and plainly foretold of Christ and his
kingdom: he makes mention hereof in his 14 Chapter. And we have them also
spoken of by the Apostle Peter, when he says, God spared not his Angels which
sinned. 2 Epist. 2.


Castor. Have the Devils a select place appointed them by God, which they
inhabit?


Pollux. Peter the head of the Church, What place the devils have appointed.
in the place before quoted, affirms them to be cast headlong into hell,
reserved in the chains of hell, from whence (as Cortesius says) they never go
out, unless it be to tempt, provoke and delude men. But St. Augustine the
Champion of Christ, in his book of The Agony of a Christian, teaches, That
these kind of Spirits do inhabit in the sublunary region. And in his 49 Epist.
he sets forth, That the most dark and obscure part of the Air, is predestined
unto them as a prison, that they may the more nearly cast their nets of
enticing and detaining.


Castor. Origin has taught, The torments of the devils are everlasting.
That the punishments of the Devils are appointed for a time; what say thou
to this?


Pollux. What shall I say? unless I should bewail and deplore the opinion of so
great a man.


Castor. Wherefore should thou do so?


Poll. Truly if they have hardened themselves in wickedness, time cannot purge
nor cleanse them; or if they never so much desire it, they can never be able to
accomplish it; for there is no space of repentance, nor time to recall that
which is past, given unto them.


Castor. Thou have now declared that the Archangel that became an apostate, did
draw away very many other Angels with him in his fall, that they might become
Devils: could not he of his own proper inseparate malice after his fall
sufficiently rule over his own Province, without the Angels that fell with him?


Poll. Why the Devil has familiars.
He could: but being allured by that pride, which made him so arrogantly affect
the Majesty of God, he did so far strive to be like unto God, that he chose
very many Ministers unto himself, to which in general he does not commit all
things he would have effected, but diverse things to diverse Ministers, as may be
gathered from the Hebrew Astronomers. Those which we call Jovii, and
Antemeridianii, which are false Gods, Demons Jovii or Antemerid.
that is, liars, which desire to be esteemed and adored for Gods, and they are
appointed as Servants and slaves to the Devil their Prince, that they might
allure the people of the earth into a common love of themselves, which Plato
says, Is the fountain of all wickedness, that they may aspire to authority and
greatness, covet to be gorgeously clothed, to be called Monarchs of the earth
in perpetual power, and Gods upon earth. It is said, Mat. 4.
That it was one of these that spoke to our Savior, showing him all the
Kingdoms of the earth, saying, All these things will I give thee, if thou will
fall down and worship me.


Castor. The Southern Spirits. Libicus, Sapho and Dioclesian, Gods.
Certainly these Meridiani, I have almost declared to appear a madness in
Libicus Sapho and Dioclesian the Emperor, who accounted, the utmost degree of
blessedness was, to be reputed for Gods.


Pollux. Truly, this is a certain natural foolishness of the mind, and of
humane nature: he began, having taken certain little birds, to teach them by
little and little to pronounce humane words, and say, (...), that is, Sapho is
a great God. The Comment of Sapho.
Which birds when they could pronounce the words perfectly, he sent them abroad
for this end and purpose, that flying everywhere abroad, they might repeat
those words; and the people which were ignorant of his deceitful invention,
were drawn to believe, that those words were spoken by divine instinct, and
thereupon adore and worship him for a God. The other would compel his Subjects
hereunto, that prostrating themselves down, and lifting up their hands, they
should worship him as Almighty.


Castor. But are not they the captives of the Devil, Psalm 55.
who stir up wars, which are called bloody-men in Scripture?


Poll. The Martialists of the North part of the world, are called Executioners
of vengeance, Authors of devastations, The Spirits of the North.
and sowers of evil, working and executing judgment with Asmodeus, for their
King Abaddon or Apollyon, whom St. John in his Revelation, mentions to be
banished and expelled; for these Spirits have committed to them rapines,
hatred, envy, robberies, wrath, anger, the excitements and provocations to sin,
Meridian Spirits.
war and fury; sometimes making the Meridional Spirits their Messengers. And
Arioch the Spirit of vengeance, whose work is to cause discord among brethren,
to break wedlock, and dissolve conjugal love, that it is impossible to be
renewed; of these mention is made in the 39 Chapter of Ecclesiasticus. Ecclus
39.28.
And Esaias the heavenly Prophet speaks of other Spirits sent from God to the
Egyptians to make them err, which were Spirits of darkness, that is, of lies;
Spirits of darkness.
and this kind of Spirit they call Bolichim.


Castor. Is unlawful venery, and excessive gluttony, also to be imputed to the
Devils?


Poll. Yes chiefly; for Iamblicus does assert, Occidental Spirits.
That the Spirits of the water, of the western part of the world, and some
meridional Spirits, are predestined to this purpose; such as Nisrach and
Kellen, that do so frame and contrive unlawful loves, which produce shame and
dishonesty, revellings and gurmandizings, surfetings, with excessive
drunkenness, wanton dances, gluttony and vomiting: they wander about lakes,
fish ponds and rivers, and which are the worst, foul and most fraudulent kind
of Spirits: and by Alcinach an occidental Spirit; he causes shipwracks,
tempests, earthquakes, hail, rain, and frequently subverteth and overturneth
ships: and if he will appear visible, he appears and is seen in the shape of
a woman. The Hebrew Astronomers before spoken of, The spirits of the air do
infect the air.
do say, That the Spirits of the Air do cause thunders, lightnings and
thunderbolts, that so they might corrupt and infect the Air, and produce
pestilence and destruction. Of such kind of Spirits St. John makes mention in
the 9 Chapter of the Revelation, having M(...)is for their tutelar, which is a
Spirit causing heat in the time of noon. ^t. Paul calls him, The Prince of
the power of the Air, and the Spirit that rules in the children of
disobedience.


Castor. E^h. s.(...).
Are there so many monsters in Phlegeton, Pollux?


Poll. And many more; for the same Hebrew Assertors do declare and maintain,
Spirits of fire.
That there are S^^^^^s of the fiery element, raging about like the fierce
Panthers, which are conversant under the lunary regions, that whatsoever is
committed to them, they forthwith execute the same. And there are Spirits of
the earth, which inhabit in groves, Spirits of the earth
woods and wildernesses, and are the plague and mischief of hunters; and
sometimes they frequent open fields, endeavoring to seduce travelers and
passengers out of their right way, or to deceive them with false and wicked
illusions; or else they seek to afflict men with a hurtful melancholy, to make
them furious or mad, that they may hurt them, and sometimes almost kill them.
The chief of these are Sanyaab and Achimael, which are oriental Spirits, a
kind unapt for wickedness, by reason of the constancy of their dispositions.
Subterranean Spirits.
There are also subterranean Spirits, which do inhabit in dens and caverns of
the earth, and in remote concavities of mountains, that they might invade deep
pits, and the bowels of the earth; these do dig up metals, and keep treasures,
which oftentimes they do transport from one place to another, left any man
should make use thereof: they stir up winds with flashing flames of fire: they
smite the foundations of buildings, acting frightful daunces in the night, from
which they suddenly vanish away, with making a noise and sounds of bells,
thereby causing fear in the beholders; and sometimes dissembling, and faining
themselves to be the Souls of the dead: notwithstanding they are ignorant in
compassing their deceits upon women; of which company the Negromancers do say,
is Gazael, Fegor and Anarazol, Meridian Spirits.


Castor. How warily ought a man to walk, Pollux, amongst so many ginnes and
snares?


Poll. A man never walks safely, A man never walks safe. Ephesians. 6.
unless he fortify and strengthen himself with the armor of God, which is,
That his loins be girt about with truth, and having on the breast plate of
righteousness, let him walk with his feet shod with the preparation of the
Gospel of peace, and let him take the shield of says, and the helmet of
salvation, whereby he shall dash in pieces all the darts of his adversary. But
hear further: There are also besides these, other lying Spirits (although they
are all liars) yet these are more apt to lie; they are called Pythons, from
whence Apollo is called Pythius. They have a Prince, of whom mention is made in
the book of the Kings, where it is said, 1 Kings 11.
I will be a lying Spirit in the month of all thy Prophets; from whom the
Spirits of iniquity do but a little differ, which also are called vessels of
wrath. Belial, whom they have interpreted to be without any equal, and Paul
calls him an Apostate or transgressor, is filthily infervient for the worst
inventions. Plato affirms Theut to have been such a one, who was the first
that found out and invented Plays and Dice: to whom we will join the Monk, who
invented the use of Gunpowder, in his Engines of war. Of these Jacob makes
mention in Genesis, Pu(...) G^n. 4^.
where he blesses his Sons: he says, Simeon and Levi are bloody vessels of
iniquity; Oh my soul, come not thou into their counsels. The Psalmist terms
these Spirits, vessels of death; Isa. 7.
Esaias calls them, vessels of fury; Jeremiah, vessels of wrath; and Ezekiel
calls them, vessels of death and destruction. The Negromancers do call the
said Belial, Ch^dar, an oriental Spirit, which has under him also the Spirits
of Juglers, who do imitate and endeavor to act miracles, that they may seduce
false Magicians and wicked persons. It is apparently manifest, that the Serpent
which deceived Eve, was such a seducer, and Sat^^ is his Prince, of whom it is
spoken in the Revelation, that he should deceive the whole world. And such a
one was he, that at Tubinga, in the sight of many people devoured a whole
Chariot and some horses.


Castor. And what shall be the end of these false Prophets, and workers of
wickedness? I can scarce believe that there is any angle or corner in the whole
fabric of the world, that is free from them.


Pol. Scarce the smallest mite that may be seen.


Castor. The world is the receptacle of
Therefore do thou truly call the world the receptacle of those false lights.


Poll. If it were not most safely purged with the Sword of the word of God, it
would forthwith be worse.


Castor. Without doubt.


Poll. Nevertheless I have seen many that remain, whom I have not yet inscribed
in this frantique Catalogue.


Castor. Who are they?


Poll. devils, false accusers, and spies.
False accusers and spies, obedient to Astaroth, who is called a Devil among the
Greeks; and John calls him the accuser of the brethren. Also there are
tempters and deceivers that lie in wait to deceive, who are present with every
man; and these we term evil Angels, which have Mammon for their King, and they
do affect men with an insatiable avarice and thirsty desire after authority and
dominion. There are others called Lucifugi, Lucifugi, fliers from the light.
which fly from the light, never appearing in the day, but delighting in
darkness, maliciously vexing and troubling men, and sometimes by Gods
permission, either by some touching, breathing or inspiration, do hurt to them:
but truly they are a kind which are unapt for to do much wickedness, because
they eschew and fly from any communication with men Pliny the second relates,
that there was such a one at Athens, A horrible apparition of a Spirit in the
house of Anthenodorus.
in a certain spacious house, which Anthenodorus the Philosopher happened to
purchase. And Suetonius in his sixth book of Caesar, makes mention of another
to have long continued in the garden of Lamianus.


Castor. I desire, if it be not too irksom to thee, declare unto me what Pliny
speaks concerning this Spirit of Anthenodorus.


Poll. The story is something long and prolixious, yet it shall not much
trouble me to relate it. It is thus: Pliny in the seventh book of his Epistles
writes, Of a certain large spacious house at Athens, which no body would
inhabit by reason of the nocturnal incursions of Spirits, which were so
formidable to the inhabitants, that sometimes in the daytime, and when they
were watching, they would cast them into dreams, so always, that the shapes
and forms which they then saw, were ever present in their memory. Where at
length a certain Philosopher named Anthenodorus happened to purchase that
house, and prepared and furnished the same for himself to dwell in; and because
all men had an evil suspicion of that house, he forthwith commanded his
servants to provide him a bed and tables, that after he had completed and
finished his study he might go to bed. He therefore (says Pliny) when he went
in (in the evening) and applied himself to his study, suddenly beard the locks
to shake open, and the chains to be moved; nevertheless he did not lift up his
eyes, nor stirred from his book, but stopped his ears with his fingers, lest
that furious tumult might work a vain fear upon him; but the noise still
approaching nearer unto him, at length he looked up, and saw an effigies like
unto a finger beckoning and calling unto him; which he little regarded, until
it had touched him three times, and the noise drew near unto the table; and
then he looked up, and took a light, and beheld the Spirit, as it were an old
man, worn away with withered leanness and deformity, his beard hanging down
long, horrible and deformed hair, his legs and feet were as it were laden with
chains and fetters: he went toward a gate which was bolted, and there left the
Philosopher, and vanished away.


Castor. What fearful things thou relatest, Pollux! but what was the event of
this sad spectacle?


Poll. The next day he related the whole matter to the Magistrates in order, as
he had seen the same, admonishing them that they should dig diligently about
the threshold of the door; for there it was probable they might find
something, which might cause the house to be quiet and habitable.


Castor. What did they find?


Poll. Having dug up the earth, Pliny says, They found a dead carcass,
bound and entangled in chains and fetters, his flesh being consumed with
devouring time, which without delay they caused to be buried, according to the
Christian ceremonies.


Castor. But this being performed, did the house afterward become quiet and
habitable?


Poll. Yes, very well.


Castor. They are possessed with madness, that destroy Churchyards. The Spirit
Zazelus and Eurynomus.
What madness therefore possesses them who profane and destroy Churchyards,
where the sacred Organs of the holy and blessed Spirit do rest; and do give the
bones of the dead for meat to the Spirit Zazelus, of whom mention is made in
the 3 of the Kings; and we read in Pausanias, amongst the Histories of Delphos,
that he was called Eurynomus.


Poll. Thou shall find, that the Governors of Cities that were of the opinion
and judgment of Christians, did subvert, destroy and profane these holy
places, that herein the youth might dance their mocking interludes, after the
furious sound of the drum or taber, and sing, Iopaean; or, there the poor
inferior old women did sell base trumpery or Lupines, which God would have to
be purged with holy prayers, for the salvation of souls, or breaking of bread
to the hungry.


Castor. But it is an impious and heathenish thing so to have touched the
anointed of God.


Poll. And worse then heathenish; for the heathens did highly esteem the Rites
and Ceremonies of burials, The Ceremony of burials was in great esteem amongst
the Heathens.
as Elpinor is witness in Homer, where he yields up his life; and in Homer he
speaks to Ulysses, I entreat thee, O Ulysses, to be mindful of me, and not
depart away hence and leave me uninterred, lest that, not being ritely buried,
I shall be made the wrath of the Gods. And Archita the Philosopher in Flaecus,
thus speaks to the Mariner.

Horaee 1 book of verses.
Me quoque divexi Rapidus comes rionis

At tu Nauta vagae ne parce malignus arenae,
Ossibus and capiti inhumato.
Particulam dare; si quodcunque minabitur Eurus
Fluctibus Hesperiis, Venusinae
Plectantur silvae, te sospite multaque merces
Vnde potest tibi defluat aequo.
Ab Jove, Neptuno, sacri Custode Tarenti.

Orion's rapid Comrade Notus, me
O'rewhelmed in the Illyrian Sea;
Oh Seaman frowning, not forbear to spread
Upon my bones, and inhum'd head,
A little fleeting sand! what the East does threat,
Hesperian waves may only beat
Vainly Venusimu's woods, whilst safe and rich,
Thou climbst to Fortunes highest pitch.
Jove kind, and Neptune too, Tarentum's power
Thou slights; what on the guiltless score,
Of thy ensuing sons may fall: like Vrne,
Like funeral, and proud return,
May wait thee too; my curses shall have force
Whence no Atonements get remorse.
And Palinurus to Aeneas in his sixth book of Virgils Aeneids.

Nunc me fluctus habent versantque in littore venti, Virgil. Aeneid. 6.

Quod te per Coeli jucundum lumen and auras
Per genitorem ora, per spem surgentis Juli.
Eripe me his invicte malis, aut tu mihi terram
Injice namque potes.
I Am now in the waves, winds toss me against the shore,
By Heavens rejoicing light I thee implore;
And by the Air, by old Anchyses too,
And by the hopes of young Julius, thou
Unconquered Hero, help me but away,
From these sad troubles, or my body lay
In The earth; for thou can do it.

Castor. The vain Religion of the Gentiles.
Have the Gentiles so greatly esteemed the ceremony of burials?


Pollux. Yes, very much; for their Religion did hold that the Soul of a body
which was uninterred, was void of any intelligible essence, and left to the
power and command of a raging furious fancy, and subject to the torment and
affliction of corporal qualities; so that it being an aerie body, sometimes the
departed shadow would speak unto his remaining friends, and sometimes evilly
vex and torment his enemies with revenge, as in the Poet, Dido threatens
Aeneas, saying, Aeneid. 4.
Omnibus umbra locis adero dabis improbe penas.
My ghost shall every where attend thee, Villain
I will torment thee. --


The History of C. Caligula.
Suetonius, as we have shown before, adds the like concerning the dead body
of C. Caligula the Emperor in the Garden of Lamius, being not duly buried; for
this body, because it was only covered with a light turff, did very much
disquiet and trouble the possessors of the Garden, with violent incursions in
the night; until by his sisters, who were returned from banishment, it was
taken up again and ritely and duly by them buried.


Castor. The house of Caligula burnt, because of the Spirits. The mountain of
Hechelberg.
And the house wherein the same Emperor died, could by no other way or means be
freed from the fury of these shadows or spirits, as History makes mention, but
by burning thereof.


Pollux. Aristotle speaking of miracles, mentions a certain mountain in
Norway, named Hechelberg, environed about with the Sea, that continually sent
forth such lamentable voices, like the yelling and howling of infernal devils,
insomuch that the noise and clamor of their terrible roaring might be heard
almost a mile; and the flocking together of great Ravens and Vultures near it,
did prohibit any access thereunto. A Hill in Lyppora.
And he reports that in Lyppora near about the Aeolian Islands, there was a
certain Hill from whence in the night there was heard Cymbals, and sounds of
tinkling instruments of brass, with certain secret and hidden screechings,
laughings and roarings of Spirits. But even now, Castor, thou did make
mention of Zazelus, whom also thou did assert to have been called Earynomus
by Pausania; I desire thee to show me something more largely concerning this
Spirit.


Castor. They do declare that he lives altogether by the flesh of the dead;
Zazelus lives by the flesh of the dead.
so as sometimes he does not leave the bones.


Pollux. Saxo Grammaticus, in the fifth book of his Danish History, does most
truly subscribe their consents and agreements to this thy Assertion; for there
he sets before our eyes an admirable History of one Asuitus and Asmundus, which
easily proves all thy sayings.


Castor. I beseech thee declare this unto me, Pollux.


Pollux. Give attention; it is thus: A wonderful History of Asuitus and
Asmundus.
Asuitus and Asmundus had sworn with mutual vows each to other, that he which
should live longest of them, would entomb himself alive. Now sickness did
consume away Asuitus before Asmundus; whereupon Asmundus for his Oath of
friendship sake, with his dog and his horse entombed himself alive in a vast
deep den; having carried with him some meat, whereupon a long time he fed. And
at length Ericus the King of Suecia came into that place with an Army, and
broke open the tomb of Asuitus; (supposing there had been treasure hid therein)
but when the cave was opened, he drew out Asmundus, and brought him into the
light, who was covered with a deformed sharp countenance, a deadly deformity,
and gored with blood flowing from his fresh wounds.


Castor. But this story pertains not to our purpose.


Pollux. Truly it does, if you diligently mark these verses, which set forth
the cause of his wounds.


Castor. Show me those verses, if thou have them.


Pollux. They are these which follow.

Asmundus reports of himself, that a Spirit eat up his horse and his dog, and
afterward began to devour him, and that he beat and wounded the Spirit.
Quid stupetis qui relictum me Color cernitis?
Obsolescit nempe vivus omnis inter mortuos,
Nescio quo Stygii numinis ausu,
Missus ab inferis Spiritus affluit
Saevis alipedem dentibus edit,
Infandoque Canem praebuit ori,
Non contentus equi vel canis esu,
Mox in me rapidos transtulit ungues,
Discissaque gena sustulit aurem;
Hinc laceri vultus horret imago,
Emicat inque fero vulnere sanguis
Haud impune tamen monstrifer egit,
Nam ferro secui mox caput ejus,
Perfodique nocens stipite Corpus.
Why are ye amazed to see me pale!
Amongst th'dead what is living needs must fail:
By what strange warrant from black Hell,
A Spirit sent, I know not, fell
With merciless teeth upon my Horse,
And next my Dog without remorse,
Devoured: but not with Dog and Horse
Contented, he on me the force
Of his sharp nails tried, hence did tear,
Part of this cheek, and one whole ear;
So my torn face does look thus ill,
And all this blood appears still.
But yet this monstrous fiend from me,
I do assure you escaped not free;
His head my sword did from him take,
And's trunk to the ground I fixed with stake.

Castor. I observe here, that Asmundus did cut the head of the Spirit Zazelus
or Eurynomus, and struck and pierced his body with a club; what? have Spirits
bodies, that may be seen and handled by men?


Pollux. Cortesius does not deny, but that their natures may receive the habit
and covering of vegetable bodies, The devils have bodies.
and be transformed in several kinds of shapes, whereby they can the more
craftily and subtly delude and deceive the improvident wits of men. Basilius
Magnus also testifies the same, and witnesses, that they have bodies
appropriate to themselves, as likewise also have the pure Angels. Psellus a
Necromancer does also report the same; and he also teaches, That sometimes
they sleep or rest, and do change their places, and show themselves visible to
the senses of men. Socrates asserteth, That a Spirit did speak with him, The
Spirits cannot be discerned by sex.
which also sometimes he saw and felt; but their bodies cannot be discerned to
be different in sex. But Marcus Cherronesus, an excellent searcher into the
natures of Spirits, writes, That they have simple bodies, and that there does
belong a difference of sex to compound bodies; yet their bodies are easily
drawn to motion and flexibility, and naturally apt to receive every
configuration. For, says he, even as the clouds do show forth the apparition
and resemblance sometimes of men, and sometimes of every thing you conceive; so
likewise do the bodies of Spirits receive various shapes as they please; by
reason whereof they transform themselves into the forms sometimes of men, All
Spirits cannot receive several shapes.
and sometimes of women. Nevertheless this is not free to them all, but only to
the fiery and aerie Spirits. For he teaches, That the Spirits of the water
have more slow and less active bodies, which by reason of the slowness and
softness of that element, they do most especially resemble birds and women; of
which kind the Naiades and Nereides are, celebrated by the Poets. Trimetius
testifies, That the Devils do desire to assume the shapes of men rather then
any other form; but when they cannot find the matter of the air convenient and
befitting for that purpose. And he says, That they frame such kind of
apparences to themselves, as the contrary humor or vapor will afford; and so
they are seen sometimes in the form and shape of a Lion, a Wolf, a Sow, an
Ass, a Centaure, of a Man horned, having feet like a Goat: such as it is
reported were seen in the mountain of Thrungia, where there was heard a
terrible roaring.


Castor. Porphyrius in Eusebius, in his fourth book of Evangelical
Preparations, teaches, That some of these are good Spirits, and some bad; but
I have counted them to be all evil, Pollux.


Pollux. Then it seems that thou art not seduced with the assertions either
of Porphyrius, or Apuleus, or Proclus, or of some other Plantonicks, which are
mentioned in St. Augustines book of The City of God, 1, 2, and 3 Chapters, who
also do affirm that there are some of these Spirits good; for Eusebius in the
said book and 6 Chapter; and St. Augustine concerning the same in his book of
The City of God, the 9 Chapter and the 8, There is no Demon good.
with very great and strong Arguments do convince the Platonicks, that none of
these Demons are good, but all evil; and that we do also approve of from their
names, which are everywhere set forth in holy Scripture; for the Devil is
called Diabolus, Why he is called Diabolus.
that is, flowing downwards: that he which swelling with pride, determined to
reign in high places, fell flowing downwards to the lowest parts, like the
torrent of a violent stream, as Cassiodorus writes. And he is called Satan,
Satan.
that is, an adversary; who as St. Jerome testifies, by reason of the
corruption of his own malice, he continually resists, and is an adversary
against God, who is the chiefest good. Behemoth.
He is called Behemoth in the 40 Chapter of Job, which signifies an Ox; for
even as an Ox desires bay, so he with the teeth of his suggestions, coveteth
to destroy the upright lives of spiritual men. Leviathan.
And Leviathan in the same place, which signifies an addition, because the
Devil always endeavors to add evil to evil, and punishment to punishment.
Apollyon.
He is also called in Revelation 15 Apollyon, signifying a rooter out; for he
rooteth out the virtues which God planteth in the Soul. A Serpent.
He is called a Serpent in the 12 of the Revelation, by reason of his
virulency. A Lion in the 1 Epist. Peter and the last Chapter, which roareth
about seeking whom he may devour. He is called a cunning Workman Isa. 55.
because by his malice the vessels that are elected and approved. He is called,
Isa. 34. Onocentaurus, Erynus, Pilosus, Siren, Lamia, Vlula, Struthio. And by
David in the 90 Psalm. an Aspe, Basiliske and Dragon. In the Gospel Mammon, the
Prince of this world, and Ruler of darkness.


Castor. Why therefore have the Divines declared, That the Almighty has given
two kinds of Spirits unto men; the one good, the keeper and preserver of their
lives, the other evil, resisting the good: if they are all evil?


Pollux. The holy Doctors do understand by the good Spirit a good Angel, such
as we read Raphael was to Tobias, who bound the evil Spirit Asmodeus in the
wilderness of the furthest parts of Egypt, that he might be the more safe.


Castor. It had been more safe for every man to have been without the evil
Spirits; what therefore was the will of the heavenly Father concerning them?


Pollux. That by the assistance of the good Spirits, we might courageously wage
continual war against the evil Spirits; but being clothed with the harness of
righteousness, like valiant soldiers we may gird our loins with truth, and
with the shield of faith resist and fight against all his darts.


Castor. If we condescend unto this warfare of Spirits, it seems good to
inquire whether the Devils have power of doing hurt, granted unto them by God;
or whether of themselves they can hurt as much as they please?


Pollux. If the last were true, who could compare the end of their hurting? but
it is very manifest, The devils are the Princes of the earth.
that their authority from on high is of so great existency, that John the
Evangelist doubts not to name the Devils the Princes of the earth.


Castor. In what manner therefore do they hurt?


Pollux. Although they be most mighty and powerful Spirits, yet they can do no
hurt unless it be by permission; or, as Damascenus says, By dispensation. And
Chrysostom says, They have a limited power; for truly without the will of God,
they cannot touch a hair of any man's head. The Devil could not have deceived
the Prophets of Abab, if he had not received power from God; neither could he
have brought any detriment upon Job, either unto his body or his goods, but by
the power God had given him. In the 7 of Exodus the Magicians made Frogs and
Serpents by the power of the Devil permissively; but Lice they could not bring
forth, by reason of the greater power of God prohibiting them. Neither in the
Gospel could the Devils hurt the Swine until Christ had given them leave.


Castor. Therefore the Devil is not so much to be feared, but the Lord our God,
that either he would not suffer him to rage against us; or if at any time by
his own determinate counsel he let loose his chairs, that then he would defend
and mercifully preserve us.


Pollux. Thou say well; for even as a wild Boar is not to be feared if he
be bound, and held with a strong chain by a powerful strong man, and who is
able by his strength to restrain the fierceness of the Boar; but the man is to
be feared, and requested, that he would not let loose the Boar: So also Satan
is not to be feared, being bound with the cords of the Almighty; but the
Almighty rather, who holds him with a cord, lest at any time he should let
loose his cord, for to execute his will against us.


Castor. The devils seducement where the word is not known.
We know that the Devils, after the incarnation of the Word, were called the
Lords of the earth; but I wonder, where the Word is not yet incarnate, whether
they have power also over men.


Pollux. If it pleases God, they have very much; but take a demonstration
thereof, Castor, from the Caldeans, amongst whom the Devil raged with so much
power and dominion, that they made no esteem of the true God, but worshipped
the elements. There needs not a demonstration of the Greeks; for the fury of
the Devil did so much reign amongst them, that by his Arguments, they accounted
Saturn for a very great God, devouring their own proper Children; and Jupiter,
an adulterer and father of all filthiness, they named to be the father of Gods
and men; Bacchus, the most wicked example of all servitude and bondage, they
called a free father; Venus a strumpet, they termed a pure virgin; and they
worshipped Flora an harlot, as a type or example of virginity. There is no man
that is ignorant, that the Egyptians have been worse then the Greeks, when they
made peculiar Gods to themselves, by the inanimate persuasions of the Devil:
for one worshipped a sheep, another a goat, another a calfe; very many did
worship hoggs, crows, hawks, vultures, eagles, crocodiles, cats, dogs, wolves,
asses, dragons; and things growing also, as onyons, garlic, and thorns; as
every one that is covetous of reading, shall find in Damascenus, in his
History of Josaphat and Barlaas, and in Eusebius, in the fourth book and first
Chapter of Evangelical Preparations; neither do I account the Hebrews (who
glory in being the offspring of their father Abraham) to have been better then
the former, when also by the instinct of the devil, after their coming up out
of Egypt, with cruel hands they violently assaulted the Prophets and holy men
of God, whom at length they also slew: that I may hold my peace, how diligently
they have brought into their Religion the Gods, or rather Devils of the
Gentiles.


Castor. I perceive by these thy assertions, that one Devil, and another Devil,
has been adored for Gods; for thou have now said, That the Greeks, by the
madness wherewith the devil possessed them, have made unto themselves, Saturn,
Jupiter, Bacchus, Venus, and Flora, for Gods; which Lactantius in his fourth
book De vera Sapientia, also accounts for Devils.


Pollux. Declare, I pray thee, the words of Lactantius.


Castor. Mark them; they are thus: The same Devils are the gods of the
Gentiles; but if any one will not believe these things of me, then let him
credit Homer, who joyneth the great Jupiter to the great Devils; and the other
Poets and Philosophers do call them sometimes Gods, and sometimes Devils,
whereof there is one true, and another false: for the most wicked Spirits when
they are conjured, do confess themselves to be Devils; but where they are
worshipped, they declare themselves to be Gods, that they may thrust men into
errors, and draw them from the worship of the true God; through whom alone
eternal death can be escaped.


Pollux. It is expedient for me now to be more inquisitive in this discourse,
whether there be power given to the Devils to foretell things to come?
concerning which thing hitherto I have not been able to dart at the right mark;
for this question seems sufficiently doubtful unto me.


Castor. St. Augustine in his book De Natura Daemonum, dissolveth this
Gordoneus knot, and says, That the damned Spirits, The devils do foretell
things to come.
being filled full of all manner of impiety and wickedness, do sometimes
challenge to themselves power of foreseeing things to come because in the sense
of their Aerie bodies, they have a fan more strong and prevalent power of
fore-knowing, then men of earthly bodies can have; or because of the
incomparable swiftness of their aerie bodies, which wonderfully exceeds not
only the celerity of men and wild beasts, but also the flying of birds: by
which means, they are able to declare things long before they come to be known;
which we, by reason of the earthly slowness of our sense, cease not to wonder
at and admire: or because of the benefit of their continual life, they obtain
this wonderful experience of things; which we cannot attain to, because of the
shortness of our momentaneous life, which is but as it were a bubble.


Poll. This last assertion of S. Augustine seems unto me to be more true then
the rest, because the Series of many years does cause great experience.


Cast. If any one shall deny these opinions of Augustine, as erroneous,
Damascenus sets a greater witness of these things, without all exception,
before our eyes; who in his second book of Orthodox Faith says thus: That the
devils cannot foreknow things to come, The devils of themselves can not
foreknow things to come.
for that belongs only unto God: but so much as they are able to know, they
have from the disposition of the celestial and inferior bodies.


Poll. Why therefore do the devils so willingly and of their own accord
undertake Prophecies, and to answer Oracles? What benefit have they from hence?


Cast. Why the devils desire to be counted Prophets.
Nothing, but that hereby they seek to get great estimation, and covet to be
counted worthy of admiration, and to be adored in stead of Gods.


Poll. We know that the devil is the father of lies, Castor: from whence we are
piously to believe, that those things which he foretells, he extracteth from
his own lies.


Cast. Furthermore, the Prophet Esaias says thus: Show the things that are to
come hereafter, Isa. 41:
and tell us, that we may know that ye are gods. And the Apostle Peter also
says, 2 Pet. 1.
The prophecy came not in old time by the will of man, but holy men of God
spoke as they were moved by the holy Ghost.


Poll. No man therefore will deny that they do sometimes foretell things to come.


Cast. No man, certainly: but for what cause that is attained to, Chrysostom
does most clearly teach, in these words: It is granted, he says, that
sometimes the devil does speak truth, that he might commend his own lying with
rare verity: whereas, Why the devils sometimes tell truth.
if he should never tell the truth, he could deceive no man, neither would his
lying suffice him to tempt with. Thus far Chrysostom. Notwithstanding, if he
understand that he has not grace granted unto him of himself to foretell the
truth, he foretells things nevertheless; but so obscurely, says S.
Augustine, The Oracles of the devils are uncertain.
that he always lays the blame of the things by him so foretold, upon the
interpreter thereof. Porphyrius, in his book of Oracles, although he be the
greatest maintainer of devils, and the most expert teacher of diabolical Arts,
nevertheless he says with the aforesaid Doctors, that the foreknowledge of
things to come, is not only intricate to men, but also uncertain to the gods;
and full of many obscurities.


Poll. Thou have said, that the predictions of the devils are done in this
manner, that they may gain authority to themselves amongst the credulous
people, and be worshipped instead of Gods: for what end do the evil spirits
work Miracles?


Cast. What is a Miracle, Pollux?


Poll. A new and unwonted accident, What a Miracle is. The devils work Miracles.
which comes to pass contrary to its course and custom, and draws men into
admiration thereof.


Cast. But do they work Miracles?


Poll. They do: for whereby do thou believe that Aesculapius was honored in
his Consecration for a god, but only by the means of a Miracle, when he
conveyed a Serpent from Epidaurus to Rome? What gave so great authority to
Juno, but only the working of a Miracle? when her Image of wood was asked by
Furius Camillus whether it would be carried to Rome, and it answered with a
humane voice, It would. Also, from thence Fortune was made a goddess, because
her Statua, in the way to Latium, in the hearing of many people, not once, but
oftentimes spoke with a humane voice. In the 8 Chapter of the Acts of the
Apostles, we read of Miracles done by Simon the son of Rachel; and in Exodus 8.
of the Magicians of Pharaoh, who in the sight of many people brought forth
frogs and serpents, The Enchantments of the devils do subvert Nature.
and turned the waters into blood. Apuleus does testify the power of men to be
so great in Enchantments, that the devils do not only work Miracles by the
means of men, but they are able also to subvert Nature, and with a Demoniacal
Incantation, make violent streams to stay their course, To turn the winds, To
make the Sun stand still, To break the course of the Moon, To lay impediments
upon the Stars, To prolong the day, and to shorten the night; as Lucanus
excellently shows.

Lucan.
Cessavere vices rerum, dilataque longa,
Haesit nocte dies, legi non paruit ether,
Terruit and praeceps audito Carmine mundus.
The course of things did cease, obstructed light
Oppressed, stuck fast in duskie shades of night:
Amazed Skies their usual Laws forbear,
The world was scorched when it her charms did hear.
And Tibullus of a certain Demoniacal Charm.

Tibullus.
Hanc ego de coelo ducentem sydera vidi,
Fulminis ac rapidi Carmine vertit iter,
Haec cantu funditque solum manesque sepulchris
Elicit, and tepido devorat ossa rogo.
Cum libet haec tristi depellit lumina coelo,
Cum libet aestivo convocat orb nives.
Her have I seen draw down nights sparkling eyes,
With a dead Palsy swiftest streams surprise;
Turn earth to water, from a desert Tomb
Make the departed drowsy Manes come.
With Charms she will muffle the sad Skies in mist,
In Summer Winters snow bring when she list.

Cast. I do not any more wonder that Moses called God Wonderful, that he does
so connive at this sink of wickedness, and most wicked seducers, that he
grants them power to act such things so freely.


Poll. Firmianus excellently shows why God does so, Why God permits the
devils to work Miracles.
in his last book but one of the works of God, De opificio Dei: for he says,
that virtue is not virtue, unless it have some like, in ruling whereof it may
show and exercise its power: for he says, As Victory cannot stand without
Virtue, so neither can Virtue subsist without an Enemy; which Virtue no sooner
had the Almighty endued man withal, but he forthwith added unto him an enemy,
lest that virtue should lose its nature, being stupefied with idleness. He
says, that a man cannot otherwise attain to the highest step, unless he have
always an active hand; and that he shall establish and build up his salvation
with a continual warfare and contention: for God will not that mortal men shall
come to immortal blessedness with an easy journey, but he must wrestle and
strive with sayls and oars against the author and inventor of all evils and
errors, who causes and works execrable things and miracles.


Cast. But sometimes it comes to pass, Sometimes it comes to pass, that the
devil cannot be resisted.
that by reason of the subtle snares and stratagems of the devil, which he so
craftily prepares against us, and especially against simple persons, whom he
intangleth with vain Religions, so that we cannot resist him; or if we suppose
our selves to be very able to withstand him, yet nevertheless we shall be very
much deceived by him; as we read he oftentimes did to the good, but almost
foolish Pastor, of whom Tritemius makes mention.


Poll. But what happened to this good Pastor, and whom thou termest simple?


Cast. Tritemius says, Insomuch that he was not strong in faith, An admirable
story of a swineherd.
therefore he made more account of the name of Saint Blaze, and attributed more
power and custody unto it, then unto the name of God, the best and greatest
good.


Poll. In what manner?


Cast. He had in his walking-staff, or Pastoral Crook, a Schedule inscribed
with the name of St. Blaze; by the power and virtue of which staff, he did
believe his swine were safely defended from the ravening of the wolves: and he
did attribute so great a Deity to that Schedule, that he would leave his herd
of swine to feed in the fields alone: notwithstanding, a certain time coming
when the Pastor was absent from his flock, and a certain man coming in the mean
time, saw the devil keeping them; and he asked him what he kept here, who is
the worst persecutor of the salvation of men? He answered, I keep these swine.
The other replied, By whose command? The devil says, By the foolish confidence
the Pastor: for he included a certain Schedule in his staff, unto which he
ascribes divine virtue, or to the inscription of the name of St. Blaze; and
now, contrary to his own law, he believes that his hogs are thereby defended
from the injury of wolves; inhering to me with a false superstition; where when
he has been by me called again and again, and has not appeared, I have taken
this custody upon myself, instead of St. Blaze: for I always freely stand
instead of God and his Saints: so also now most freely do I keep his swine for
St. Blaze, that I may magnify and confirm the foolish man in his vain
confidence; and thereby I may seduce him so, that he may esteem of this
Schedule more then God.


Poll. This is a pleasant story: but I do not wonder that the devil should
impose so much upon so simple a Pastor, when he does in many things prevail
over the more wise, if they do fit themselves to his opportunities; which the
Church contradicts.


Poll. But are all things wrought and brought to pass by means of the devil,
which men call Miracles?


Cast. Some Miracles are done naturally.
No: for we must give unto Nature that which seems to belong unto her, who is
said to be the greatest worker of Miracles; as that which we have experienced
in the stone Asbestos, which, as Solinus witnesses, being once set on fire,
cannot be quenched: and the root Baara, described by Josephus in the history of
Jerusalem, which he testifies to be of the color of a flame of fire,
splendent and shining in the night; but so difficult to be taken, that it
always flies from under the hand of him that would take it, and deceives his
eyes so long, until it be sprinkled with the urine of a menstruous woman: and
when it is retained by this means, it may not be gathered or plucked up without
danger; for present death follows him that gathers or plucketh it up,
unless he shall be fortified with a Preservative about his neck, of the same
root. For which cause, they who want the same root, do scarifie it round about;
and having bound the root about with a bond, they tie the same to a dog, and
suddenly depart away. Whereupon, the dog, too much endeavoring to follow after
him, draws up the root; and, as if the dog were to perform the turn of his
Master, he forthwith dies; and afterward the same root may be taken and
handled without any danger to any man. And the same Josephus teaches, that the
same root is of such present force for expiations, that also those who are
vexed and tormented with unclean spirits, are immediately delivered, Art
sometimes imitateth Nature in working Miracles.
if they carry this root about them. Notwithstanding there is nothing
hinders, but that Art also may imitate Nature in the working of Miracles; as
we may read in Aristotle, of the Greek fire that would burn in water: of which
the said Author, in his singular Treatise concerning this, has described very
many compositions. And concerning the fire which is extinguished with oil, and
kindled with cold water, when it is besprinkled over therewith.


Poll. It sometimes happens that the devils do cloth themselves, sometimes
in more slender, and sometimes in more gross habits, that thereby they may very
much affright and molest men with horrible fantasies, and terrible sights;
with Ghosts appearing in diverse and several shapes and aspects. What, cannot we
be fortified with any thing to force and compel them to fly from us?


Cast. Origin, in his book against Celsus, says, That there is no way more
certain, How the devils are to be driven away.
then the naming of JESUS the true God. For he says he has oftentimes seen
innumerable spirits so driven away, both from the souls and bodies of men. St.
Athanasius, in his book de variis Question. testifies, that the most present
remedy against the insultation of evil spirits, is the beginning of the 67
Psalm, Let God arise, and let his enemies be scattered. Cyprian, in his book
Quod idola dii non sint, commands that the devils should be conjured away by
the true God. Some men have declared, that Fire, which is the most holy of all
enements, and the Creed, and also the instrument whereon the fire was carried,
were very profitable for this purpose: from whence, in their sacrifices about
the sepulchers of the dead, they diligently observed the use of lights: or else
from thence that Pythagorus did determine, that God could be in no wise truly
worshipped without lights burning. The Spirits fear Swords.
Some others do bind swords for this intent and purpose, taking the same out
of the 11 Ode of Homer, where be writes, that Ulysses, when he offered a
sacrifice to his mothen, had a sword drawn present by him, wherewith he
expelled and drove away the spirits from the blood of his sacrifice. And in the
sixth of Virgil, when the Sybil led Aeneas into hell, she says thus: --
Procul, O procul esto profani,
Tuque invade viam, vaginaque eripe ferrum.
Hence, hence, all ye profane! do thou invade
The way, and from 'ts confinement take thy blade.


Philostratus writes, that he compelled Apollonius, a spirit, obvious to him
and his companions, to fligh, with contumelies and direful imprecations; that
the vision making a noise, and with great horror vanished away from them. Very
many do much commend a Perfume of Calamint, Plony, Mint, Palma Christi, and
Parsley, to be used in this case. Many do keep present with them Red Coral,
Mugwort, Hypericon, Rue, or Vervin, for this purpose. Some do use for this
business the tinkling of keys, sounding of consecrated bells, or the terrible
rattling of Armor.


Poll. I have sometimes heard from our Elders, Characters do ^ive away Spirits.
that they made them Sigils inscribed with Pentagones; by virtue whereof, the
spirits might be expelled and driven away. What say thou to these?


Cast. Averrois writing against Algazelus, Characters avail not.
affirms such things to be almost nothing worth, unless to them that have
confederated with the spirits. If therefore Averrois says the truth, how then
can the devils kingdom stand, divided against it self?


Poll. But we read that Solomon, a singular man with God, did make such Sigils.


Cast. We do read truly that Solomon did make them; but it was at such time
when he worshipped Idols, and not when he was in the state of salvation.
Tertullian offe^eth a more certain Antidote then all the former, and exhorts
us, as Job, the most strong champion of God, to sight against all the assaults
of temptations: he admonishes us to be clothed with the silken garment of
Honesty, the purple-robe of Modesty and Shamefacedness, and the cloak of
Patience: and he persuades us to meditate upon all those things which the
devil does devise and invent, to overthrow our integrity; that his falling may
be proved the glory of our constancy, and that we be willing constantly to war
against all machinations, which are permitted by God for this end. And the
Prophet Jeremiah teaches the same, in these words: The Lord of hosts is the
approver of the just.

D. Maximus, in his book de charitate, commands us to bind and kill the
devils. He says we do then bind them, when by diligent observation of the
Commandments of God, we do diminish and quash those affections that do boil up
in us: And we are said to kill them, when we so truly mortify our lusts, that
we cut him of from all occasions of accusing; saying with the Prophet, Depart,
O homicide, the Lord the strong warrior is with me: thou shall fall, and shall
be vanquished from me for ever. Olympiadorus, 10. cap. when he interprets the
Ecclesiastical History, says, That all sensual appetites are to be shut out,
and excluded, so that the devil may not be admitted, neither by the allurements
of the eyes, nor by itching ears, nor by the petulancy and frowardness of a
hurtful tongue: for this he accounts to be the most absolute seal against the
power of the devils. We are to fight against the devil with two sorts of armor.
Some do admonish us, in our going forth to war against the devil, to use two
sorts of weapons: the one is pure Prayer, which may raise up our affections
unto heaven; and true and perfect knowledge, which may communicate and fill our
understandings with wholesome doctrines, and may suggest unto us what we are to
pray for, that we may pray ardently, according to St. James, and not
doubtingly. In the Prophecy of Isaiah, and the Epistles of St. Paul, we may
find the same things; Isa. 59. Ephesians. 6. and 1 Thessalonians. 5. which may be as a
remedy against vain Ghosts, that they may be expelled.


Poll. For a remedy against Ghosts? Do thou conceive that a Ghost is diverse
and different from a spirit?


Cast. I know not truly what I may think hereof: for flowing in so spacious a
Sea of many opinions, I am so led in doubt, that I cannot easily attain to a
certain Port of judgment: for there are some which do suppose that these
Ghosts are devils, by reason of the great fear and terror wherewith they
ragingly molest men by night in their houses; and sometimes for their innate
nature do do hurt. There are others that do believe these Spirits are deceitful
fantasies, deceiving those that are of evil belief; who by their fallacious
visions and imaginations do deceive and frighten the inhabitants in their
houses: and do deny that they are Spirits indeed, because the Spirits have a
body without hands and feet; wherefore they can hurt no man, nor make any
tumult: being ignorant that the Angel (who also has a body without hands and
feet) did carry Habakkuk with his whole dinner, by the hair of his head, into
Babylon, and afterward brought him back again, and set him in his own place;
neither considering that the Spirit of the Lord, also without a body, snatched
up Philip, and carried him to Azotus: that I may forbear to speak concerning a
certain incorporeal Spirit, which did so disquiet the house of my Grandfather,
that by the space of almost thirty years he caused it to be uninhabitable,
unless it were when a Lamp was burning therein; neither did that then
sufficiently quiet the same: for going out of the house, they did so mole^t
them with stones from above in the streets, that they would cast out of their
hands the hearts of Pinetrees, which they used for torches. Concerning the
Ghost that haunted the house of Anthenodorus the Philosopher, and the
tumultuous spirit of C. Caligula, there may more be spoken: but thou have
understood the relations of them already in the foregoing discourse. From all
which, we may easily convince the opinions of those, who deny that the Spirits
can walk, or make any motion; but of how much truth we may hold the assertions
of them, who do suppose that these tumultuous Spirits are neither devils, nor
phantasms, but the souls of the dead, now hearken unto.


Poll. Are there they who are of that opinion?


Cast. There are they who are of both opinions: for they do declare that these
are the souls of them who have departed from their bodies laden and clogged in
their sins; which are therefore heard to be more or less turbulent in houses,
according as they have any sensible ardent spark of that sin more or less; so
that except in the mean time they are expelled and driven away from thence, or
expiated by Alms or Intercessions, they are compelled to a certain bound of
liberty, wandering thereabouts in expectation of the last Judgment.


Poll. Wherefore?


Cast. Because I believe that the souls of them which sleep in Christ do live
with Christ, Lactan. o^ the souls of the dead.
and do not wander about the earth; and the souls of them who are oppressed and
burdened with the grievous weight of their sins, since they are the members of
Satan, are bound with Satan in the chains of darkness, expecting judgment in
hell.


Poll. But Firmianus, a Writer of no mean judgment, thinks the contrary, in
his Book which he has written de Divino premio.


Cast. How is that?


Poll. The opinion of Firmianus.
These are his words: Let not any man conceive that the souls of the dead are
judged immediately after death: for they are all detained in one common
custody, until the time shall come, wherein the Almighty Judge shall make
examination and inquisition of their deeds. Then they who shall he found
righteous, shall receive the reward of immortality; but they whose sins and
wickedness shall then be detected, shall not arise again, but shall be enclosed
with the wicked in darkness, and destined to eternal punishments.


Cast St. Augustine subscribeth to Lactantius in his Enchiridion, saying, That
the time which is interposed between the death of mankind and the last
resurrection, contains the souls in secret hidden receptacles, where every
soul receives condign rest or misery, for the good or evil which he did in
the body while he lived.


Poll. Neither does St. Ambrose disagree from this: in his second book of Cain
and Abel, he says, That the soul is loosed from the body, and after the end of
this life, is suspended to the ambiguous time of the last judgment.


Cast. So also some have declared, that the soul of Trajanus Caesar did wander
about; but the soul of St. George was freed from such suffrage.


Poll. Thou have even now spoke, and that truly, that spacious is the sea of
various opinions concerning these Spirits; for so indeed it is: but what Port
thou touchest at, I desire thee it may not seem troublesome to thee to tell me:
for I am not as yet satisfied of the certainty hereof by our discourse.


Cast. That which thou desire, I conceive to be this: I hold that these
tumultuous Spirits are mere images of Satan; which are not to be feared,
neither is there any credit to be given to their answers: and are in no wise
the souls of the dead, which either live with Christ, if they have done well;
or else are bound in chains with Satan, if they have done evil.


Poll. It remains that we sist out this, Castor: for it happens now
sometimes, that my father appears to me in my sleep; perhaps that may also
seem unto thee to be a Spirit.


Cast. It may seem so: but I will not in any thing contradict thee beyond
Reason: of my self I will add nothing; but at leastwise I will annihilate thy
opinion with the assertions of St. Augustine.


Poll. What assertions are those?


Cast. In his 11 Book, which he intituleth De mortuorum cura, he offers them
as a means, saying, Humane infirmity does so believe of himself, that when he
sees any one that is dead, in his sleep, he supposes that he sees the soul
of that dead person; but when he dreameth of any one that is alive, he then is
out of doubt, that neither his soul nor his body, but the similitude of the man
appeared unto him: As if they could be ignorant, that the souls of dead men do
not appear unto them in dreams, but only the similitudes of the persons
deceased. And he proves both these to be done, by two examples which were at
Mediolanus; whereof the first he shows to have been the image of a certain
father that was dead, who appeared to his son, admonishing him that he should
not pay again a debt to an unjust Creditor, which the father had paid him
before: for he says the Case was thus: The father had paid a debt to a certain
Creditor, which after the death of the father, the Creditor endeavored by
force to recover the same again of his son, who was ignorant of the payment
thereof: to whom the image of his father appeared when he was sleeping, and
showed him where the Writing was hid. Whereupon, the son awakening from his
sleep, sought for the Paper in the place he was directed, and sound it, and
thereby overthrew the malice of his deceitful Creditor. The second example is,
whereby the same St. Augustine shows that the living do appear to the living,
in their sleep: for he says, That Eurologius the Rhetorician, professing the
Rhetoric of Cicero at Carthage, he found a difficult and obscure place that
was not declared to him; so that waking and sleeping he vexed himself by reason
of his ignorance: but, in a certain night, the image of Aurelius Augustine
appeared to him, and taught him in what manner the dark and difficult place was
to be understood.


Poll. Augustine does therefore conclude, without doubt, that they are not
souls.


Cast. He does so conclude: and the greater to strengthen such his judgment,
he adds, That if the souls of the dead have any interest or counsel in the
affairs of the living, he undoubtedly knew, that his own pious mother did not
desert him, not for one night, but when she was living, followed him both by
sea and land: neither did he at any time sustain any anguish of heart, but
comforted his sorrows. And that this may not seem too hard a speech, the
president of Christ teaches, that they do not err, who affirm that the good
Angels, by the appointment of God, and Divine dispensation, do sometimes come
to, and visit men, both living and sleeping, and sometimes to the place where
souls endure punishment: notwithstanding, it is not unto all, but only unto
those who have so lived, that God shall judge them worthy of this mercy; or
unto those upon whom, without any respect unto their deserts, God will be
pleased to glorify his unspeakable mercy; that by the prayers of the living
they may obtain pardon of their sins, and deliverance from the prison of
torments.


Poll. I have sometimes read, that the same St. Augustine did write, that it is
better for a man to doubt of secret things, then to contend about things
uncertain.


Cast. That is certainly true; neither does he declare himself to be an offense
to those who do leave all these things to the unsearchable judgments of God,
and labor not to find out the secrets thereof.


Poll. Whether the devils work Miracles really, or not.
Because I have easily understood thy answers hitherto, I will not desist till
thou have fully resolved me concerning this subject. I desire therefore to know
whether all Miracles which the devils perform, are done really, or imaginary
fantasies.


Cast. That they perform many things really, and many things only seemingly, we
have already manifested out of the Writings of St. Augustine. For that great
Prelate of the Christian Church, writes, in the 11 Chapter of his book de
Trinitate, That it is a very easy thing for the wicked Spirits, through the
aerie substance of their bodies, to perform many things which seem wonderful
(to the souls that are oppressed with earthly bodies) to be done. He also
says, That earthly bodies may be so qualified with art and exercise, that in
public Theaters they may perform such wonderful things, that those who never
have seen them will not believe them, but that they were done by the assistance
of the devil and his ministers, to make their bodies of such an aerie element,
that the flesh wonders at. Or else, which is much, he says also, That they do
contrive with occult inspirations, forms, and fantasies of images, to delude
humane sense; wherewith, waking or sleeping, they may be deceived. Thus far
Augustine. But, if thou will, I will produce also another witness without
exception, Pollux.


Poll. I would have thee tell me who that is.


Cast. Abbas Tritemius, in his third Question to St. Maximus Emilianus, which
is spoken of before, says thus: The devils, amongst unfaithful people, do seem
to raise up the dead to life, and to show miracles to curious men, that they
might as it were swallow them up with error in stead of miracles; The devils
cannot really raise the dead.
and are altogether pertinacious and obstinate: but they cannot truly and
really raise up the dead, but do variously deceive the senses of men, showing
them feigned resemblances of the dead. For it is certainly manifest, that the
devils can do all things, but only in a false similitude of holy miracles in
truth.


Poll. Some say that the devils are obedient to wicked men, because of the
similitude of their malice. How seems that to thee?


Cast. It seems to me, that they are obedient to evil men, but not to all men.


Poll. But to whom?


Cast. To those certainly with whom they have contracted and made compacts and
covenants; as those women which they call Pythonists are accounted, who have
vowed themselves by promise unto him.


Poll. But although they are compelled to be so serviceable unto them, yet is
this service true or feigned?


Cast. It is feigned, certainly: for they are subservient unto men of their own
accord, and genuine wo^k, that they may deceive them, and allure them to
themselves. Although we do not deny that their service is sometimes true, but
only toward those men, whose faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, by the merit of
his holiness, has caused them to be acceptable, and friends unto him. And that
Lactantius also testifies, in these words, in his second book De origin
Erroris, and 16 Chapter, That the devils do fear the just, that is, those that
worship God, in whose Name they are conjured to depart out of bodies, and with
whose words they are beaten as it were with scourges: and they do not only
confess that they are devils, but do declare their names: neither can they lie
unto the just. And the same Lactantius in his fourth book De vera Sapientia,
Chap. 27. says, That it is necessary that they who are of the true Christian
Religion, should know the course and order of the devils, and understand their
subtilty, and restrain their force, and conquer and subdue them with spiritual
weapons, and force them to obey them.


Poll. I am now by thee sufficiently informed of all things which I have
hitherto desired to know; wherefore I shall not any further trouble thee with
my Questions, or rather Riddles, but leave thee to thy own occasions.


Cast. Neither have I counted my self idle in answering thee: but let the use
thereof yield us each to other an equal recompense. Farewell therefore.


Poll. And thee also.


GERARD CREMONENSIS OF ASTRONOMICAL GEOMANCY.
BEcause Astronomy is so transcendent and subtle an Art in it self, that
therein a man ought to have respect unto so many things before he can attain to
true judgment thereby, because the eye of the understanding will not pierce
unto the half thereof, and few Doctors of our later time have been found so
experienced therein, that they know sufficiently how to judge thereby;
Therefore I have composed this work, which I will have to be named,
Astronomical Geomancy; wherein, I will sufficiently teach how to judge with
less labor and study. For in this present Science it is not requisite to
behold neither the Ascendent, nor the hour in a Table, as it is in Astrology.

It is expedient therefore, to make four unequal lines, by the points casually
set down; and to join together those points; and out of the points which are
not joined together, which do remain in the heads of the lines, (as it is done
in Geomancy) extract one figure; and the sign of the Zodiac that answers to
that figure, put for the Ascendent, for the words sake. If Acquisitio arise
from the heads of those four Lines, let Aries be placed in the Ascendent; if
Laetitia, or the lesser Fortune put Taurus in the Ascendent; if Puer or Rubeus,
place Gemini; if Albus, Cancer; if Via, Leo; if Conjunctio or the Dragons Head,
Virgo; if Puella, Libra; if Amissio or Tristitia, Scorpio; if the Dragons Tail,
Sagittary; if Populus, Capricorn; if Fortuna major, Aquary; if Career, then put
Pisces for the Ascendent. Afterward in the second House, let that sign be
placed which immediately succeeds the other. In the third House the third Sign,
and so place the rest in order until you come unto the end of the Signs; and
make one square figure divided into twelve equal parts, and therein place the
Signs in order, as it is in Astrology, and as you may find them in this
figure: neither are we here to regard the * witnesses, or * Judge, or any other
thing which belongs to Geomancy; but only the sixteen Figures, that by them we
may have the twelve Signs, to which they agree; and observe the manner of the
Figure as it is here placed.

Look how the twelve Signs are placed in the figure, and so may any other Sign
be ascending in his turn, as Aries is here.






Afterward it is requisite to make four Lines by course for every Planet, by
points casually pricked down; and likewise for the Dragons Head, as you have
done for the Ascendent, and divide those points by twelve; and that which
remains above twelve, or the twelfth it self, if a greater number does not
remain, retain, and the Planet for which the projection was made, place in that
House of which the superabounding number shall be; that is, if there remain
twelve, let the Planet be placed in the twelfth House; if ten, in the tenth
House; if one, in the first House; if two, in the second House; and so of the
rest. And you ought always to begin from the Sun, and afterward from the
Moon, then from Venus and Mercury, and from Saturn, Jupiter and Mars, and the
Dragons Head and Dragons Tail; but you must always take heed, that you do not
make a question in a rainy, cloudy, or a very windy season, or when thou art
angry, or thy mind busied with many affairs; nor for tempters or deriders,
neither that you may renew and reiterate the same Question again under the same
figure or form; for that is error.

Questions of the first House.
IF you are desirous to know concerning the life of any man whether it shall be
long or short, behold the Lord of the Ascendent, who if he be in strong Angles,
it signifies long life; in succedents, a middle age; and in cadent Houses, a
short life; and if he be in strong Angles, he signifies greater years; if in
Succedents, meaner years; if in Cadents, lesser years. The lesser years of
Saturn are thirty, the meaner are forty four years, and the greater fifty
eight. The lesser years of Jupiter are twelve, the meaner years forty, and the
greater, accordingly are forty seven. The lesser years of Mars are fifteen, his
means years forty, and the greater years forty seven. The lesser years of the
Sun are nineteen, his mean years forty five, and his greater years eighty two.
The lesser years of Venus are eight, her mean years forty five, and her greater
years eighty two. Mercury's lesser years are twenty, his means years forty
nine, and his greater years eighty. The lesser years of the Moon are fifteen,
her mean years thirty nine, and her greater years a hundred and seven. And also
look if Mars or Saturn shall be in the first House, and the Lord of the eighth
with them; and if the Sun shall be in the eighth, the Querent shall not live:
likewise if the Lord of the Ascendent shall happen to be void of course, and
Mars be in the eighth, the Querent shall not live; but if the Sun and the Moon
shall be in conjunction in the seventh House, and Venus in the second, he shall
live well.

The accidents of the nativity are likewise to be considered. If you find
Saturn or Mercury in the first, * he is foolish and talkative; if it be Mars
and Mercury, he will not be servile, but a wrangler and scoffer; if the Sun and
Mercury, he will be a speaker of truth; and if the Sun be in Aries, he will
apply himself to learn whatsoever he shall hear; if Venus be in the seventh, he
will be luxurious; and if Saturn, Mercury and Venus be in their fall, he will
be a Sodomite; if the Sun and Venus be in the tenth, and the Moon in the first,
he will be very liberal; if Venus, Mercury and the Dragons Head be in the
first, he will be covetous; if the Moon and Mars be in the first, he will be
subject to great bondage; and if Mars be Lord of the nativity, he will be rich,
and an evil speaker, and litigious; and if the Sun be in the first, he will be
envious, having a fair body, not very lean, nor very fat; and if Venus be in
the first, he will be white and fair; if Mercury be in the first, he will not
be stable, but always in motion; but if the Moon be found there, it denotes
him to have a graceful face, breast and arms; if Saturn be there, the man will
be black and filthy; if Jupiter, he will have a round face, a fair forehead, a
ruddy complexion mixed with a little white. If you would know his office or art:
if the Moon be in the seventh with Saturn, or in the fourth, or in the tenth,
or in the first, it is not good for him to build any house in a City, nor to
build a ship, neither is it good for him to be a tiller of land, or to dress
vines, or plant trees; but to be employed about some office belonging to the
water, or concerning marriages, or to be a Post or a Messenger; neither let him
apply himself much to his master, because he shall gain no repute from him: if
the Moon be in the fifth or third, it will be good to him; in the second,
eighth, sixth and twelfth, neither good nor evil.

Jupiter signifies Bishops, Prelates, Nobles, Potentates, Judges, Wise men,
Merchants and Usurers.

Mars signifies Warriors, Incendiaries, Homicides, Physicians, Barbers,
Hangmen, Goldsmiths, Cooks, furnaces, and all fireworks. And if Mars be in
strong Signs, he will be poor and die in captivity, unless he put himself in
arms with some soldier or vassal.

The Sun signifies Emperors, Kings, Princes, Nobles, Lords, and Judges.

Venus signifies Queens and Ladies, Marriages, Communications, Friendship,
Apothecaries, Tailors, and such as make Ornaments for Plays, sellers of Cloth,
Jesters, Vintners, Players at dice, Whores and Robbers.

Mercury signifies Clerks, Philosophers, Astrologers, Geometricians,
Arithmeticians, Latin writers, and Painters, and all subtle Artists, as well
men as women, and their Arts.

Concerning the intention of the Querent, look unto the Sign ascending, and his
Lord; and where you find, the Lord of the Ascendent, he comes to inquire about
something pertaining to that House; and if the Sun be Lord of the Ascendent,
his Question is concerning fear which he is in of some man; if Venus, he
enquireth of Arts, that he may know some proper Arts, or he enquireth
concerning things belonging to women. If Mercury be Lord of the Ascendent, he
seeks after something that is lost, or enquireth concerning some infirmity.
If the Moon, he seeks also for something lost, or enquireth about sickness,
or some disease in his eyes. If Saturn be Lord of the Ascendent, he enquireth
about some sickness, or concerning a Prince; and keppeth silence, but has some
great grief or anguish in his heart. If Jupiter be Lord of the Ascendent, his
Question is concerning some infirmity, or restitution, or for some office which
he desires to have. If Mars, he enquireth for some fear, or of an enemy,
death, sickness, riches, or substance.

Questions of the second House.
IF you would be informed concerning the substance of any man whether he shall
be rich or not, behold the Lord of the second, which if he shall be with a good
Planet, and a good Planet likewise in the second, he shall be rich; but if the
Lord of the second be joined with evil Planets, and an evil Planet shall be in
the second, he shall be poor.

If you would know whether you shall have again a thing lent, or not, look if
there be an evil Planet in the second, and disagreeing with his Lord; then he
that detaineth the thing lent, will not willingly render back the same: but if
there be a good Planet in the second, and agreeing with his Lord, it shall
easily be recovered; and if the Lord of the second be exalted and be evil, or
if an evil Planet be with him in the second, or if the Lord of the second be
exalted, he which keeps the thing deposited, will not willingly restore the
same, but he shall do it whether he will or not. And if an evil Planet be in
the second, it is to be recovered: but if Mercury be in the second, so that he
be his Lord, and brings contrariety then it shall be recovered; and if a good
Planet be in the second House, he signifies recovery, although he be the Lord
thereof.

Mark therefore the concord and discord of the Planets: the Moon and Jupiter
are friends, the Moon and Mars enemies; Mercury and the Sun are friends,
Mercury and Venus enemies; Venus and Jupiter are friends, Jupiter and the Moon
are enemies.

The Planets are said to be friends, when they agree in one nature and quality,
as Mars and the Sun, because both their natures are hot and dry; Venus and the
Moon do agree in cold and moisture: or when Planets do agree in substance and
nature, as Jupiter and Venus are friends: or when the House of one is the
exaltation of another, or on the contrary.

Questions of the third House.
IF that you desire to know, how many brethren a man has, see the Lord of the
third, and it is to be held, that to so many Planets as he is joined, so many
brethren the Querent has; and the Masculine Planets signify brethren, and the
female Planets sisters; and note, That Saturn and Mars, the Sun, Jupiter, and
the Dragons Head, are masculine; but the Moon, Venus and the Dragons Tail are
foeminine: but Mercury is promiscuous, sometimes masculine, and sometimes
foeminine: he is masculine when he is joined to masculine Planets, or when he
is in a masculine quarter of the Zodiac; and he is foeminine, when he is
joined to foeminine Planets, or when he is in a foeminine quarter of the
Zodiac.

Questions of the fourth House.
IF thou would know whether it be good for thee to stay in any Land, City,
Village, Territory, or House, or not, behold the Lord of the Ascendent of the
fourth, and of the seventh; and if the Lord of the fourth be in the seventh,
and be good, and the Lords of the first and the tenth House be good, and with
good Planets, then it is good for thee to continue in that place wherein thou
art. And if the Lord of the seventh be with a good Planet, and the Lord of the
fourth with an evil Planet, then it is not good for thee to abide there,
because if thou do continue there, thou shall suffer many losses, and have
evil reports raised on thee in that Country.

But if thou would know when any one that is absent will return, behold the
Lord of the Ascendent; and if you find him in any one of the four Angles, he
will return in that year; and if he be not in an Angle, then see how far he is
distant from the first Angle; for so long he will stay, and so many years as
there be Houses.

If you would be informed of the dearth or plenty of things, behold the strong
Houses, the Succedents and the Cadents; for the strong Houses signify dearth
and scarcity, the Succedents a moderate season, neither too dear, nor too
cheap, the Cadents signify plenty and profitableness of things. Consider also
the Planets, and their places, which if they be in strong Houses, the things
which are signified by those Planets will be rare: and note, That Saturn does
signify fields, vines, and instruments to work in fields, and leather, and of
fruits, corn, acorns, oak-apples, and pomegranates. Jupiter has oil, honey,
silk-wormes, cloth, wine, and grass, and things that are odoriferous. Mars
signifies wine, and flesh, and especially hogs, wars, and armor, and such
things as belong thereunto, and red garments. The Sun has signification of
wheat, and wine, purple colors, and cloth, and all things that are assimulated
unto gold, horses and birds, such as hawks and falcons. Venus does signify
fatness and grapes, figs and dates, fish and pastimes. Mercury has barley,
millet, grain, money, and quicksilver. The Moon signifies oats, milk, cheese,
fire and salt, cows, rams, hens, and silver, and accordingly plenty and
scarcity of them.

Questions of the fifth House.
IF you would know whether a woman be with Child, or whether she will have any
children, or not, look if the Lord of the Ascendent be in the seventh, or the
Lord of the fifth in the first, or the Lord of the first in the fifth, or if
the Lord of the fifth be in the seventh, or if the Lord of the seventh be in
the fifth, or the Moon with them; or if good Planets be in the first, or the
fifth, or with the Lord of the fifth, or * R. in Angles, she is with child, or
may have children; but if you find none of them, but evil Planets in the same
places, she neither is with child, neither will she have any children: and if
there be both good and evil Planets in the said places, then happily she may
have children, but they will not live; but if Cancer, Scorpio or Pisces shall
be in the first or fifth House, she may have children; but if Leo and Virgo be
there, she is not with child, neither shall she ever have any children; or if
the Lord of the fifth shall be in them Houses.

And if you would know, within how many years she shall have children, look
where you find the Lord of the fifth; for in that year she shall have issue;
if he be in the first, in the first year; if in the second, in the second year;
and so you may number unto the twelfth House. And if mean Signs be in the
Ascendent, she that is with child has twins in her womb, which will live, if
a good Planet be in the first; and if an evil Plahet, they will die; and if
there be one good and another evil, one shall live, and another die; and if a
mean Sign shall be ascending, and Mars in that Sign, the mother shall die, and
not the child; if Saturn, both the mother and child shall die; and if the
Dragons Tail be there, it is possible they will both die; but the infant shall
not escape: and if the Dragons Tail be so in the first, and the tenth House
fallen, the mother shall die; likewise if Mars and the Moon, or Mars and Saturn
be in the first, seventh or tenth, the mother shall die.

Whether the party with child shall miscarry or not. Consider if a moveable
Sign be ascending, because if it be so, she will miscarry.

If you would know whether a woman shall bring forth a man-child, or a
woman-child; behold the Ascendent and his Lord, which if he be masculine, and
in a masculine Sign, or in a masculine quarter of the Figure, it is a
male-child; but if the Lord of the Ascendent be feminine, and in a feminine
Sign, or in a feminine quarter of the Circle, it will be a woman child; and so
you shall consider also of the Moon. Consider also if more of the Planets be in
masculine Signs, then it will be a male-child; and if many Planets be in
feminine Signs, then it is a female-child.

And if you would know whether the child be legitimate or adulterate; see if
Saturn, Mars or the Dragons Tail be in the fifth, or with the Lord of the
fifth; because if it be so, it is adulterate; but if a good Planet shall be
there, it is legitimate: and if the Lord of the first be in the fifth, or with
his Lord, it is legitimate; and so likewise if the Lord of the fifth be found
in the first, or with the Lord of the first.

If you desire to know whether rumors be true or false, see if you find
Saturn, Mars or the Dragons Tail, in the Ascendent; because if they be so, then
the rumors are false; but if you find the Sun, Jupiter or the Dragons Head
there, then they are true; and if there be masculine Planets in masculine
Signs, and feminine Planets in feminine Signs, then they are true; and if
both good and evil Planets be there, then they are partly true and partly
false; and if there be a good Sign with the Planet, it testifies the truth; and
if the Planet fall with an evil Sign, then it is false; likewise if Mercury be
in the first, the news is false: but if the Moon be in the first in a feminine
Sign, or joined with the Lord of the Ascendent in a feminine Sign, then the
rumors are true; also if good Planets be in the first, fifth or ninth, and
feminine Signs, they are true; but if otherwise, they are not.

If you would know whether any one that is absent will return, and when; see
the Lord of the Ascendent and the first, which if you find them together, for
certain he will come, and is now beginning his Journey. Likewise if the Lord of
the fifth be in the first, or with the Lord of the first, and if he be in his
fall, the messenger is sick in his way; but if the Lord of the fifth be
exalted, then he comes joyfully. And if he be in a cadent Sign, he shall be
grievously afflicted with sickness, or shall die.

If you would know if he brings that with him for which he went, or not,
behold the Lord of the seventh; which if he be good, he brings that which he
sought for; and if he be in his fall, or an evil Planet be there, he brings
nothing with him.

Questions of the sixth House.
WHether the sick shall recover his health, or die. If the Question be
concerning his sickness, see if Saturn, or Mars, or the Dragons Tail be in the
first, and whether his Lord be joined with an evil Planet, then he shall die
soon. And if the Lord of the first be good, and evil Planets be in the first
with his Lord, or likewise in the first or the eighth, for certain he will die:
But if the Lord of the first be in the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth;
or the Lord of the eighth in the first, or with the Lord of the first, there is
doubt of his death. And if evil Planets do possess the Angles, evil and
destruction is threatened to the sick. But if good Planets shall be in the
first, sixth and eighth, and likewise in the Angles, and the Lord of the first
be from the eighth and his Lord, then the sick person shall live and recover
his health.

If you desire to know whether he will be cured by medicines, give the first
House to the Physician, the tenth to the sick, the seventh to his diseases, and
the fourth to the medicines. If evil Planets be in the first, the Physician
shall profit him nothing; but they testify that this will be worse for the
diseased: but the Fortunes do signify, that he shall be profitable to him. And
if evil Planets do occupy the tenth House, the sick person is the cause; for
they testify, that he himself is the cause of his own disease: but the
Fortunes being there, signify the contrary. But if evil Planets be in the
tenth House, they change the condition of the sick out of one disease into
another; but the Fortunes being there, do deliver him without the help of
Physicians or medicines. Also evil Planets being in the fourth, do testify,
that the medicines do augment his grief; and the Fortunes being there, do
mitigate and heal him.

If thou would know if thou shall go unto the person and heal him; consider
the place then: for if he shall be with Saturn, Mars, or the Dragons Tail, or *
R * with the Sun, go not unto him; but if Jupiter, Venus or the Dragons Head be
in the first or in the seventh, go, for it will be good: and if there be the
Moon with a good Planet, go, and give him physic; but if she shall be with an
evil Planet, and especially in the seventh House, then thou shall not go,
because thou shall profit him nothing: and if there be good Planets there, go
and look diligently to him, where or in what members he suffers; because Aries
has the head, Taurus the neck, Cancer the breast and lungs, Leo the heart and
stomach, Virgo the belly and intestines, Libra the reins and loins, Scorpio the
secret members, Sagittary the thighs, Capricorn the knees, Aquary the legs, and
Pisces the feet.

Questions of the seventh House.
FOr theft, look unto the Lord of the seventh: which if he be in the first, the
theft shall be restored again; but if the Lord of the first be in the seventh,
it shall be a long time sought after, and at length shall be found: but if the
Moon be in the first, or with his Lord, it shall be found; if the Moon be in
the fifth, or with the Lord of the first, or * R * in the first, it may be
found; but if the Sun and the Moon be in the fifth, and if the Lord of the
eighth be with the Lord of the first with the first, it shall be found; but if
the Lord of the second be in the eighth, it shall not be found. And if Saturn,
or Mars, or the Dragons Tail be in the second, it shall not be found, nor be
altogether lost. And if the Lord of the second be in the first, the thing that
is lost shall be found; but it shall not be known from whence it came. If the
Lord of the first be in the second, it may be found after much labor. And if
the Lord of the second be in his fall, it will never be found; but if he be
exalted, it shall be found very well: but the seventh House shows the thief.

But if you would know what it is that is stolen, behold the Lord of the
second; which if he be Saturn, it is lead, iron, a kettle, a trivet, a garment,
or some black thing, or leather. If he be Jupiter, then it is some white thing,
as tin, silver, or mixed with white and yellow veins. The Sun signifies gold and
precious pearls. Mars signifies things belonging to the fire. Venus signifies
things belonging to women, as gloves, rings, and fair ornaments. The Moon,
beasts, such as horses, mules, etc. perfumes and wars. Mercury signifies money,
books, writings, pictures, or garments of diverse colors.

If you would know how many thieves there were, see the Lord of the sixth;
which if he be in the second, or with the Lord of the second, there were many
thieves; and if they be in the third, the brethren or kinsmen of the Querent
have committed the theft.

If you would know whether the thief do yet remain in the Town: if they be in
succedent Houses, he is not gone far off; but if they be in cadent Houses, he
is far remote.

If you desire to know toward what Country the thief is fled, see in what Sign
the Lord of the seventh is; for if he be in Aries, he is in the middle of the
East part. If in Taurus, in the South toward the East. If in Gemini, in the
West toward the South. If in Cancer, full North. If in Leo, in the East
toward the North. If in Virgo, in the South toward the West. If in Libra,
full West. If in Scorpio, in the North near the West. If in Sagittary, in the
East nigh the North. If in Capricorn, full South. If in Aquary, in the West
toward the North. And if in Pisces, in the North toward the West.

If you would know whether the thief has carried all the things stolen away
with him, see the Lord of the seventh and the eighth; and if the Lord of the
seventh be in an Angle, he had a desire to carry away the same with him, but
could not. If the Lord of the eighth be in a mean House, or in a cadent House,
and the Lord of the second in a strong House, he has carried the theft wholly
with him. And if the Lord of the seventh and the eighth be both in cadent
Houses, he neither carried it away, nor has it. See by the seventh who is his
companion, and what is his gain.

If you would know the descent or nobility of a man or woman, look unto the
Lord of the seventh; which if you find him in Angles, and the Lord of the
first in Succedents or Cadents, the woman is more noble then the man. But if
the Lord of the Ascendent be in an Angle, and the Lord of the seventh in a
succedent or cadent House, the man is more noble then the woman. And after the
same manner thou may judge of two companions, or of any other persons
whatsoever. And if the Lord of the seventh be in the ninth House, he will take
a wife out of a foreign Country.

If you desire to know whether an intended marriage shall take effect, or not,
look to the Ascendent and his Lord, and the Moon, for the Querent; and the
seventh House, and his Lord, for the woman. And if the Lord of the Ascendent or
the Moon be joined to the Lord of the seventh, or be in the seventh, the
marriage will be effected; or if the Lord of the seventh be in the first, or
with the Lord of the first, it will easily be brought to pass; and the woman is
more desirous thereof, then the man.

If you would know whether thy wife or friend has any other lover or not, look
if Mars be in the seventh, so that he be not in his own House, for then she
has not any other lover. And if Saturn be there, she loves another; but he
lies not with her. And if the Dragons Tail be in the seventh, he lies with
her. And if Jupiter be there, she hardly contains her self chaste. If Venus,
she is merry, and much given to play and laughter, by reason whereof, she may
be accounted a whore, and is not so. If Mercury be in the seventh, she had a
lover, but now has none. But if the Moon be in the seventh, she has had no
lover as yet, but will have one, and will be common. But if the Sun or the
Dragons Head be there, she is chaste. And after the same manner may you Judge
in the * ninth * concerning friends or lovers.

If you would know which of them shall live longest, see the Lord of the first
and of the seventh, which of them shall be in the stronger and better place, or
joined to the strongest Planets; and that person who is most free and remote
from the Lord of the eighth and his participation, to whom the Lord of his
House answers, shall live longest.

If you desire to make a society or alliance, and would know whether it shall
be brought to pass or not, or what shall happen thereupon, see if there be good
Planets in the seventh and the first: and if so, the fellowship will be made,
and good will come thereof; and you may judge it to continue so many years,
months or days, as the Lord of the seventh has signification of.

If you would know when such society shall be, look what Planet is in the
seventh; for if he be good, it shall come to pass that same year: or wedlock, *
R Ibidem forte.
if the Question be thereof.

If you would know whether they will well agree, see the first and his Lord,
which is the signifier of the Querent; and the seventh House and his Lord,
which is the House of companions, wives and concubines; which if they be
concordant amongst themselves, there will be peace and union between them, and
they shall profit: but if the Planets be in discord, there will be strife
between them, and the society will not profit.

If you would know which of them shall gain most, see the first and his Lord,
and the seventh and his Lord, and which of them stands best; or if they be
evil, which of them falls: and he that falls shall lose, and he that is
exalted shall gain. Or otherwise, and which is better, see the second and his
Lord, and the eighth and his Lord; and in which House is the better Planet, or
his Lord that shall be found in the better place, or joined with the better
Planets, he shall be the greater gainer. The second House and his Lord
signifies the gain of the Querent: and the eighth House and his Lord signifies
the gain of his fellow, or his part: and if they be both good, they shall both
gain; and if both evil, they shall both lose: and if one be good and the other
evil, he whose significator is good, shall gain; and he whose is evil, shall
lose.

And if you would know if two fellows shall love one another, look if the Lords
of the first and the seventh be friends and agreeing, then they will love one
another; but if they be enemies and disagree, then they will not.

If you desire to know who shall overcome in any cause, matter or controversy,
behold the Lords of the first and the seventh, which if they be in Angles,
neither of them shall overcome; and see which of them is joined with an evil
Planet, because he shall overcome; and if the Planet be evil from them both,
the victor shall kill the conquered; if one of them be strong, and the other
weak, and the Planet which is in the strong House do not fall, nor has not an
evil Planet with him; and if he which is weak be not in his own House, nor in
his exaltation, nor with a good Planet, he whose Planet is in the strong House,
shall overcome; likewise he whose significator is in a mean House, shall have
great fear and doubt in his heart, because sometimes he shall hope to conquer,
and otherwhiles fear to be overcome. And note, that in a Question concerning
war and kingdom, it is said that there is more power and efficacy, or
fortitude in the exaltation of a Planet, then in his House; but in all other
Questions the contrary.

If you would be informed concerning any one being that is gone to any fight,
whether he shall return safe, see the Lord of the Ascendent; if he be good,
that is, with good Planets, and a good Planet in the first, he will return
safe; but if the Sun be with the Lord of the first, in any part of the
Question, let him not go, because the Sun burns him. And if the Lord of the
seventh be with a good Planet, and the Lord of the first with a good Planet
likewise, he shall have some impediment in the way; but he will not die. And if
an evil Planet be with the Lord of the first, and a good Planet in the first,
if he goes he shall suffer great damage, but not death; nevertheless he may be
grievously wounded. And if Saturn be in the first, or with the Lord of the
first, let him not go; because some impediment will happen unto him by some man
that he will meet. And if there be an evil Planet with the Lord of the first,
or Saturn be in the first, or with the Lord of the first, he will be wounded
with wood or with a stone. If Mars and the Dragons Tail be in the first, or
with the Lord of the first; or if there evil Planets in the first, or with the
Lord of the first, he will suffer wounds or death. See likewise if there be an
evil Planet in the eighth, because then death is to be feared. And if the Sun
be with the Lord of the seventh, or in the eighth, it signifies that it is ill
to go. The like judgment is of the seventh and the tenth.

And if a Question be proposed concerning the event of War, see the seventh and
the first, and their Lords: for the first House and his Lord signifies the
Querent; and the seventh House and his Lord the adversary. So that if there be
good Planets in the first, and evil in the seventh; and if the Lord of the
first and seventh be evil, the Querent shall overcome: but if there be an evil
Planet with the Lord of the first, and an evil Planet in the first, and the
Lord of the seventh good, or * R * in the seventh, the Querent shall be
overcome, or taken, or slain. And if the Lords of them both be in the first,
and there be good Planets from the part of the first House, unto the end of the
House which is the middle of the Question; and if evil Planets do possess the
other half of the Question, that is to say, from the seventh unto the end of
the twelfth house, the adversary shall overcome. But if both the Lords shall be
in the Ascendent, and if they be good from the part of the first, and evil from
the part of the seventh, they shall both suffer great loss; but the Querent
shall have the better in the end. But if the Lord of the Ascendent be in the
seventh, or in his Question, it signifies fortitude of the adversary: and if
the Lord of the seventh be in the first, or in his Question, it signifies
fortitude of the actor. And if the Lord of the Ascendent be in the eighth, or
with the Lord of the eighth; or the Lord of the eighth in the first, or with
the Lord of the first, it signifies the death of the Querent. And if the Lord
of the seventh be in the second, or with his Lord; or the Lord of the second in
the seventh, or with the Lord of the seventh, it signifies the death of the
enemy.

If you would know whether War shall continue long or not, if mean or meanly;
if the Lords of the first and the seventh do agree, the parties shall be
pacified after the War.

If thou would depart from the place wherein thou art, and remove thy self to
some other place; and if thou would know whether it be better for thee to
stay or go: or concerning two businesses, if thou destrest to know which of
them is most expedient for thee to undertake, consider the Lords of the first
and the second, for those places to which thou would go, the place wherein
thou art, and the gain which thou gettest there; and the seventh and the
eighth, and their Lords, for the place to which thou would go, and the gain
which thou may get there: and those places choose, whose Lords are the better,
or joined to the better Planets. Or otherwise: behold the Lord of the
Ascendent, and the Moon; which if they be separated from evil Planets, and
joined to good and fortunate Planets, it is better for thee to go from the
place where thou art, then to stay there, and to do what business soever thou
have in thy mind. And if the Lord of the Ascendent and the Moon be separated
from the Fortunes, and joined to evil Planets, then it is not good for thee to
remove thy self, nor to do thy business. Or thus: See the Moon; and if the
Planet from which she is separated be better then that to whom she is joined,
do not remove: and if the Planet which she is joined to, be better then that
from which she is separated, then go.

Questions of the eighth House.
COncerning any man or woman, if you would know what kind of death they shall
die, see if Leo, Scorpio, R. Mars, be in the eighth, the party shall die by a
beast. And if Saturn be in the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth in
Scorpio, Cancer, or Pisces, he shall die in water. And if an evil Planet be in
the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth; or if Mars or the Dragons Tail be
there, he shall die by fire, iron, or of a fever. And if there be a good Planet
in the eighth, or with the Lord of the eighth, he shall die a good death.

Questions of the ninth House.
COncerning long journeys, see if the Lord of the eighth has good Planets with
him: and if Saturn be in the ninth, and exalted in the tenth, so that he be not
in his own House, do not go: for thou will meet with many obstacles, and War.
And if an evil Planet be in the ninth, or with the Lord of the ninth, and the
Lord of the ninth in his fall, he shall suffer great damage in the way: for if
he goes by water, he shall suffer shipwreck; and if by Land, he shall have
misfortunes, be taken, or die. If Saturn be in the ninth, or with his Lord, go
securely. And if a good Planet be in the ninth, or with the Lord of the ninth,
the way is good and secure. And if Mars be in the ninth, thou may not go: for
thou will meet with mortal enemies in the way. And if the Lord of the ninth be
with an evil Planet, or the Sun, it signifies ill: but he shall not be taken.
And if the Lord of the ninth have a good Planet near him, he shall escape: but
if evil, he shall be taken. If Venus be in the ninth, or with the Lord of the
ninth, the way will be good, because he shall have comfort from women. And if
Mercury be in the ninth, and the Lord of the ninth with good Planets, the way
will be very good: and if he be with evil Planets, it will be evil. And the
same is said of the Moon, as of Mercury. If the Dragons Tail be in the ninth,
he will meet with thieves, or some evil people. And if the Dragons Head be in
the ninth, the way will be good, because he shall be accompanied with
Noblemen. And in this manner may you judge in the third House concerning short
journeys.

If you would know when the journey shall be accomplished, see the Lord of the
ninth, and according to his fortitude or debility judge, because according to
the place wherein he is, is signified years, months, or days: and so you shall
judge concerning his stay, about what time he will come, by turning the years
of the Lord of the ninth into days; because so many days he shall tarry, as
the Planet signifies in the place where he is. Or otherwise: weak Angles
signify a speedy journey, mean Angles a mean journey; and the Lord of the
ninth likewise, according to the place wherein he is found.

And this I say concerning his return.

If you would know whether he shall return from his journey with an imperfect
voyage or not, see if the Moon be joined with the Lord of the first, the third,
or the ninth, and the Planet thereof be in his fall; because if it be so, he
shall return with an imperfect voyage. And if the Moon be in her exaltation,
the journey shall speedily be effected. And if there be two strong Planets, and
one Cadent, the journey shall be made; and if one be strong, and another in his
fall, he shall retire back.

Questions of the tenth House.
IF thou would know whether thou shall have any honor or benefit from a
King, Bishop, or Lord, or not, look unto the first House, and the ninth, and
their Lords: and if the Lord of the first be in the ninth, or with the Lord of
the ninth, or with any other good Planet; or if the Lord of the ninth be in the
first, or with the Lord of the first, or with any other good Planet, as Venus,
Jupiter, or the Dragon Head; or if any of them be the Lord of the ninth, or * R
* of the first, he shall receive honor and benefits from them.

And if you would know whether he shall have it in his own Country, or in a
foreign Country, look if the Lord of the ninth be in Angles, then it shall be
in his own Country: and if in succedents, it shall be near; but if in cadent
Houses, very far off.

Questions of the eleventh House.
IF you would know when it is good to set forth a Ship to Sea, see the
Ascendent; which if it be stable, the Ship will be ponderous; but if the Lord
thereof be with a good Planet, she will sustain a great weight. And if the
Ascendent be instable, and with a good Planet, the Ship will be swift, and
carry a good burden. And meanly, if the Ascendent be mean. And after this manner
may you judge concerning a Horse if a Question be thereof.

And if any unstable Sign be ascending, and his Lord be in his exaltation, or
otherwise fortunate, and the Moon behold him with a lowering Aspect, or Sextile;
let the Ship be applied to the water, because she will be very swift. And if
any evil be imposed upon her, or that she be like to be drawn into it; then set
her out when a stable Sign is ascending, or when the Moon is in the third,
fifth, eighth, ninth, or tenth house or mansion.

If you would know what wind she shall have, behold the Ascendent and his
Lord, whether he be with good or evil Planets, and in what place, and
accordingly judge.

And if you would have a strong wind spread forth your Sails at the rising of
Aquary: if a small wind, spread your Canvas when Libra is ascending: If a
moderate wind, then direct your Sails under Gemini.

Questions of the twelfth House.
FOr Imprisonment, consider the twelfth and the first; and if the Lord of the
twelfth be in the first, or with the Lord of the first, etc.

In all things, ask counsel of the Lord; and do not thou think, speak, or do
any thing, wherein God is not thy counselor. Proverbs 11. He that walks
fraudulently, reveals secrets: but he that is of a faithful spirit,
concealeth the matter.


ARBATEL of MAGIC: OR, The spiritual Wisdom of the Ancients, as well Wisemen
of the people of God, as MAGI of the Gentiles: for the illustration of the
glory of God, and his love to Mankind.
Now first of all produced out of darkness into the light, against all
caco-Magicians, and contemners of the gifts of God; for the profit and
delectation of all those, who do truly and piously love the creatures of God,
and do use them with thanksgiving, to the honor of God, and profit of
themselves and their neighbors.

Containing nine Tomes, and seven Septenaries of APHORISMS.
The first is called Isagoge, or, A Book of the Institutions of Magic: or,
(...), which in forty and nine Aphorisms comprehends the most general
Precepts of the whole Art: The second is Microcosmical Magic, what Microcosmus
has effected Magically, by his Spirit and Genius addicted to him from his
Nativity, that is, spiritual wisdom: and how the same is effected. The third is
Olympic Magic, in what manner a man may do and suffer by the spirits of
Olympus. The fourth is Hesiodiacal, and Homerical Magic, which teaches the
operations by the Spirits called Cacodaemones, as it were not adversaries to
mankind. The fifth is Roman or Sibylline Magic, which acts and operates
with Tutelar Spirits and Lords, to whom the whole Orb of the earth is
distributed. This is valde insignis Magia. To this also is the doctrine of the
Druids referred. The sixth is Pythagorical Magic, which only acts with
Spirits to whom is given the doctrine of Arts, as Physic, Medicines,
Mathematics, Alchymie, and such kind of Arts. The seventh is the Magic of
Apollonius, and the like, and agrees with the Roman and Microcosmical Magic:
only it has this thing peculiar, that it has power over the hostile spirits
of mankind. The eighth is Hermetical, that is, Aegyptiacal Magic; and
differs not much from Divine Magic. The ninth is that wisdom which depends
solely upon the Word of God; and this is called Prophetical Magic.


The first Tome of the Book of Arbatel of Magic, CALLED ISAGOGE.
IN the Name of the Creator of all things both visible and invisible, who
reveals his Mysteries out of his Treasures to them that call upon him; and
fatherly and mercifully bestows those his Secrets upon us without measure.
May he grant unto us, through his only begotten Son Jesus Christ our Lord, his
ministering spirits, the revealers of his secrets, that we may write this Book
of Arbatel, concerning the greatest Secrets which are lawful for man to know,
and to use them without offense unto God. Amen.

The first Septenary of Aphorisms.
The first Aphorism.
Whosoever would know Secrets, let him know how to keep secret things secretly;
and to reveal those things that are to be revealed and to seal those things
which are to be sealed: and not to give holy things to dogs, nor cast pearls
before swine. Observe this Law, and the eyes of thy Understanding shall be
opened, to understand secret things; and thou shall have whatsoever thy mind
desires to be divinely revealed unto thee. Thou shall have also the Angels and
Spirits of God prompt and ready in their nature to minister unto thee, as much
as any humane mind can desire.

Aphor. 2.
In all things, call upon the Name of the Lord: and without prayer unto God
through his only begotten Son, do not thou undertake to do or think any thing.
And use the Spirits given and attributed unto thee, as Ministers, without
rashness and presumption, as the messengers of God; having a due reverence
toward the Lord of Spirits. And the remainder of thy life do thou accomplish,
demeaning thy self peaceably, to the honor of God, and the profit of thy self
and thy neighbor.

Aphor. 3.
Live to thy self, and the Muses: avoid the friendship of the Multitude: be
thou covetous of time, beneficial to all men. Use thy Gifts, be vigilant in thy
Calling; and let the Word of God never depart from thy mouth.

Aphor. 4.
Be obedient to good Admonitions: avoid all procrastination: accustom thy self
to Constancy and Gravity, both in thy words and deeds. Resist the temptations
of the Tempter, by the Word of God. Flee from earthly things; seek after
heavenly things. Put no confidence in thy own wisdom; but look unto God in all
things, according to that sentence of the Scripture: When we know not what we
shall do, unto thee, O God, do we lift up our eyes, and from thee we expect our
help. For where all humane refuges do forsake us, there will the help of God
shine forth, according to the saying of Philo.

Aphor. 5.
Thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy stength,
and thy neighbor as thy self: And the Lord will keep thee as the apple of his
eye, and will deliver thee from all evil, and will replenish thee with all
good; and nothing shall thy soul desire, but thou shall be fully endued
therewith, so that it be contingent to the salvation of thy soul and body.

Aphor. 6.
Whatsoever thou have learned, frequently repeat, and six the same in thy
mind: and learn much, but not many things, because a humane understanding
cannot be alike capable in all things, unless it be such a one that is divinely
regenerated; unto him nothing is so difficult or manifold, which he may not be
able equally to attain to.

Aphor. 7.
Call upon me in the day of trouble, and I will hear thee, and thou shall
glorify me, says the Lord. For all Ignorance is tribulation of the mind;
therefore call upon the Lord in thy ignorance, and he will hear thee. And
remember that thou give honor unto God, and say with the Psalmist, Not unto
us, Lord, not unto us, but unto thy Name give the glory.

The second Septenary.
Aphor. 8.
Even as the Scripture testifies, that God appoints names to things or
persons, and also with them has distributed certain powers and offices out of
his treasures: so the Characters and Names of Stars have not any power by
reason of their figure or pronunciation, but by reason of the virtue or office
which God has ordained by nature either to such a Name or Character. For there
is no power either in heaven or in earth, or hell, which does not descend from
God; and without his permission, they can neither give or draw forth into any
action, any thing they have.

Aphor. 9.
That is the chiefest wisdom, which is from God; and next, that which is in
spiritual creatures; afterward, in corporal creatures; fourthly, in Nature,
and natural things. The Spirits that are apostate, and reserved to the last
judgment, do follow these, after a long interval. Sixthly, the ministers of
punishments in hell, and the obedient unto God. Seventhly, the Pigmies do not
possess the lowest place, and they who inhabit in elements, and elementary
things. It is convenient therefore to know and discern all differences of the
wisdom of the Creator and the Creatures, that it may be certainly manifest unto
us, what we ought to assume to our use of every thing, and that we may know in
truth how and in what manner that may be done. For truly every creature is
ordained for some profitable end to humane nature, and for the service thereof;
as the holy Scriptures, Reason, and Experience, do testify.

Aphor. 10.
God the Father Almighty, Creator of heaven and earth, and of all things
visible and invisible, in the holy Scriptures proposes himself to have an eye
over us; and as a tender father which loves his children, he teaches us what
is profitable, and what not; what we are to avoid, and what we are to embrace:
then he allureth us to obedience with great promises of corporal and eternal
benefits, and deterreth us (with threatening of punishments) from those things
which are not profitable for us. Turn over therefore with thy hand, both night
and day, those holy Writings, that thou may be happy in things present, and
blessed to all eternity. Do this, and thou shall live, which the holy Books
have taught thee.

Aphor. 11.
A number of Four is Pythagorical, and the first Quadrate; therefore here let
us place the foundation of all wisdom, after the wisdom of God revealed in the
holy Scriptures, and to the Considerations proposed in Nature.

Appoint therefore to him who solely depends upon God, the wisdom of every
creature to serve and obey him, nolens volens, willing or unwilling. And in
this, the Omnipotency of God shines forth. It consists therefore in this,
that we will discern the creatures which serve us, from those that are
unwilling; and that we may learn how to accommodate the wisdom and offices of
every creature unto our selves. This Art is not delivered, but divinely. Unto
whom God will, he reveals his secrets; but to whom he will not bestow any
thing out of his treasuries, that person shall attain to nothing without the
will of God.

Therefore we ought truly to desire (...) from God alone, which will mercifully
impart these things unto us. For he who has given us his Son, and commanded us
to pray for his holy Spirit, How much more will he subject unto us the whole
creature, and things visible and invisible? Whatsoever ye ask, ye shall
receive. Beware that ye do not abuse the gifts of God, and all things shall
work together unto you for your salvation. And before all things, be watchful
in this, That your names be written in Heaven: this is more light, That the
spirits be obedient unto you, as Christ admonishes.

Aphor. 12.
In the Acts of the Apostles, the Spirit says unto Peter after the Vision, Go
down, and doubt not but I have sent them, when he was sent for from Cornelius
the Centurion. After this manner, in vocal words, are all disciplines
delivered, by the holy Angels of God, as it appears out of the Monuments of
the Egyptians. And these things afterward were vitiated and corrupted with
humane opinions; and by the instigation of evil spirits, who sow tares amongst
the children of disobedience, as it is manifest out of St. Paul, and Hermes
Trismegistus. There is no other manner of restoring these Arts, then by the
doctrine of the holy Spirits of God; because true faith comes by hearing. But
because thou may be certain of the truth, and may not doubt whether the
spirits that speak with thee, do declare things true or false, let it only
depend upon thy faith in God; that thou may say with Paul, I know on whom I
trust. If no sparrow can fall to the ground without the will of the Father
which is in heaven, How much more will not God suffer thee to be deceived, O
thou of little faith, if thou dependest wholly upon God, and adherest only to
him?

Aphor. 13.
The Lord lives; and all things which live, do live in him. And he is truly
(...), who has given unto all things, that they be that which they are: and by
his word alone, through his Son, has produced all things out of nothing, which
are in being. He calls all the stars, and all the host of heaven by their
names. He therefore knows the true strength and nature of things, the order
and policy of every creature visible and invisible, to whom God has revealed
the names of his creatures. It remains also, that he receive power from God,
to extract the virtues in nature, and hidden secrets of the creature; and to
produce their power into action, out of darkness into light. Thy scope
therefore ought to be, that thou have the names of the Spirits, that is, their
powers and offices, and how they are subjected and appointed by God to minister
unto thee; even as Raphael was sent to Tobias, that he should heal his father,
and deliver his son from dangers, and bring him to a wife. So Michael, the
fortitude of God, governs the people of God: Gabriel, the messenger of God,
was sent to Daniel, Mary, and Zachary the father of John Baptist. And he shall
be given to thee that desire him, who will teach thee whatsoever thy soul
shall desire, in the nature of things. His ministry thou shall use with
trembling and fear of thy Creator, Redeemer, and Sanctifier, that is to say,
the Father, Son, and holy Ghost: and do not thou let slip any occasion of
learning, and be vigilant in thy calling, and thou shall want nothing that is
necessary for thee.

Aphor. 14.
Thy soul lives for ever, through him that has created thee: call therefore
upon the Lord thy God, and him only shall thou serve. This thou shall do, if
thou will perform that end for which thou art ordained of God, and what thou
owe to God and to thy neighbor. God requires of thee a mind, that thou
should honor his Son, and keep the words of his Son in thy heart: if thou
honor him, thou have done the will of thy Father which is in heaven. To thy
neighbor thou owe offices of humanity, and that thou draw all men that come
to thee, to honor the Son. This is the Law and the Prophets. In temporal
things, thou ought to call upon God as a father, that he would give unto
thee all necessaries of this life: and thou ought to help thy neighbor with
the gifts which God bestows upon thee, whether they be spiritual or corporal.

Therefore thou shall pray thus:
O Lord of Heaven and Earth, Creator and Maker of all things visible and
invisible; I, though unworthy, by thy assistance call upon thee, through thy
only begotten Son Jesus Christ our Lord, that thou will give unto me thy holy
Spirit, to direct me in thy truth unto all good. Amen.

Because I earnestly desire perfectly to know the Arts of this life, and such
things as are necessary for us, which are so overwhelmed in darkness, and
polluted with infinite humane opinions, that I of my own power can attain to no
knowledge in them, unless thou teach it me: Grant me therefore one of thy
spirits, who may teach me those things which thou would have me to know and
learn, to thy praise and glory, and the profit of our neighbor. Give me also
an apt and teachable heart, that I may easily understand those things which
thou shall teach me, and may hide them in my understanding, that I may bring
them forth at out of thy inexhaustible treasures, to all necessary uses. And
give me grace, that I may use such thy gifts humbly, with fear and trembling,
through our Lord Jesus Christ, with thy holy Spirit. Amen.

The third Septenary.
Aphor. 15.
They are called Olympic spirits, which do inhabit in the firmament, and in
the stars of the firmament: and the office of these spirits is to declare
Destinies, and to administer fatal Charms, so far forth as God pleases to
permit them: for nothing, neither evil spirit nor evil Destiny, shall be able
to hurt him who has the most High for his refuge. If therefore any of the
Olympic spirits shall teach or declare that which his star to which he is
appointed portendeth, nevertheless he can bring forth nothing into action,
unless he be permitted by the Divine power. It is God alone who gives them
power to effect it. Unto God the maker of all things, are obedient all things
celestial, sublunary, and infernal. Therefore rest in this: Let God be thy
guide in all things which thou undertakest, and all things shall attain to a
happy and desired end; even as the history of the whole world testifies, and
daily experience shows. There is peace to the godly: there is no peace to the
wicked, says the Lord.

Aphor. 16.
There are seven different governments of the Spirits of Olympus, by whom God
has appointed the whole frame and universe of this world to be governed: and
their visible stars are ARATRON, BETHOR, PHALEG, OCH, HAGITH, OPHIEL, PHUL,
after the Olympic speech. Every one of these has under him a mighty Militia
in the firmament.

ARATRON rules visible Provinces XLIX. BETHOR, XXXII. PHALEG, XXXV. OCH,
XXVIII. HAGITH, XXI. OPHIEL, XIIII. PHUL, VII.
So that there are 186 Olympic Provinces in the whole Universe, wherein the
seven Governors do exercise their power: all which are elegantly set forth in
Astronomy. But in this place it is to be explained, in what manner these
Princes and Powers may be drawn into communication. Aratron appears in the
first hour of Saturday, and very truly gives answers concerning his Provinces
and Provincials. So likewise do the rest appear in order in their days and
hours. Also every one of them rules 490 years. The beginning of their simple
Anomaly, in the 60 year before the Nativity of Christ, was the beginning of the
administration of Bethor; and it lasted until the year of our Lord Christ 430.
To whom succeeded Phaleg, until the 920 year. Then began Ocb, and continued
until the year 1410. and thenceforth Hagith rules until the year 1900.

Aphor. 17.
Magically the Princes of the seven Governors are called simply, in that time,
day, and hour wherein they rule visibly or invisibly, by their Names and
Offices which God has given unto them; and by proposing their Character which
they have given or confirmed.

The Governor Aratron has in his power those things which he does naturally,
that is, after the same manner and subject as those things which in Astronomy
are ascribed to the power of Saturn.

Those things which he does of his own free will, are, 1. That he can convert
any thing into a stone in a moment, either animal or plant, retaining the same
object to the sight. 2. He converteth treasures into coals, and coals into
treasure. 3. He gives familiars with a definite power. 4. He teaches Alchymy,
Magic, and Physic. 5. He reconcileth the subterranean spirits to men; makes
hairy men. 6. He causes one to be invisible. 7. The barren he makes fruitful,
and gives long life.


His character.


He has under him 49 Kings, 42 Princes, 35 Presidents, 28 Dukes, 21 Ministers,
standing before him; 14 familiars, seven messengers: he commands 36000
legions of spirits; the number of a legion is 490.

Bether governs those things which are ascribed to Jupiter: he soon comes
being called. He that is dignified with his character, he raises to very great
dignities, to cast open treasures: he reconcileth the spirits of the Air, that
they give true answers: they transport precious stones from place to place, and
they make medicines to work miraculously in their effects: he gives also the
familiars of the firmament, and prolongeth life to 700 years if God will.

His character.


He has under him 42 Kings, 35 Princes, 28 Dukes, 21 Counselors, 14
Ministers, 7 Messengers, 29000 legions of Spirits.

Phalec rules those things which are attributed to Mars, the Prince of peace.
He that has his character, he raises to great honors in warlike affairs.

His character.


Och governs solar things; he gives 600 years, with perfect health; he
bestows great wisdom, gives the most excellent Spirits, teaches perfect
Medicines: he converteth all things into most pure gold and precious stones: he
gives gold, and a purse springing with gold. He that is dignified with his
Character, he makes him to be worshipped as a Deity, by the Kings of the whole
world.

The Character.


He has under him 36536 Legions: he administreth all things alone: and all his
spirits serve him by centuries.

Hagith governs Venereous things. He that is dignified with his Character, he
makes very fair, and to be adorned with all beauty. He converteth copper into
gold, in a moment, and gold into copper: he gives Spirits which do faithfully
serve those to whom they are addicted.

His Character.


He has 4000 Legions of Spirits, and over every thousand he ordains Kings
for their appointed seasons.

Ophiel is the governor of such things as are attributed to Mercury: his
Character is this.



His Spirits are 100000 Legions: he easily gives familiar Spirits: he teaches
all Arts: and he that is dignified with his Character, he makes him to be able
in a moment to convert Quicksilver into the Philosophers stone.

Phul bath this character.


He changes all metals into silver, in word and deed; governs Lunary things;
heals the dropsy: he gives spirits of the water, who do serve men in a
corporeal and visible form; and makes men to live 300 years.

The most general Precepts of this Secret.
1. Every Governor acts with all his Spirits, either naturally, to wit,
always after the same manner; or otherwise of their own free will, if God
hinder them not.

2. Every Governor is able to do all things which are done naturally in a long
time, out of matter before prepared; and also to do them suddenly, out of
matter not before prepared. As Och, the Prince of Solar things, prepares gold
in the mountains in a long time; in a less time, by the Chemical Art; and
Magically, in a moment.

3. The true and divine Magician may use all the creatures of God, and offices
of the Governors of the world, at his own will, for that the Governors of the
world are obedient unto them, and come when they are called, and do execute
their commands: but God is the Author thereof: as Joshua caused the Sun to
stand still in heaven.

They send some of their Spirits to the mean Magicians, which do obey them only
in some determinate business: but they hear not the false Magicians, but expose
them to the deceits of the devils, and cast them into diverse dangers, by the
command of God; as the Prophet Jeremiah testifies, in his eighth Chapter,
concerning the Jews.

4. In all the elements there are the seven Governors with their hosts, who do
move with the equal motion of the firmament; and the inferiors do always
depend upon the superiors, as it is taught in Philosophy.

5. A man that is a true Magician, is brought forth a Magician from his mothers
womb: others, who do give themselves to this office, are unhappy. This is that
which John the Baptist speaks of: No man can do any thing of himself, except
it be given him from above.

6. Every Character given from a Spirit, for what cause soever, has his
efficacy in this business, for which it is given, in the time prefixed: But it
is to be used the same day and Planetary hour wherein it is given.

7. God lives, and thy soul lives: keep thy Covenant, and thou have
whatsoever the Spirit shall reveal unto thee in God, because all things shall
be done which the Spirit promises unto thee.

Aphor. 18.
There are other names of the Olympic spirits delivered by others; but they
only are effectual, which are delivered to any one, by the Spirit the revealer,
visible or invisible: and they are delivered to every one as they are
predestined: therefore they are called Constellations; and they seldom have
any efficacy above 40 years. Therefore it is most safe for the young practisers
of Art, that they work by the offices of the Spirits alone, without their
names; and if they are pre-ordained to attain the Art of Magic, the other
parts of the Art will offer themselves unto them of their own accord. Pray
therefore for a constant faith, and God will bring to pass all things in due
season.

Aphor. 19.
Olympus and the inhabitants thereof, do of their own accord offer themselves
to men in the forms of Spirits; and are ready to perform their Offices for
them, whether they will or not: by how much the rather will they attend you, if
they are desired? But there do appear also evil Spirits, and destroyers, which
is caused by the envy and malice of the devil; and because men do allure and
draw them unto themselves with their sins, as a punishment due to sinners.
Whosoever therefore desires familiarly to have a conversation with Spirits,
let him keep himself from all enormious sins, and diligently pray to the most
High to be his keeper; and he shall break through all the snares and
impediments of the devil: and let him apply himself to the service of God, and
he will give him an increase in wisdom.

Aphor. 20.
All things are possible to them that believe them, and are willing to receive
them; but to the incredulous and unwilling, all things are unpossible: there is
no greater hinderance then a wavering mind, levity, unconstancy, foolish
babbling, drunkenness, lusts, and disobedience to the word of God. A Magician
therefore ought to be a man that is godly, honest, constant in his words and
deeds, having a firm faith toward God, prudent, and covetous of nothing but of
wisdom about divine things.

Aphor. 21.
When you would call any of the Olympic Spirits, observe the rising of the Sun
that day, and of what nature the Spirit is which you desire; and saying the
prayer following, your desires shall be perfected.

Omnipotent and eternal God, who have ordained the whole creation for thy
praise and glory, and for the salvation of man, I beseech thee that thou
would send thy Spirit N. N. of the solar order, who shall inform and teach me
those things which I shall ask of him; or, that he may bring me medicine
against the dropsy, etc. Nevertheless not my will be done, but thine, through
Jesus Christ thy only begotten Son, our Lord, Amen.

But thou shall not detain the Spirit above a full hour, unless he be
familiarly addicted unto thee.

Forasmuch as thou came in peace, and quietly, and have answered unto my
petitions; I give thanks unto God, in whose Name thou came: and now thou
may depart in peace unto thy orders; and return to me again when I shall call
thee by thy name, or by thy order, or by thy office, which is granted from the
Creator, Amen.

Ecclesiast. Chap. 5. Be not rash with thy mouth, neither let thy heart be
hasty to utter any thing before God; for God is in Heaven, and thou in earth:
Therefore let thy words be few; for a dream comes through the multitude of
business.

The third Septenary.
Aphor. 22.
We call that a secret, which no man can attain unto by humane industry without
revelation; which Science lies obscured, hidden by God in the creature; which
nevertheless he does permit to be revealed by Spirits, to a due use of the
thing it self. And these secrets are either concerning things divine, natural
or humane. But thou may examine a few, and the most select, which thou will
commend with many more.

Aphor. 23.
Make the beginning of the nature of the secret, either by a Spirit in the form
of a person, or by virtues separate, either in humane Organs, or by what manner
soever the same may be effected; and this being known, require of a Spirit
which knows that art, that he would briefly declare unto thee whatsoever that
secret is: and pray unto God, that he would inspire thee with his grace,
whereby thou may bring the secret to the end thou desire, for the praise
and glory of God, and the profit of thy neighbor.

Aphor. 24. The greatest secrets are in number seven.
1. The first is the curing of all diseases in the space of seven days, either
by characters, or by natural things, or by the superior Spirits with the divine
assistance.

2. The second is, to be able to prolong life to whatsoever age we please: I
say, a corporal and natural life.

3. The third is, to have the obedience of the creatures in the elements which
are in the forms of personal Spirits; also of Pigmies, Spirits of the four
elements. Paracelsus.
Sagani, Nymphs, Dryades, and Spirits of the Woods.

4. The fourth is, to be able to discourse with knowledge and understanding of
all things visible and invisible, and to understand the power of everything,
and to what it belongs.

5. The fifth is, that a man be able to govern himself according to that end
for which God has appointed him.

6. The sixth is, to know God, and Christ, and his holy Spirit: this is the
perfection of the Microcosmus.

7. The seventh, to be regenerate, as Henochius the King of the inferior world.

These seven secrets a man of an honest and constant mind may learn of the
Spirits, without any offense unto God.

The mean Secrets are likewise seven in number.
1. The first is, transmutation of Metals, which is vulgarly called Alchymy;
which certainly is given to very few, and not but of special grace.

2. The second is, the curing of diseases with Metals, either by the magnetic
virtues of precious stones, or by the use of the Philosophers stone, and the
like.

3. The third is, to be able to perform Astronomical and Mathematical miracles,
such as are Hydraulick-engines, to administer business by the influence of
Heaven, and things which are of like sort.

4. The fourth is, to perform the works of natural Magic, of what sort soever
they be.

5. The fifth is, to know all Physical secrets.

6. The sixth is, to know the foundation of all Arts which are exercised with
the hands and offices of the body.

7. The seventh is, to know the foundation of all Arts which are exercised by
the angelical nature of man.

The lesser secrets are seven.
1. The first is, to do a thing diligently, and to gather together much money.

2. The second is, to ascend from a mean state to dignities and honors, and to
establish a newer family, which may be illustrious and do great things.

3. The third is, to excel in military affairs, and happily to atchieve to
great things, and to be an head of the head of Kings and Princes.

4. To be a good housekeeper both in the Country and City.

5. The fifth is, to be an industrious and fortunate Merchant.

6. To be a Philosopher, Mathematician, and Physician, according to Aristotle,
Plato, Ptolomy, Euclides, Hippocrates and Galen.

7. To be a Divine according to the Bible and Schools. which all writers of
divinity both old and new have taught.

Aphor. 25.
We have already declared what a secret is, the kinds and species thereof: it
remains now to show how we may attain to know those things which we desire.

The true and only way to all secrets, is to have recourse unto God the Author
of all good; and as Christ teaches,

In the first place seek ye the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all
these things shall be added unto you.

2 Also see that your hearts be not burdened with surfeting and drunkenness,
and the cares of this life.

3. Also commit your cares unto the Lord, and he will do it.

4. Also I the Lord thy God do teach thee, what things are profitable for thee,
and do guide thee in the way wherein thou walk.

5. And I will give thee understanding, and will teach thee in the way wherein
thou shall go, and I will guide thee with my eye.

6. Also if you which are evil, know how to give good things to your children,
how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give his holy Spirit to them
that ask him?

If you will do the will of my Father which is in heaven, ye are truly my
disciples, and we will come unto you, and make our abode with you.

If you draw these seven places of Scripture from the letter unto the Spirit,
or into action, thou can not err, but shall attain to the desired bound;
thou shall not err from the mark, and God himself by his holy Spirit will
teach thee true and profitable things: he will give also his ministering Angels
unto thee, to be thy companions, helpers and teachers of all the secrets of the
world, and he will command every creature to be obedient unto thee, so that
cheerfully rejoicing thou may say with the Apostles, That the Spirits are
obedient unto thee; so that at length thou shall be certain of the greatest
thing of all, That thy name is written in Heaven.

Aphor. 26.
There is another way which is more common, that secrets may be revealed unto
thee also, when thou art unwitting thereof; either by God, or by Spirits which
have secrets in their power; or by dreams, or by strong imaginations and
impressions, or by the constellation of a nativity by celestial knowledge.
After this manner are made heroic men, such as there are very many, and all
learned men in the world, Plato, Aristotle, Hippocrates, Galen, Euclide,
Archimedes, Hermes Trismegistus the father of secrets, with Theophrastus
Paracelsus; all which men had in themselves all the virtues of secrets.
Hitherto also are referred, Homer, Hesiod, Orpheus, Pythagoras; but these had
not such gifts of secrets as the former. To this are referred, the Nymphs, and
sons of Melusina, and Gods of the Gentiles, Achilles, Aeneas, Hercules: also
Cyrus, Alexander the great, Julius Caesar, Lucullus, Sylla, Marius

It is a Canon, That every one know his own Angel, and that he obey him
according to the Word of God: and let him beware of the snares of the evil
Angel, lest he be involved in the calamities of Brute and Marcus Antonius. To
this refer the book of Jovianus Pontanus of Fortune, and his Eutiches.

The third way is, diligent and hard labor, without which no great thing can be
obtained from the divine Deity worthy admiration, as it is said, Tu nihil
invita dices faciesve Minerva.

Nothing can thou do or say against Minerva's will.



We do detest all evil Magicians, who make themselves associates with the
devils with their unlawful superstitions, and do obtain and effect some things
which God permits to be done, instead of the punishment of the devils. So
also they do other evil acts, the devil being the author, as the Scriptures
testify of Judas. To these are referred all idolaters of old, and of our age,
and abusers of Fortune, such as the heathens are full of. And to these do
appertain all Charontick evocation of Spirits, as the work of Saul with the
woman, and Lucanus prophecy of the deceased soldier, concerning the event of
the Pharsalian war, and the like.

Aphor. 27.
Make a Circle with a center A, which is B. C. D. E. At the East let there be
B. C. a square. At the North, C. D. At the west, D. E. And at the South E. D.
Divide the several quadrants into seven parts, that there may be in the whole
28 parts: and let them be again divided into four parts, that there may be 112
parts of the Circle: and so many are the true secrets to be revealed. And this
Circle in this manner divided, is the seal of the secrets of the world, which
they draw from the only center A, that is, from the invisible God, unto the
whole creature. The Prince of the Oriental secrets is resident in the middle,
and has three Nobles on either side, every one whereof has four under him,
and the Prince himself has four appertaining unto him. And in this manner the
other princes and nobles have their quadrants of secrets, with their four
secrets. But the Oriental secret is the study of all wisdom; The West of
strength; The South, of tillage; The North, of more rigid life: So that the
Eastern secrets are commended to be the best; the Meridian to be mean; and the
East and North to be lesser. The use of this seal of secrets is, that thereby
thou may know whence the Spirits or Angels are produced, which may teach the
secrets delivered unto them from God. But they have names taken from their
offices and powers according to the gift which God has severally distributed
to every one of them. One has the power of the sword; another, of the
pestilence; and another, of inflicting famine upon the people as it is ordained
by God. Some are destroyers of Cities, as those two were, who were sent to
overthrow Sodom and Gomorrha and the places adjacent, examples whereof the holy
Scripture witnesses. Some are the watchmen over Kingdoms; others, the keepers
of private persons; and from thence, any one may easily form their names in his
own language: so that he which will, may ask a physical Angel, mathematical, or
philosophical, or an Angel of civil wisdom, or of supernatural or natural
wisdom, or for any thing whatsoever; and let him ask seriously, with a great
desire of his mind, and with faith and constancy; and without doubt, that which
he asks he shall receive from the Father and God of all Spirits. This faith
surmounteth all seals, and brings them into subjection to the will of man.
The Characteristical manner of calling Angels succeeds this faith, which
depends only on divine revelation; But without the said faith preceding it,
it lies in obscurity. Nevertheless, if any one will use them for a memorial,
and no otherwise, and as a thing simply created by God to this purpose, to
which such a spiritual power or essence is bound; he may use them without any
offense unto God. But let him beware, lest that he fall into idolatry, and the
snares of the devil, who with his cunning sorceries, easily deceives the
unwary. And he is not taken but only by the singer of God, and is appointed to
the service of man; so that they unwillingly serve the godly; but not without
temptations and tribulations, because the commandment has it, That he shall
bruise the heel of Christ, the seed of the woman. We are therefore to exercise
our selves about spiritual things, with fear and trembling, and with great
reverence toward God, and to be conversant in spiritual essences with gravity
and justice. And he which medleth with such things, let him beware of all
levity, pride, covetousness, vanity, envy and ungodliness, unless he will
miserably perish.

Aphor. 21.
Because all good is from God, who is only good, those things which we would
obtain of him, we ought to seek them by prayer in Spirit and Truth, and a
simple heart. The conclusion of the secret of secrets is, That every one
exercise himself in prayer, for those things which he desires, and he shall not
suffer a repulse. Let not any one despise prayer; for by whom God is prayed
unto, to him he both can and will give. Now let us acknowledge him the Author,
from whom let us humbly seek for our desires. A merciful and good Father,
loves the sons of desires, as Daniel; and sooner hears us, then we are able
to overcome the hardness of our hearts to pray. But he will not that we give
holy things to dogs, nor despise and contemn the gifts of his treasury.
Therefore diligently and often read over and over the first Septenary of
secrets, and guide and direct thy life and all thy thoughts according to those
precepts; and all things shall yield to the desires of thy mind in the Lord,
to whom thou trustest.

The fifth Septenary.
Aphor. 29.
As our study of Magic proceeds in order from general Rules premised, let us
now come to a particular explication thereof. Spirits either are divine
ministers of the word, and of the Church, and the members thereof; or else they
are servient to the Creatures in corporal things, partly for the salvation of
the soul and body, and partly for its destruction. And there is nothing done,
whether good or evil without a certain and determinate order and government. He
that seeks after a good end, let him follow it; and he that desires an evil
end, pursue that also, and that earnestly, from divine punishment, and turning
away from the divine will. Therefore let every one compare his ends with the
word of God, and as a touchstone that will judge between good and evil; and let
him propose unto himself what is to be avoided, and what is to be sought after;
and that which he constituteth and determines to himself, let him follow
diligently, not procrastinating or delaying, until he attain to his appointed
bound.

Aphor. 30.
They which desire riches, glory of this world, Magistracy, honors, dignities,
tyrannies, (and that magically) if they endeavor diligently after them, they
shall obtain them, every one according to his destiny, industry, and magical
Sciences, as the History of Melesina witnesses, and the Magicians thereof, who
ordained, That none of the Italian nation should for ever obtain the Rule or
Kingdom of Naples; and brought it to pass, that he who reigned in his age, to
be thrown down from his seat: so great is the power of the guardian or tutelar
Angels of the Kingdoms of the world.

Aphor. 31.
Call the Prince of the Kingdom, and lay a command upon him, and command what
thou will, and it shall be done, if that Prince be not again absolved from his
obedience by a succeeding Magician. Therefore the Kingdom of Naples may be
again restored to the Italians, if any Magician shall call him who instituted
this order, and compel him to recall his deed; he may be compelled also, to
restore the secret power taken from the treasury of Magic; A Book, a Gemme,
and magical Horn. which being had, any one may easily, if he will, make himself
the Monarch of the world. But Judaeus chused rather to live among Gods, until
the judgment, before the transitory good of this world; and his heart is so
blind, that he understands nothing of the God of heaven and earth, or
thinks more, but enjoys the delights of things immortal, to his own eternal
destruction. And he may be easier called up, then the Angel of Plotinus in the
Temple of Isis.

Aphor. 32.
In like manner also, the Romans were taught by the Sibyls books; and by that
means made themselves the Lords of the world, as Histories witness. But the
Lords of the Prince of a Kingdom do bestow the lesser Magistracies. He
therefore that desires to have a lesser office, or dignity, let him magically
call a Noble of the Prince, and his desire shall be fulfilled.

Aphor. 33.
But he who coveteth contemptible dignities, as riches alone, let him call the
Prince of riches, or one of his Lords, and he shall obtain his desire in that
kind, whereby he would grow rich, either in earthly goods, or merchandise, or
with the gifts of Princes, or by the study of metals, or Chemistry: as he
produces any president of growing rich by these means, he shall obtain his
desire therein.

Aphor. 34.
All manner of evocation is of the same kind and form, and this way was
familiar of old time to the Sibyls and chief Priests. This in our time, through
ignorance and impiety, is totally lost; and that which remains, is depraved
with infinite lies and superstitions.

Aphor. 35.
The humane understanding is the only effecter of all wonderful works, so
that it be joined to any Spirit; and being joined, she produces what she will.
Therefore we are careful to proceed in Magic, lest that Sirens and other
monsters deceive us, which likewise do desire the society of the humane soul.
Let the Magician carefully hide himself always under the wings of the most
High, lest he offer himself to be devoured of the roaring Lion: for they who
desire earthly things, do very hardly escape the snares of the devil.

The sixth Septenary.
Aphor. 36.
Care is to be taken, that experiments be not mixed with experiments; but that
every one be only simple and several: for God and Nature have ordained all
things to a certain and appointed end: so that for examples sake, they who
perform cures with the most simple herbs and roots, do cure the most happily of
all. And in this manner, in Constellations, Words and Characters, Stones, and
such like, do lie hid the greatest influences or virtues in deed, which are in
stead of a miracle.

So also are words, which being pronounced, do forthwith cause creatures both
visible and invisible to yield obedience, as well creatures of this our world,
as of the warry, aerie, subterranean, and Olympic, supercelestial and infernal,
and also the divine.

Therefore simplicity is chiefly to be studied, and the knowledge of such
simples is to be sought for from God; otherwise by no other means or
experience they can be found out.

Aphor. 37.
And let all lots have their place decently: Order, Reason and Means, are the
three things which do easily render all learning as well of the visible as
invisible creatures. This is the course of Order, That some creatures are
creatures of the light; others, of darkness: these are subject to vanity,
because they run headlong in^o darkness, and inthrall themselves in eternal
punishments for their rebellion. Their Kingdom is partly very beautiful in
transitory and corruptible things on the one part, because it cannot consist
without some virtue and great gifts of God; and partly most filthy and horrid
to be spoken of, because it abounds with all wickedness and sin, idolatry,
contempt of God, blasphemies against the true God and his works, worshipping of
devils, disobedience toward Magistrates, seditions, homicides, robberies,
tyranny, adulteries, wicked lusts, rapes, thefts, lies, perjuries, pride, and a
covetous desire of rule; in this mixture consists the kingdom of darkness:
but the creatures of the light, are filled with eternal truth, and with the
grace of God, and are Lords of the whole world, and do reign over the Lords of
darkness, as the members of Christ. Between these and the other, there is a
continual war, until God shall put an end to their strife, by his last
judgment.

Aphor. 38.
Therefore Magic is twofold in its first division; the one is of God, which he
bestows on the creatures of light; the other also is of God, but it is the
gift which he gives unto the creatures of darkness: and this is also twofold:
the one is to a good end, as when the Princes of darkness are compelled to do
good unto the creatures, God enforcing them; the other is for an evil end, when
God permits such to punish evil persons, that magically they are deceived to
destruction; or, also he commands such to be cast out into destruction.

The second division of Magic is, that it brings to pass some works with
visible instruments, through visible things; and it effects other works with
invisible instruments by invisible things; and it acts other things, as well
with mixed means, as instruments and effects.

The third division is, There are some things which are brought to pass by
invocation of God alone: this is partly Prophetical, and Philosophical, and
partly as it were Theophrastical.

Other things there are, which by reason of the ignorance of the true God, are
done with the Princes of Spirits, that his desires may be fulfilled; such is
the work of the Mercurialists.

The fourth division is, That some exercise their Magic with the good Angels
in stead of God, as it were descending down from the most high God: such was
the Magic of Baalim*

Another Magic is, that which exercises their actions with the chief of the
evil Spirits; such were they who wrought by the minor Gods of the heathens.

The fifth division is, That some do act with Spirits openly, and face to face;
which is given to few: others do work by dreams and other signs; which the
ancients took from their auguries and sacrifices.

The sixth division is, That some work by immortal creatures, others by mortal
creatures, as Nymphs, Satyrs, and such like inhabitants of other elements,
Pigmies, etc.

The seventh division is, That the Spirits do serve some of their own accord,
without art; others they will scarce attend, being called by art.

Among these species of Magic, that is the most excellent of all, which
depends upon God alone. The second, Them whom the Spirits do serve faithfully
of their own accord. The third is, that which is the property of Christians,
which depends on the power of Christ which he has in heaven and earth.

Aphor. 39. There is a sevenfold preparation to learn the Magic Art.
The first is, to meditate day and night how to attain to the true knowledge of
God, both by his word revealed from the foundation of the world; as also by the
seal of the creation, and of the creatures; and by the wonderful effects which
the visible and invisible creatures of God do show forth.

Secondly, it is requisite, that a man descend down into himself, and chiefly
study to know himself; what mortal part he has in him, and what immortal; and
what part is proper to himself, and what diverse.

Thirdly, That he learn by the immortal part of himself, to worship, love and
fear the eternal God, and to adore him in Spirit and Truth; and with his mortal
part, to do those things which he knows to be acceptable to God, and
profitable to his neighbors.

These are the three first and chiefest precepts of Magic, wherewith let every
one prepare himself that covets to obtain true Magic or divine wisdom, that
he may be accounted worthy thereof, and one to whom the Angelical creatures
willingly do service, not occultly only, but also manifestly, and as it were
face to face.

Fourthly, Whereas every man is vigilant to see to what kind of life he shall
be called from his mothers womb, that every one may know whether he be born to
Magic, and to what species thereof; which every one may perceive easily that
reads these things, and by experience may have success therein; for such
things and such gifts are not given but only to the low and humble.

In the fifth place we are to take care, that we understand when the Spirits
are assisting us, in undertaking the greatest business; and he that understands
this, it is manifest, that he shall be made a Magician of the ordination of
God; that is, such a person who uses the ministry of the Spirits to bring
excellent things to pass. Here, as for the most part, they sin either through
negligence, ignorance, or contempt, or by too much superstition; they offend
also by ingratitude toward God, whereby many famous men have afterward drawn
upon themselves destruction: they sin also by rashness and obstinacy; and also
when they do not use their gifts for that honor of God which is required, and
do prefer (...).

Sixthly, The Magician had need of faith and taciturnity, especially, that he
disclose no secret which the Spirit has forbid him, as he commanded Daniel to
seal some things, that is, not to declare them in public; so as it was not
lawful for Paul to speak openly of all things which he saw in a vision. No man
will believe how much is contained in this one precept.

Seventhly, In him that would be a Magician, there is required the greatest
justice, that he undertake nothing that is ungodly, wicked or unjust, nor to
let it once come in his mind; and so he shall be divinely defended from all
evil.

Aphor. 40.
When the Magician determines with himself to do any incorporeal thing, either
with any exterior or interior sense, then let him govern himself according to
these seven subsequent laws, to accomplish his Magical end.

The first Law is this, That he know that such a Spirit is ordained unto him
from God; and let him meditate that God is the beholder of all his thoughts and
actions; therefore let him direct all the course of his life according to the
rule prescribed in the word of God.

Secondly, Always pray with David, Take not thy holy Spirit from me; and
strengthen me with thy free Spirit; and lead us not into temptation, but
deliver us from evil: I beseech thee, O heavenly Father, do not give power unto
any lying Spirit, as thou did over Ahab that he perished; but keep me in thy
truth. Amen.

Thirdly, Let him accustom himself to try the Spirits, as the Scripture
admonishes; for grapes cannot be gathered of thorns: let us try all things,
and hold fast that which is good and laudable, that we may avoid every thing
that is repugnant to the divine power.

The fourth is, To be remote and clear from all manner of superstition; for
this is superstition, to attribute divinity in this place to things, wherein
there is nothing at all divine; or to choose or frame to our selves, to worship
God with some kind of worship which he has not commanded: such are the
Magical ceremonies of Satan, whereby he impudently offers himself to be
worshipped as God.

The fifth thing to be eschewed, is all worship of Idols, which binds any
divine power to idols or other things of their own proper motion, where they
are not placed by the Creator, or by the order of Nature: which things many
false and wicked Magicians faign.

Sixthly, All the deceitful imitations and affections of the devil are also to
be avoided, whereby he imitateth the power of the creation and of the Creator,
that he may so produce things with a word, that they may not be what they are.
Which belongs only to the omnipotency of God, and is not communicable to the
creature.

Seventhly, Let us cleave fast to the gifts of God, and of his holy Spirit,
that we may know them, and diligently embrace them with our whole heart, and
all our strength.

Aphor. 41.
We come now to the nine last Aphorisms of this whole Tome; wherewith we will,
the divine mercy assisting us, conclude this whole Magical Isagoge.

Therefore in the first place it is to be observed, what we understand by
Magician in this work.

Him then we count to be a Magician, to whom by the grace of God, the spiritual
essences do serve to manifest the knowledge of the whole universe, and of the
secrets of Nature contained therein, whether they are visible or invisible.
This description of a Magician plainly appears, and is universal.

An evil Magician is he, whom by the divine permission the evil Spirits do
serve, to his temporal and eternal destruction and perdition, to deceive men,
and draw them away from God; such was Simon Magus, of whom mention is made in
the Acts of the Apostles, and in Clemens; whom St. Peter commanded to be thrown
down upon the earth, when as he had commanded himself, as it were a God, to be
raised up into the air by the unclean Spirits.

Unto this order are also to be referred all those who are noted in the two
Tables of the Law; and are set forth with their evil deeds.

The subdivisions and species of both kinds of Magic, we will note in the
Tomes following. In this place it shall suffice, that we distinguish the
Sciences, which is good, and which is evil: Whereas man sought to obtain them
both at first, to his own ruin and destruction, as Moses and Hermes do
demonstrate.

Aphor. 42.
Secondly, we are to know, That a Magician is a person predestined to this
work from his mothers womb; neither let him assume any such great things to
himself, unless he be called divinely by grace hereunto, for some good end; to
a bad end is, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, It must be that offenses
will come; but woe be to that man through whom they come. Therefore, as we have
before oftentimes admonished, With fear and trembling we must live in this
world.

Notwithstanding I will not deny, but that some men may with study and
diligence obtain some species of both kinds of Magic, if it may be admitted.
But he shall never aspire to the highest kinds thereof; yet if he covet to
assail them, he shall doubtless offend both in soul and body, Such are they,
who by the operations of false Magicians, are sometimes carried to Mount Horeb,
or in some wilderness, or deserts; or they are maimed in some member, or are
simply torn in pieces, or are deprived of their understanding; even as many
such things happen by the use thereof where men are forsaken by God, and
delivered to the power of Satan.

The seventh Septenary.
Aphor. 43.
The Lord lives, and the works of God do live in him by his appointment,
whereby he wills them to be; for he will have them to use their liberty in
obedience to his commands, or disobedience thereof. To the obedient, he has
proposed their rewards; to the disobedient he has propounded their deserved
punishment. Therefore these Spirits of their free will, through their pride and
contempt of the Son of God, have revolted from God their Creator, and are
reserved unto the day of wrath; and there is left in them a very great power in
the creation; but notwithstanding it is limited, and they are confined to their
bounds with the bridle of God. Therefore the Magician of God, which signifies a
wise man of God, or one informed of God, is led forth by the hand of God unto
all everlasting good, both mean things, and also the chiefest corporal things.

Great is the power of Satan, by reason of the great sins of men. Therefore
also the Magicians of Satan do perform great things, and greater then any man
would believe: although they do subsist in their own limits, nevertheless they
are above all humane apprehension, as to the corporal and transitory things of
this life; which many ancient Histories, and daily Examples do testify. Both
kinds of Magic are different one from the other in their ends: the one
leads to eternal good, and uses temporal things with thanksgiving; the other
is a little sollicitous about eternal things; but wholly exercises himself
about corporal things, that he may freely enjoy all his lusts and delights in
contempt of God and his anger.

Aphor. 44.
The passage from the common life of man unto a Magical life, is no other but a
sleep from that life, and an awaking to this life; for those things which
happen to ignorant and unwise men in their common life, the same things happen
to the willing and knowing Magician.

The Magician understands when the mind does meditate of himself; he
deliberateth, reasons, constituteth and determines what is to be done; he
observes when his cogitations do proceed from a divine separate essence, and
he proves of what order that divine separate essence is.

But the man that is ignorant of Magic, is carried to and fro, as it were in
war with his affections; he knows not when they issue out of his own mind,
or are impressed by the assisting essence; and he knows not how to overthrow
the counsels of his enemies by the word of God, or to keep himself from the
snares and deceits of the tempter.

Aphor. 45.
The greatest precept of Magic is, to know what every man ought to receive for
his use from the assisting Spirit; and what to refuse: which he may learn of
the Psalmist, saying, Wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way? in keeping
thy word, Oh Lord. To keep the word of God, so that the evil one snatch it not
out of the heart, is the chiefest precept of wisdom. It is lawful to admit of,
and exercise other suggestions which are not contrary to the glory of God, and
charity toward our neighbors, not inquiring from what Spirit such suggestions
proceed: But we ought to take heed, that we are not too much busied about
unnecessary things, according to the admonition of Christ; Martha, Martha, thou
art troubled about many things; but Mary has chosen the better part, which
shall not be taken from her. Therefore let us always have regard unto the
saying of Christ, Seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and
all these things shall be added unto you. All other things, that is, all things
which are due to the mortal Microcosme, as food, raiment, and the necessary
arts of this life.

Aphor. 46.
There is nothing so much becomes a man, as constancy in his words and deeds,
and when the like rejoices in his like; there are none more happy then such,
because the holy Angels are conversant about such, and possess the custody of
them: on the contrary, men that are unconstant are lighter then nothing, and
rotten leaves. We choose the 46 Aphorism from these. Even as every one
governs himself, so he allureth unto himself Spirits of his nature and
condition; but one very truly advises, that no man should carry himself
beyond his own calling, lest that he draw unto himself some malignant Spirit
from the uttermost parts of the earth, by whom either he shall be infatuated
and deceived, or brought to final destruction. This precept appears most
plainly: for Midas, when he would convert all things into gold, drew up such a
Spirit unto himself, which was able to perform this; and being deceived by him,
he had been brought to death by famine, if his foolishness had not been
corrected by the mercy of God. The same thing happened to a certain woman about
Fanck ford at Odera, in our times, who would scrape together and devour money of
any thing. Would that men would diligently weigh this precept, and not account
the Histories of Midas, and the like, for fables; they would be much more
diligent in moderating their thoughts and affections, neither would they be so
perpetually vexed with the Spirits of the golden mountains of Utopia. Therefore
we ought most diligently to observe, that such presumptions should be cast out
of the mind, by the word, while they are new; neither let them have any habit
in the idle mind, that is empty of the divine word.

Aphor. 47.
He that is faithfully conversant in his vocation, shall have also the Spirits
constant companions of his desires, who will successively supply him in all
things. But if he have any knowledge in Magic, they will not be unwilling to
show him, and familiarly to converse with him, and to serve him in those
several ministeries, unto which they are addicted; the good Spirits in good
things, unto salvation; the evil Spirits in every evil thing, to destruction.
Examples are not wanting in the Histories of the whole World; and do daily
happen in the world. Theodosius before the victory of Arbogastus, is an example
of the good; Brute before he was slain, was an example of the evil Spirits,
when he was persecuted of the Spirit of Caesar, and exposed to punishment, that
he slew himself, who had slain his own Father, and the Father of his Country.

Aphor. 48.
All Magic is a revelation of Spirits of that kind, of which sort the Magic
is; so that the nine Muses are called, in Hesiod, the ninth Magic, as he
manifestly testifies of himself in Theogony. In Homer, the genius of Ulysses in
Psigiogagia. Hermes, the Spirits of the more sublime parts of the mind. God
revealed himself to Moses in the bush. The three wise men who came to seek
Christ at Jerusalem, the Angel of the Lord was their leader. The Angels of the
Lord directed Daniel. Therefore there is nothing whereof any one may glory; For
it is not unto him that wills, nor unto him that runs; but to whom God
will have mercy, or of some other spiritual fate. From hence springs all
Magic, and thither again it will revolve, whether it be good or evil. In this
manner Tages the first teacher of the Magic of the Romans, gushed out of the
earth. Diana of the Ephesians showed her worship, as if it had been sent from
heaven. So also Apollo. And all the Religion of the Heathens is taken from the
same Spirits; neither are the opinions of the Sadduces, humane inventions.

Aphor. 49.
The conclusion therefore of this Isagoge is the same which we have above
already spoken of, That even as there is one God, from whence is all good; and
one sin, to wit, disobedience against the will of the commanding God, from
whence comes all evil; so that the fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom,
and the profit of all Magic; for obedience to the will of God, follows the
fear of God; and after this, do follow the presence of God and of the holy
Spirit, and the ministry of the holy Angels, and all good things out of the
inexhaustible treasures of God.

But unprofitable and damnable Magic arises from this; where we lose the fear
of God out of our hearts, and suffer sin to reign in us, there the Prince of
this world, the God of this world begins, and sets up his kingdom in
stead of holy things, in such as he finds profitable for his kingdom; there,
even as the spider takes the fly which falls into his web, so Satan
spreads abroad his nets, and takes man with the snares of covetousness,
until he sucketh him, and draws him to eternal fire: these he cherishes and
advances on high, that their fall may be the greater.

Courteous Reader, apply thy eyes and mind to the sacred and profane
Histories, and to those things which thou see daily to be done in the world,
and thou shall find all things full of Magic, according to a twofold
Science, good and evil; which that they may be the better discerned, we will
put here their division and subdivision, for the conclusion of these Isagoges;
wherein every one may contemplate, what is to be followed, and which to be
avoided, and how far it is to be labored for by every one, to a competent end
of life and living.

Sciences Good Theosophy Knowledge of the Word of God, and ruling ones life
according to the word of God. Knowledge of the government of God by Angels,
which the Scripture calls watchmen; and to understand the mystery of Angels.
Anthrosophy given to man Knowledge of natural things. Wisdom in humane things.

Evil Cacosophy Contempt of the word of God, and to live after the will of the
devil. Ignorance of the government of God by Angels. To contemn the custody of
the Angels, and that their companions are of the devil. Idolatry. Atheism.
Cacodaemony The knowledge of poisons in nature, and to use them. Wisdom in
all evil arts, to the destruction of mankind, and to use them in contempt of
God, and for the loss and destruction of men.




FINIS
