The Preface.
NOt to vy with Any, who have rendered Them better, nor to diminish those who
perhaps have done Them worse, nor for the vanity wherewith Many delight
Themselves, To be reputed Authors of a Public work, much less for any sordid
expectation of gain, does This Edition of the Psalms offer it self to the
common view. The general distaste taken at some unhandsome expressions in The
Old, which both disfigured the meaning of the Holy Ghost, and reproached our
English Tongue, (That did not afford a decent clothing to preserve Them from
the scorn of Those who apprehended any occasion to quarrel us) invited Me to
try in Some Few, whither They might not in the plainest dress of language be
freed from those disparagements of the Text, which gave offense. After I had
privately showed Those (intended no farther then for an assay) persuasion of
Friends, who had power to command, made me (having now leisure from those
greater employments, to which I was called more then I ever expected) willing
to run through the Rest.

I know Alteration (though for the Better) is scarce welcome to People by
Custom, August. Epist. 118. ad Januarium de consuetud. variis Regionum.
and long Prescription habited in their First forms, that of S. Augustine
being often true, Ipsa mutatio consuetudinis, quae adjuvat Utilitate, Novitate
perturbat, The profit does not recompense to Them the trouble and disorder of
the Change.

I have therefore by tying my self to the old Meter and old Tunes, endeavored
to prevent that disturbance which the Alteration might bring, whose difference
in this Version will not be much discerned, when the Congregation, perfect in
their ancient Tunes, may with as much ease repeat every verse read before They
sing (according to the practice) as They did the Old.

Wherein I shall desire my aim may be rightly understood, which was to render
Them rather with perspicuity and plainness for the vulgar use, then Elegance.
For this the disadvantage of the Measure (of All others least graceful)
wherein most of the Psalms run, allows not: especially when by design I deny
my self the liberty of those words and Phrases, which either suit not the
Gravity of the Subject, or capacity of the Meanest. To this end I have so
closely followed the New Translation of the Psalms in our Church Bibles, that
He who is able to read the one, may perceive the Reason of the Text neither
lost, nor abused in the Rhyme; Both which without much Un evennesse, or force
are brought to an easy and familiar agreement.

Indeed where the Place is obscure, and the Construction difficult, I take
leave by paraphrase to give the Meaning: which is a method of times observed by
the Sepiuagint, whose Version Moralizeth in the Greek, what was wrapped up in
figures by the Hebrew. As to instance in one for all, in Psalm 84. verse 6.
What our Translation from the Original terms The Valley of Baca, or of Mulbery
Trees (as the Margin has it) meaning thereby a place oppressed with drought and
Barrenness, where those Trees commonly grow, The Greek reads (...), Vallem
sitientem and ob id ad fletum excitantem. Vatablus.
the valley of Mourning, or of Tears, from the sad effects (says Vatablus)
which so wretched a Place produces, wherein passengers were constreined (for
want of other) to drink Rain water, kept in pits dug for that purpose.

This course as it is most useful, so I hope needs no excuse; for else how
should the Congregation observe the Psalmists rule, Psalm. 47. 7
To sing with understanding, when they understand not what they Sing. The
serving God upon Others scoare whom we believe mean well is a fair way to
Sing implicit Faith into a Church whose Orthodox Divines both in their Pulpits
and writings have so often Said it out.

Neither will any (I hope) be so severe as to conclude, That it is not David's
Psalm^, but Ours, so long as we Sing it in His sense, though not always
according to His strict Letter. For as it is not to be expected from a
Translatour, that he should verbum verbo reddere, give word for word: so with
the learned Andraeas Viega, Histor. Council. Tridentin: Lib. 2 An. 1546
I must conclude it impossible, that all the words of one Language should be
transplanted into Another, but that there will be some restriction or
enlargement of significations. And however One who thus precisely binds
himself to a Liter all interpretation may please himself, He can neither inform
Those who are less learned, nor keep them from apprehensions of prejudice upon
the Text: Since that which in the Hebrew is an Elegance, rendered in another
Language according to the Words would be (to say no worse) perplexed and
barbarous, inducing men, through this defect of the Interpreter, to suspect
that The Holy Ghost dictated, and the Church commended some things to the
Peoples use, which need not be understood.

Besides this advantage of Paraphrase where Places are dark, the Congregation
happily may find Another in the contracting d^vers Psalms, formerly divided
into several Parts; so that now, unless some Few, the most without these
fractions and interruptions may be sung entirely at Once, not borrowing too
much time out of that which is allotted to Other Duties.

I have no more to add, But as the Service of God was my first aim, so I shall
account my labor fully recompensed, if it proves useful, or acceptable to The
most Renowned Mother Church of England: Under whose First establishment and
happy Reformation, in the Best and most Orthodox Times, I profess my self by
all obligations of Duty and Devotion an obedient Son, and faithful servant.

PSALM. I.
VERSE 1.
THe man is blessed whose feet not tread,
By wicked counsels led:
Nor stands in that perverted way,
In which the Sinners stray;
Nor joins himself unto the chair,
Where Scorners seated are;
2.
But in God's Law both days and nights
To meditate delights.
3.
He shall be like a Planted Tree
We near the Rivers see:
Whose branches by their moisture spring,
And fruits in season bring.
4.
No parching droughts his leaf invade,
Or make his blossom fade.
For God will his endeavors bless
With prosperous success.
5.
But wicked men themselves shall find
Like chaff blow'n by the wind.
6.
Nor in the final Judgment must
Stand up among the Just.
7.
For God the righteous guides, and knows
The path wherein he goes:
When ways of Sinners perish shall
In their eternal fall.
PSALM. II.
1.
WHy do the furious Heathen rage?
Vain people why engage?
2.
Kings of the Earth a Party make,
And Rulers counsel take.
Who against the Lord that Earth does sway,
And His Anointed, say,
3.
Break we the Bonds They on us lay,
And cast Their Cords away.
4.
But God, who does the Heavens guide,
Shall them in Scorn deride,
5.
Then shall His soar displeasure break,
And He in anger speak.
6.
Yet have I set my King on high,
Adorned with Majesty:
Upon Mount Sion raised the throne*
Of mine Anointed one.
7.
I will declare that firm decree,
The Lord has said to me.
Thou ar't my Son, without all spot,
This day I thee begot.
8.
Ask me, and thine Inheritance
Ore Nations I Will advance:
Far as the earth, or Sea extends,
Are thy Possessions ends.
9.
Thou with an Iron Rod shall bruise
Such as thy power refuse.
And like a Potters Vessel broak,
So dash them by thy stroke.
10.
O therefore all ye Kings that awe
The Nations with your Law;
Ye Judges of the earth be wise:
His Scepter not despise.
11.
Serve ye the Lord with holy fear;
Rejoice, yet reverence bear*
12.
And kiss the Son, before his wrath
Your way consumed has.
For if a little that increase,
Where can we seek for Peace?
Since they are only safe, and blessed,
Whose hope in Him does rest.
PSALM. III.
1.
O Lord, how fast do they increase,
Who troubled have my Peace?
They many are, who against me rise,
And are my enemies.
2.
Many there be my Soul upbraid,
And say, God cannot aid.
3.
But Lord! Thou art my Shield, my Praise:
Thou shall my head up-raise.
4.
To God my loud request did cry,
Who heard my voice from high.
5.
I laid me down, and rose again:
For He did me sustain.
6.
Then though ten thousands me invade,
I will not be afraid.
No, though with threats the furious rowt
Encompasse me about.
7.
Arise, and save me O my God:
For with thy vengefull rod
Thou smit'st the cheek, and break'st the jaws
Of such as hate thy Laws.
8.
To Thee O Lord our God alone
Belongs Salvation.
Who do Thy blessings evermore
Upon Thy People power.
PSALM. IV.
1.
GOd of my righteousness attend,
When my requests ascend.
Thou have enlarged me in distress,
And eased my heaviness.
2.
How long O Mortals will ye shame
The glory of my Name?
How long will ye love vanities,
And take delight in Lies?
3.
Know that the Lord elected has
Men of unmoved faith.
He, when before His throne I cry,
Will not my suite deny.
4.
Stand of His greatness then in awe,
Nor sin against His Law.
When on your bed retired, and still,
O meditate his will?
5.
Of Righteousness the Offering
To God your maker bring:
And on the hope of His defense,
Place all your confidenc^.
6.
Yet some, who Him not understood,
Ask, who shall do us good?
Lord let thy face, and beams divine,
On us thy servants shine.
7.
Thou fill'st my heart with greater joys,
Then theirs, whom plenty cloyes.
Who reap their fruits in time of peace,
whose Corn, and Wine increase.
8.
I lay me down, with quiet blessed,
To take my sleep, and rest:
For thou, whose goodness does excel,
Make me in safety dwell.
PSALM. V.
1.
LOrd, Ponder what my words relate,
Weigh what I meditate.
2.
My God and King my cry attend:
To Thee my Prayers I send.
3.
My voice O Lord shall in the morn
Up to thy Throne be borne.
Betimes will I direct my cry,
And look to thee on high.
4.
For thou in Sin take no delight,
No ill dwells in thy sight.
5.
The foolish stand not in thine eye,
Who hat'st iniquity.
6.
Thou shall the lying lips destroy,
Who leasing make their joy.
God will the bloody minded hate,
And punish all deceit.
7.
But I, presuming on Thy care,
Will to thy House repair:
And toward thy Temple in thy fear,
Due adoration bear.
8.
Me Lord in righteousness dispose,
Beset with watchful foes.
Make straight thy way before my face,
And guide me by thy grace.
9.
No faithfulness their mouth contains,
Their heart foul Malice stains.
Wide Sepulchers are their black throats,
Their tongues but flattering notes.
10.
O God destroy, and let them all
By their own Counsels fall;
Themselves by their transgressions quell,
Who against Thy power rebel.
11.
But let all faithful ones rejoice,
And showt with cheerful voice:
Because Thy love, which knows no end,
Does ever them defend.
12.
Let those rejoice, in Thee who trust;
For Thou will bless the Just:
And with Thy favor, as a shield,
In danger safety yield.
PSALM. VI.
1.
REbuke me not O Lord in wrath,
Whose sin deserved it has:
Nor let thy hot displeasure burn,
Least I to nothing turn.
2.
Have pity Lord, for I am weak,
Ashamed my sins to speak.
O heal me, for my bones are vexed,
My Soul with grief perplexed.
3.
How long shall I lament, and cry,
For my delivery?
4.
O turn! and me to favor take,
For thine own mercies sake.
5.
Can he, who looses life's short breath,
Remember Thee in death?
Or will the dust, and silence raise
A voice to sound Thy praise?
6.
Weary, and faint, my soul bemoanes
Her vain and fruitless groans.
My bed the mark of sorrow wears,
Each night bedewed with tears.
7.
My sight is dim, my melting eye
Clouded with misery.
I languish, through my haters rage,
Into untimely age.
8.
Depart from me all wicked ones;
The Lord has heard my moanes.
My voice of weeping, and my tears
Sound lowdly in His ears.
9.
God, who my supplication takes,
In Pardon answer makes.
When their despite, who me defame,
Shall covered be with shame.
PSALM. VII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
O Lord my God in thee I trust;
Deliver me from the unjust.
2.
Least Lyon-like my soul he tear,
Whilst none is for my reskue near.
3.
Lord if this guilt upon me stands,
Or wickedness be in my hands;
4.
If friend I ill rewarded have,
Or causeless foe I did not save:
5.
Then let mine enemy pursue,
Let him my captive soul subdue:
Let him my life to earth down thrust,
And lay mine honor in the dust.
6.
O Lord! in thy fierce wrath arise;
Take vengeance on mine enemies.
7.
The people then shall me come nigh;
For their sakes lift thy self on high.
8.
The Lord his judgment shall dispense,
According to mine innocence:
9.
O let all wicked counsels end;
But just men stablish, and defend.
10.
For God the heart and reins does try;
Preserves men of integrity.
11.
God does in right his judgments lay;
Yet is provoked every day.
12.
If he not turn, His sword is whet;
His bow is bent, and ready set.
13.
The instruments of death He brings,
And arrows from His quiver flings.
14.
Behold he travailes great with hate,
Mischief conceaves, brings forth deceit:
15.
He made a ditch, and dig'd a Pit,
And he himself is fallen in it.
16.
Thus all his practices revert,
To strike his own malicious heart.
His mischief shall his own head wound;
His violence himself confound.
17.
I will the praise of God express,
According to His righteousness:
And in my Songs extol the fame
Of His most high, most glorious Name.
PSALM. VIII.
1.
LOrd! how excelling is Thy Name
Through earths extended frame!
Who have Thy glory set on high,
Above the starry sky.
2.
Thou did by infant mouths ordain
Renown and strength to gain:
Whose weakness might thy foes confound,
And the Avenger wound.
3.
When I consider, Heavens state
Thy fingers did create;
The Moon, with all the Stars of night,
To which thy beams gave light:
4.
O what is Man, or all his race,
Thy favor should him grace?
5.
Whom, made next Angels in renown,
Thou will with glory crown.
6.
Thou under his command have laid
The works Thy hand had made.
What in each element does meet,
Is subject to his feet.
8.
All sheep, and beasts which range the field,
The fowls which air does yield:
The Fishes, which their motion keep
Within the liquid deep.
8.
O Lord our Governor, whose sway
All in the world obey!
How far excelling is Thy Name
Through earths extended frame!
PSALM. IX.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
I Thee will praise with my whole heart,
And all thy wondrous works impart:
In Songs, and Hymns rejoice will I,
2.
To bless Thy Name, O Thou most high.
Mine enemies repulsed all
Shall at Thine awful presence fall.
4.
Thou have my righteous cause maintained,
Whose throne wrong judgment never stained.
5.
At Thy rebuke the Heathens fame
Destroyed is, put out their name.
O thou malicious enemy,
6.
Thy loathed remembrance now must die.
And like the Cities thou have rased,
Thine own Memorial is defaced.
7.
But God for ever shall endure,
His throne in judgment stablish'd sure.
8.
The world He Will judge in righteousness;
9*
A Refuge be in times distress:
10.
Who know Thy Name in Thee will trust,
For Thou have never left the just.
11.
Praise God, who does in Sion dwell;
His doings to the people tell.
12.
When He enquires for Blood, the Cry
Nere passes from His memory.
13*
Have mercy on my troubled state,
O Lord, who lift'st me from death's gate:
14.
That Sion I thy praise may show,
Whose joys from thy Salvation grow.
15.
Sunk to the Pit the Heathen are;
Their feet are caught in their own snare,
16.
The Lord in their revenge is known,
Who by themselves are overthrow'n.
17.
The wicked shall be turned to hell,
And all, who God forgetting, fell.
18.
For on the poor He thinks always,
Nor shall the Needies hope decay.
19.
Up Lord! and let not man prevail,
Nor let thy judgments ever fail.
20.
Put them in fear; the Nations then
Will know themselves to be but men.
PSALM. X.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
WHy (Lord!) do Thou so far abide?
Thy face in times of trouble hide?
2.
Proud men the helpless persecute;
But let them fall in the pursuit.
3.
He boasts in his own desires,
And wretches, whom God hates, admires.
4.
Through pride of heart he God neglects,
Whom he nor thinks on, nor affects.
5.
His grievous ways Thy judgments slight;
His thoughts do fear no opposite.
6.
He said, I never shall be moved,
Nor by adversity be proved.
7.
His mouth deceit and curses fill;
Whilst mischiefs from his tongue distill.
8.
He lurkes to kill the innocent;
His eyes against the poor are bent.
9.
He as a Lion lies in wait*
To catch the guiltless through deceit.
10.
With humble shows he does assay
To make the poor his strong ones prey.
11.
His heart has said, God has forgot:
He hides His face, and sees not.
12.
O God, lift up thy self, arise,
And think upon our miseries.
13.
Why does his pride, and scorn surmount?
As if that God kept no account;
Nor will his wicked works require,
Or in His judgments pay their hire.
14.
Lord! Thou have seen his impious spite,
Whose hand their follies can requite.
He trusts on Thee, whom woes oppress,
Who still do help the fatherless.
15.
Break Thou their wicked arm at length,
And let them perish by Thy strength.
16.
Thou can, O Lord, Eternal King,
The Heathen to destruction bring.
17.
Thou hear'st Thy servants humble plaint;
Prepar'st their heart, art swift to grant:
18.
To judge the poor and fatherless,
That men of earth no more oppress.
PSALM. XI.
1.
IN God I put my trust: How then
Do ye reproachful men
Say, To the mountains fly my soul,
Like to the chased foul?
2.
For lo, the wicked bend their bow,
Their deadly shafts to throw;
That privily in darkness they
The upright in heart may slay.
3.
If the foundations perish so,
What can the righteous do?
4.
But in His Temple God resides,
Whose throne in Heaven abides.
He all beholds with searching eye,
The Sons of men to try.
The Lord His righteous servants proves;
Hates him oppression loves.
He snares, with fire and brimstone showers,
Upon the wicked powers:
Black tempests are by Him raised up,
The portion of their cup.
7.
For the just God does those respect
Who righteousness affect.
His countenance, and favor bright
Beholds the upright.
PSALM: XII.
1.
Help Lord, for godly men decrease;
Goodness on earth does cease:
And, like all other Mortals frail,
The faithful Persons fail.
2.
Each to his neighbor vainly speaks,
And to deceive him seeks:
With fratt'ring Lips, and double hearts,
They use deceitful arts.
3.
God shall cut off their guile-full tongues,
Puffed up with pride and wrongs:
4.
Who say, Our words their ends shall gain:
What Lord can us restrain?
5.
But for th'oppressions of the poor,
Whose sighs their want deplore;
Now, says the Lord, will I arise
To ease their miseries.
6.
The words, which from the Lord we hear,
Are pure, and most sincere:
As Silver in the furnace tried,
And sev'n times purified.
7.
Thou shall, O Lord, keep Thine Elect,
And from this race protect.
8.
The wicked live esteemed, and praised,
When vilest men are raised.
PSALM. XIII.
1.
HOw long Lord! Will thou me forget?
Who am with woes beset.
Shall I still languish in disgrace,
Whilst Thou do hide thy Face?
2.
How long shall I without relief
Take counsel of my grief?
How long will Thou my soul expose
To her insulting foes?
3.
Consider, Lord! my Prayer hear,
When I my hands up-reare.
Lighten mine eyes, ere loss of breath
Cause me to sleep in death.
4.
Lest that mine enemy prevail,
Triumphing when I fail:
And those that trouble me be glad,
When they behold me sad.
5.
But in thy Mercy, Lord, and Grace,
My constant trust I place.
My glad heart shall rejoice alone
In thy salvation.
6.
I will my grateful Anthems sing
Unto the Heavenly King;
Who with such bountiful regard
His servants does reward.
PSALM. XIV.
Sing this as Psalm 100.
1.
THe fool within his heart has said,
There is no God that all things made.
Corrupt and wicked are their facts;
Nor is there one who goodness acts.
2.
The Lord from Heaven down did look,
And view of all man's children took:
To see if any knowledge sought,
Or upon God would place his thought.
3.
But all of them are gone aside,
And in their filthiness abide:
Throughout their numbers there is none
That good performs; No, not one.
4.
Do then all knowledge thus defy
Those workers of iniquity?
Who eat my people up as bread,
And never God have worshipped.
5.
Affrighted they, and stricken were
With great amaze, and sudden fear.
For God amongst the righteous race
Is ever present by His Grace.
6.
The poor man's counsel, and his faith
Your shameless malice mocked has;
Because he God his refuge makes,
And sure protection from Him takes.
7.
O who, that Israel may live,
Salvation will from Sion give?
When God shall His from bondage free,
Then Jacobs race shall joyful be.
PSALM. XV.
1.
LOrd! who shall in thy dwelling bide?
Or on Thy Hill reside?
2.
Even he whose life, and deeds are right;
Whose words in truth delight.
3.
He who reviles not with his tongue,
Nor does his neighbor wrong:
Who none with slanders does backbite,
Or undeserved spite.
4.
Who in his pure, impartial eyes
Vile persons does despise:
But love and honor does afford
To them that fear the Lord.
5.
Whose mind not alters, if he swear,
Though he a Iooser were:
6.
Nor by extortion wealth contracts,
Nor lawless use exacts.
Nor to betray the innocent
For wicked bribes is bent.
7.
Who so does this, shall never move
Out of his Makers love.
PSALM. XVI.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
PReserve O God, and succor me,
Who put my faithful trust in Thee.
2.
Thou O my Soul to Him have said,
Thou ar't my Lord and only aid.
To Thee my goodness not extends,
No merit nor perfection lends.
3.
But my delight on Saints is placed,
By most excelling virtues graced.
4.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied,
Who have on other Gods relied:
To th^se I no burnt offering,
Nor bloody sacrifice will bring;
Of them I neither mention make,
Nor in my lips their Names will take.
5.
Thou only, Who my portion ar't,
Shall have the duties of my heart.
God fills my Cup, and does advance
The lot of mine inheritance:
6.
My lines in pleasant places laid
A wealthy heritage have made.
7.
Thee therefore will I ever bless,
Who gav'st me counsel in distress,
And by Thy warnings do invite
My reins to serve Thee in the night.
8.
I set the Lord before mine ey,
And hold Him in my memory;
Whilst He assists at my right hand,
I steadfast and unmoved stand.
9.
This glads my heart, my Glory shall
Rejoice, how low so ere I fall:
And in the grave my flesh shall rest,
With hope to Rise again possessed.
10.
Thou will not leave my Soul in Hell
Eternally condemned to dwell;
Nor suffer Thy Holy one
In death to see corruption.
11.
Thou will the path of Life declare,
At whose Right Hand and Presence are
Such pleasures which no time shall end,
And joys no thought can comprehend.
PSALM. XVII.
1.
LOrd hear the right, my cry attend;
My prayer, which lips unfeigned send:
2.
Judge me, and with impartial eye
Behold my causes equity.
3.
Thou prov'st my heart, and in the night
Visit'st, and try'st, and find'st me right.
I in my purposed thoughts profess,
That never shall my mouth transgress.
4.
Thy word has kept me from men's works,
And paths where the destroyer lurkes.
5.
Hold up my goings in thy way,
That so my footsteps never stray.
6.
I called on thee, who ar't inclined
My voice to hear, my speech to mind.
7.
O show thy kindness, thou, whose hand
Sav'st them that trust, when foes withstand.
8.
Keep as the Apple of the eye,
And by Thee shadowed let me lie:
9.
From wicked men, and deadly foes,
Whose strong oppressions me enclose.
10.
For they with fatnes swollen, and pride,
11.
Have compassed us, and closely eyed:
12.
Like Lions greedy of their prey,
Or Lions whelps, they lurking lay.
13.
Arise O Lord, and in thy frown,
Both disappoint, and cast him down.
Deliverance to my soul afford
From wicked men, who are thy sword.
14.
From men, I say, who are thy hand,
To punish sinners in the land:
Whom pleasures of the world enslave,
And in this life their portion have.
Thou giv'st them treasure at their will,
Their belly do with plenty fill:
Who full of Children at their death
Their substance to their race bequeath.
15.
But I behold Thy glorious sight
And presence will in endless light;
And waked from death, with thee abide,
With Thy blessed likeness satisfied.
PSALM. XVIII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
I Thee will love, O Lord my power;
Thou art my fortress, rock, and tower:
2.
My God, my trust, my confidence;
My horn of safety, and defense.
3.
To God most praised I send my Cries,
Who saves me from mine enemies:
4.
When pangs of circling death prevailed,
And floods of wicked men assailed.
5.
I compassed am with pains of Hell;
The snares of death about me dwell.
6.
To God I cried, distressed and grieved;
Who from His Temple me relieved.
7.
The earth then trembled at His wrath,
Which Her foundations shaken has.
8.
A smoke from out His nostrills came,
And from His mouth devouring flame.
9.
He bowed the Heavens, and came down;
Beneath His feet was darkness throw'n:
10.
On flying Cherubs He did ride;
11.
On wings of Wind through Heaven glide:
Thick darkness His Pavilion made;
And watery Clouds the sky orelay'd.
12.
Yet at His brightness those gave place;
Whilst hail and fire powered down apace.
13
His voice was heard in thunders loud;
And coals fell from the breaking Cloud:
14.
His shafts dispersed them, as they flew,
Their force His darted lightnings slew.
15.
The Oceans Channel did appear;
The world's foundations naked were,
At Thy rebuke, O Lord, and blast,
Which Thy incensed Nostrills cast.
16.
He me from many waters took,
17.
My too strong foes with vengeance struck.
18.
They me in day of trouble seized;
But God my stay those sorrows eased.
19.
He brought me to a spacious place,
Deliv'ring me through His free grace.
20.
He did my righteousness regard,
And cleanness of my hands reward.
21.
For I the ways of God have kept;
Nor wickedly His precepts left.
22.
His judgments I, and statutes, prize;
Still placing them before my eyes.
23.
I perfect was, and innocent;
Nor to ungodly courses bent;
24.
Therefore as guiltless, and upright,
I am rewarded in His sight.
Second Part.
25.
Thou to the merciful art kind;
26.
And pure, where Thou do pureness find.
27.
But with the froward art perverse;
Do save the poor, the proud disperse.
28.
For thou my candle wilt make bright,
And turn my darkness into light.
29.
By Thee I made a Troop to fall;
And through my God leaped ore a wall.
30.
God's way is perfect, His word tried
Does as a shield the faithful hide.
31.
Who can like Him a Savior be?
Or who a Rock to us, but He?
32.
It Is God that girdeth me with might,
And keeps me in my ways upright:
33.
My feet, like Hind's, He makes swift,
And to high places does me lift.
34.
It Is He does teach my hands to war;
Steel bows by them now broken are.
35.
Thou wast my shield, Thy hand sustained:
I through Thy favor greatness gained.
36.
My feet enlarged have not failed;
37.
Against foes pursuit my hands prevailed:
38.
Whose pride now quite confounded lies,
Wounded and fallen, no more to rise.
39.
Thou girdest me with strength for fight,
And have subdued the rebels might:
40.
Their captive necks below me bend,
And in deserved destruction end.
41.
They cried for safety, 'midst their fear;
But God nor help them would, nor hear.
42.
Like dust blow'n up, so did I beat,
And tread them down in their retreat.
43.
From mutiny, and peoples strife
O Lord, Thou resku'd have my life.
My head ore Nations Thou do crown;
Those serve me, whom I have not known.
44.
Soon as they hear, they me obey;
And strangers stoop unto my sway.
45.
The aliens away shall fade,
And their close places leave dismayed.
46*
Blessed be my Rock, who ever lives;
Exalt Him, who Salvation gives.
47.
It Is God whose vengeance does pursue,
And people under me subdue.
48.
He saves me from mine enemies,
And lifts me up 'bove those that rise.
He is my reskue, my defense,
From men of blood and violence.
49.
Therefore will I to Thee O Lord,
My thanks Eternally record:
Amongst the Heathen speak Thy fame,
And praises sing unto Thy Name.
30.
He great deliverance does bring,
In love to His anointed King:
His mercies does on David power,
And on his seed, for evermore.
PSALM. XIX.
1.
THe Heavens high declare the fame
Of God, who did them frame.
2.
One day another tells, and night
His wonders does recite.
3.
They have no language, yet they teach,
Without or tongue, or speech:
4.
And through the earth their sound is gone
To every Nation.
God in the Circle of those spheres
A Tabernacle reares;
In which the swift, unwearied Sun
His daily course may run.
5.
Who, as a Bridegroom freshly decked,
Does on the world reflect:
And, as a Giant strong in might,
Darts forth his piercing light.
6.
He breaking from the Eastern skies
Does from his Chambers rise:
And till his beams declining set,
Nothing can shun his heat.
7.
Gods Law is incorrupt, and whole;
Converting every Soul.
His faithful promise never dies;
And makes the simple wise.
8.
The Statutes of the Lord are right,
And drooping hearts delight.
Both pure, and perfect, His command
Gives light to understand.
9.
Most unpolluted is His fear,
Eternal, and sincere.
The judgments of the Lord are fixed;
With Truth and Justice mixed.
10.
More to be wished then golden mines,
When them the test refines:
And more then honey that distills,
The mouth with sweetnessefills.
11.
By These Thy servant warned is,
Often as he goes amiss:
Which yield a plentiful reward
To all that Them regard.
12.
Who knows how often he offends?
How far his sin extends?
Lord cleanse my Soul from crimes concealed,
To none but Thee revealed.
13.
Keep me, that no presumptuous stain
May ore Thy Servant reign.
Then shall I walk in innocence,
Free from the great offense.
14.
O Lord! my only strength and tower,
Who sav'st me by Thy power;
Let all my words, and thoughts, by Thee
Heard, and accepted be.
PSALM. XX.
1.
THe Lord in thy afflictions day
Give ear when thou do pray.
The Name of Jacob's God defend,
On whom thy hopes depend.
2.
Help from His Sanctuary send,
And strength from Sion lend.
3.
Thy Gifts in His remembrance prize;
Accept thy sacrifice.
4*
May He, who comforts does inspire,
Grant thee thy heart's desire:
Make thee enjoy thy wishes still;
Thy counsels all fulfill.
5.
With thankful and triumphant voice
We in Thy help rejoice:
And in Thy Name our banners rear,
Who wilt thy servants hear.
6.
Now know I, God, who power gave,
Does His Anointed save.
He hears from Heaven, and His right hand
Makes him in safety stand.
7.
Some in their armed Chariots force,
Some put their trust in horse:
But we remember will the Lord,
Whose Name does strength afford.
8.
They are brought down, and fallen in war;
We raised in triumph are.
9.
O save us Lord, great Heavens King,
Hear those requests we bring.
PSALM. XXI.
1.
THe King shall in Thy strength be glad;
Through Thee with safety clad.
2.
Thou gav'st him all his heart desired,
And what his lips required.
3.
Thou did no good from him withhold;
Crownd'st him with purest gold.
4.
He asked life, and Thou did give
Him endless days to live.
5.
Great Majesty does him invest,
Through Thy Salvation blessed.
Thou giv'st him joy, and lasting grace,
The favor of Thy face.
7.
The King on God his trust has placed,
Whose Mercy keeps Him fast:
8.
Thy right hand all Thy foes shall find,
Whose hate against Thee combined.
9.
Thy wrath shall those, who Thee forsake,
A fiery Oven make.
The Lord shall swallow them in ire,
By His revenges fire.
10.
Their fruit shall Thou destroy from earth,
Root out their childrens birth;
11.
For they against Thee did ill invent,
Though fayl'd in their intent.
12.
When at their face Thine arrows aim,
They turn their back with shame,
13.
O Lord! Thy strength and glory raise;
So we Thy power will praise.
PSALM. XXII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
MY God, My God upon me look;
O wherefore have Thou me forsook?
Why help'st Thou not, when I implore?
Nor hear'st, when I through anguish roar?
2*
O God by day to Thee I cry;
But Thou Thy audience do deny:
And in the night, when I should sleep,
My sorrows will not silence keep.
3.
But Thou in Holiness do dwell,
O Thou the praise of Israel!
4.
Our Fathers placed their trust in Thee;
And Thy deliverance set them free.
5.
They cried to Thee, surpised with fear,
And from Confusion saved were.
6.
But I a worm, and no man am;
Reproach of men, and peoples shame.
7
Beholders Me their pastime make,
Shoot out their lip, their head they shake.
8.
He trusted God, that He would save:
See, if from him he safety have.
9.
But Thou did take me from the womb;
And ever since my hope become.
10.
On Thee, when on the breast I hung,
And from the birth, my care was flung.
11.
When trouble's near, O be not far:
Since left to me no helpers are.
12.
For many bulls with bellowing sound,
Strong bulls of Bashan girt me round.
13.
They gape like Lions Me about;
14.
I am like water powered out.
My bones disjoynted torture crackes;
My heart within me melts like Wax.
15
My strength is like a Pot-sheard dried;
My tongue up to my Palate tied.
16.
Thou brought me down unto the grave:
For dogs my life encompast have.
Assemblies of the wicked meet;
They pierced have my hands and feet:
17.
My bones stick out, consumed and bare;
Whilst they remorselesse on me stare.
18.
They now to part my garments have,
And Lots upon my vesture cast.
19.
But be not far from me, O Lord;
20.
My soul deliver from the sword.
21
My darling save from rav'ning jaws
Of dogs, and from the Lions paws.
For thou have heard me from the horns
Of fierce assayling Unicornes.
22.
I to my brethren will proclaim
The Praises due to Thy great Name.
23.
Ye that fear God, all Jacobs line,
And Isreal's seed in Praises join.
24.
The afflicted He did nere despise;
Nor hid His face, but heard their cries.
25.
My praise, and vows devout to Thee
Shall in thy Church performed be.
26*
He to the meek will plenty give:
The hearts, that seek Him, ever live.
27.
Far as the world extends it is bound,
Religious Converts shall be found.
They shall remember, and implore;
And every Kindred Him adore.
28
For God's the Kingdom is, whose sway
All Nations of the Earth obey.
29.
The rich, who on Earth's fatness feed;
Even to the Soul that dies for need;
All from the throne unto the dust,
Before Him bow, and worship must.
30.
All these shall serve Him in their seed,
And sons to God adopted breed:
31.
Who to succession shall proclaim
His righteousness, and awful Name.
PSALM. XXIII.
1.
THe Lord my Shepherd is, and guide;
I shall no want abide.
2.
He makes me lie in fruitful meads,
And by still waters leads.
3.
My Soul to danger given ore
He does again restore;
And guides me in the righteous path
His Name elected has.
4.
Yea though in vale of darkness laid,
Or death's more ghastly shade,
I fear no ill: Thy rod, and staff
Direct, and keep me safe.
5.
Thou do for me a plenteous fare
Before my foes prepare.
Thou do with oil anoint my head;
My flowing Cup does shed.
6.
Thy mercy sure shall me attend,
Until my Life does end:
And in the House of God will I
Remain Eternally.
PSALM: XXIV.
1.
EArth is the Lords, with her increase;
And all that there have place.
2.
He founded it upon the Seas,
And made the floods her base.
3.
Who in God's Holy Place shall stand;
Or on His Hill appear?
4.
He, who is pure in Heart, and hand;
Nor to deceive does swear.
5.
He blessings shall from God receive,
And righteousness from high.
6.
This is their race, who God believe,
And to His sight are nigh.
7.
Lift up ye Gates, lift up your head,
Ye Doors Eternal spread:
The King of Glory shall come in;
And his approach begin.
8.
Who is the Great, and Glorious King,
Of whom our Praises sing?
The Lord in Battle mighty, This
The King of Glory is.
9.
Lift up ye Gates, lift up your Head,
Ye Doors Eternal spread.
The King of Glory shall come in,
And his approach begin.
10.
Who is the Great, and Glorious King,
Of whom our Praises sing?
The Lord in Battle mighty, This
The King of Glory is.
PSALM. XXV.
1.
WIth Thoughts lift up to Thee
O God my Soul does flee.
2.
To shame O never me expose;
Nor triumph of my foes.
3.
Let those be free from shame,
Who wait upon Thy Name;
But let them feel it, who Thy Laws
Transgress without a cause.
4.
Thy ways unto me show;
Teach me Thy truth to know.
5.
Thon art the God do me defend;
On Thee I still depend.
6.
Think on Thy mercies Lord!
Thy ancient love record.
7.
Remember not my sins of youth;
But save me in Thy truth.
8.
Good is the Lord: His ways
To sinners He displaies.
9.
The meek He will in judgment guide,
Who in His precepts bide.
10.
His paths with truth abound;
Great mercies there are found:
Which He unto all such does grant,
Who keep his Covenant.
11.
O for Thy Names sake Lord,
Pardon to me afford!
And with my heinous crime dispense;
For great is mine offense.
12.
To him that fears, He shows
The way which he shall choose;
13.
His Soul shall dwell at ease; his race
Shall long on earth have place.
14.
To them who God do fear,
His secret shall appear.
He will His Covenant declare
To such as faithful are.
15.
Mine eyes on God are set,
Who plucks me from the net.
16.
O Lord to we in mercy turn,
Afflicted, and forlorn.
17.
My heart's distress is large:
O Thou my woes discharge.
18.
Look on the pain wherein I live,
And all my sins forgive.
19.
Think on my many foes,
Whose hate most cruel grows.
20.
O keep my soul from scandal free,
Who put my trust in Thee.
21.
Let Justice me defend,
Who on Thy grace attend.
22.
Thy Israel O God release,
And all his troubles ease.
PSALM. XXVI.
1.
Judge me (O God,) for in Thy path
My foot insisted has.
My trust has on Thee Lord relied;
Therefore I shall not slide.
2.
Examine me (O Lord,) and try;
My reins and heart descry.
3.
Thy mercy still is in my sight;
Thy truth has kept me right.
4.
I have not with vain persons sat,
Or those that use deceit:
5.
Ill congregations I detest;
Nor am the sinners guest.
6.
In innocence I Will wash my hand;
So at Thine Altar stand:
7.
That I may publish in my Song
What thanks to Thee belong.
8
O Lord! devoutly I affect
The House Thou do Elect.
I Love the honor of that Place
Thy presence deignes to grace.
9.
Shut not my soul, nor judge my life,
With men of blood and strife:
10.
Whose arm it self in mischief lifts;
Whose hand is filled with gifts.
11.
In mine integrity I go;
Save me, and mercy show.
12.
So will I Praise Thee, when my feet
Within Thy Temple meet.
PSALM. XXVII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
GOd my Salvation is, and Light:
What terror then shall me affright?
My life's sole strength He is, and aid.
Of whom then shall I be afraid?
2.
When wicked men, mine enemies,
Conspiring did against me rise;
When they approached my flesh to eat,
They stumbling fell in their retreat.
3.
Although an host encamped were;
My heart their numbers shall not fear.
And though a War against me rise,
My confidence shall them despise.
4.
One thing of God I have desired;
That I, unto His House retired,
Might spend my days, and there grow old,
His Temples beauty to behold.
5.
For He, when times of trouble threat,
Will me in his Pavilion seat;
Within His Tabernacle hide,
And safety on a rock provide.
6.
And now my head up-lifted shall
Behold my foes encircling fall:
Therefore glad Songs, and sacrifice,
With praises to Thy throne shall rise.
7.
Hear, (O my Lord,) and when I cry,
In mercy to my voice reply.
8.
When Thou command'st: Seek ye my face;
My heart O Lord, I seek Thee, says.
9.
Hide not Thy face from me in ire;
Nor leave me helpless, I desire:
10.
Who, when my Parents me forsake,
Wilt me unto Thy favor take.
11.
Teach me, O Lord Thy ways to tread;
In paths of truth and plainness lead.
12.
Nor leave me to their cruel will,
Who raise false witness, me to kill.
13.
I fainted had, but for belief,
In endless life to find releife.
Wait on the Lord, of courage be;
O wait on Him, will strengthen Thee.
PSALM. XXVIII.
1.
TO Thee (O Lord) my Rock, I cry;
Forbear not to reply:
Least I be, if Thou silence keep,
Like those in death that sleep.
2.
Hear Thou the voice of my request,
In accents loud expressed:
When I with lifted hands entreat
Before thy Mercy seat.
3.
O draw me not with sinners hence,
Whose works are Thy offense:
Who when their hearts would mischief wreake,
Peace to their neighbor speak.
4.
Give them according to their deeds,
And wicked labors feeds:
And in the works they did invent,
Render their punishment.
5.
Because Gods works they set at naught,
And what His hand has wrought;
He cast them to destruction shall;
Nor build them when they fall.
6.
Blessed be God, who when I prayed,
Became my shield, and aid.
7.
Therefore my heart in Songs of Praise
With joy His fame shall raise.
8.
He His Anointed does defend;
Strength to His Servants send.
9.
Thy people save; Thine Heritance
To endless bliss advance.
PSALM. XXIX.
1.
Ye Mighty in your Race, and Tribe,
Glory to God ascribe.
2.
In beauty of His holiness
His Name adore and bless.
3.
The Lord by His commanding voice
Brings down the Waters noise.
The Glorious God the Thunder makes,
Which earth's foundation shakes.
4.
He rules the Sea with power from high,
Dreadful in Majesty.
5.
His voice, when He in fury speaks,
The lofty Cedars breaks.
6.
Like sporting Calves the Mountains skip;
Great Lebanon does leap:
And Syrion, by his Motion borne,
Like a young Unicorne.
7.
His voice the flames of fire divides,
From clouds when Lightning glides.
8.
At His rebuke the desert quakes,
And barren Kadesh shakes.
9.
Bring forth He makes the frighted Hinds;
Rends forests with His Winds.
And all His glory must declare,
Who in His Temple are.
10.
God sits above the Watery maine;
Does King for ever reign.
11.
He will His peoples strength increase,
And bless them long with peace.
PSALM. XXX.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1
O Lord, I Thee will magnify;
For Thou have lifted me on high:
Nor made me a scorn to those,
Who were my life's professed foes.
2.
O Lord my God, I cried to Thee,
Who have in mercy healed me.
My Soul Thou brough test from the grave,
And from the pit of Hell did save.
4.
O all ye Saints your voices raise
To sing your Makers endless praise:
Remember still with thanks to bless,
And magnify His Holiness.
5.
For but a Moment lasts His wrath,
His favor life restored has.
Our weeping may endure a night,
But joy comes with the morning light.
6.
In my prosperity I said,
My bases are for ever laid:
I shall not from my place remove,
But stand supported by Thy love.
No change of times, or fortunes hate
Can overthrow my happy state:
For thou my Mountain made so strong,
I shall on earth continue long.
Yet, whilst exalted in my thought,
I was to sudden trouble brought:
And soon as Thou did hide Thy face,
My comforts vanished hence apace.
8.
Then unto Thee, O Lord, did I
With humble supplication cry.
I did to God my plaint address,
Thus pouring forth my heaviness.
9.
O Thou most Glorious, most Good,
What profit is there in my blood?
What triumph can Thou gain by it,
When I go down into the pit?
Shall silent dust, or darkness have
A tongue to praise Thee in the grave?
Or those in earth who closed are,
From their low Cells Thy truth declare?
10.
O Lord Thine ear of mercy lend,
And from Thy dwelling succor send.
11.
For Thou the cause, for which I mourned,
Have into Songs and Dances turned.
My Sackcloth Thou did off me take,
And cheerful robes of gladness make:
12.
That I Thy praises might renew;
To whom incessant thanks are due.
PSALM. XXXI.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
IN Thee O Lord I put my trust:
Save me from shame, as Thou art just.
2.
Bow down Thy gracious ear with speed;
Be Thou my strong defense at need.
3.
For Thou, my Rock, do me protect:
O for Thy Names sake me direct!
4.
Pull me from out the dangerous net
Which they for me have closely set.
5.
My spirit I to Thee commit,
For Thou, O God, did purchase it.
6.
I hate all those, love vanities;
But on the Lord my trust relies.
7.
I joy in Thy compassion show'n,
Who have my Soul in trouble known.
8.
Thou did from hostile hands discharge,
To liberty my feet enlarge.
9.
Have mercy (Lord) and send relief;
Mine eye, and soul both wast with grief.
10.
Through sin I sigh away my days:
My bones consume, my strength decays.
11.
My foes reproach, my neighbors fright
I am; whil^^ friends avoid my sight.
12.
Like to the dead, I sit forgot,
And useless, as a broken pot.
13.
For I their slander heard, and strife,
Who counsel took against my life.
14.
But (Lord!) my trust in Thee is laid;
Thou art my God, my help, I said.
15.
My fleeting times are in Thy hand,
Whose short-lived date by Thee is span'd.
Me never to the power expose,
Or hand, of persecuting foes.
16.
On me O let Thy favor shine:
To save me through Thy grace incline.
17.
Thy servant let no shame befall,
Who daily on Thy Name does call.
Let wicked men confusion have,
Put down to silence in the grave.
18.
And shut the lying lips, that use
The just by slanders to traduce.
19.
O how great goodness have thou wrought,
For those thee fear, whose faith thee sought?
20.
Them shall Thou in Thy presence hide,
Kept safe from men's insulting pride.
And from the tongues malicious strife,
As in a tower, defend their life.
21.
Blessed be God, whose love endures;
Whose strong protect^^n me secures.
22.
I said, though in my have unwise,
I am cut off before Thine eyes.
Yet have Thou not my suit denied,
When in my Prayer to Thee I cried.
23
O Love the Lord, who His regards;
And with revenge the proud rewards.
24.
Be bold, since He such grace imparts,
To strengthen both your hopes, and hearts.
PSALM. XXXII.
1.
BLessed is he, whose wickedness
To pardon finds access:
Whose sin, with all he did amiss,
Forgot, and covered is.
2.
Blessed is the man, to whom The Lord
Imputes no crime abhord:
Whose spirit right, whose heart is straight,
And harbors no deceit.
3.
When I my tongue from speech refrained,
I was with anguish pained.
My bones wax't old through discontent:
My days in moanes were spent.
4.
Thy hand upon me heavy lay;
Not resting night or day.
My Moisture was to nothing brought,
Like fields in Summers drought.
5.
Then I to Thee my sin revealed,
And no offense concealed.
And, soon as my confession said,
My peace with Thee was made.
6.
For this to Thee shall prayer sound,
What time Thou may be found,
Nor shall the floods, which highest go,
Thy servants overflow.
7.
Thou art a refuge me to hide
From dangers troubled tide:
With Songs of Thy delivery
I shall encompast ly.
8.
I will inform thy life, and teach,
How thou this bliss shall reach:
And with mine eye I thee will guide,
Least thou should tread aside.
9.
Be ye not like the horse, or mule,
Whom reason cannot rule:
Whose stubborn mouths the bit, and reine,
From fury must restreine.
10.
Great plagues, and pains that never end,
For wicked men attend.
But those, in God their trust who place,
Sure mercies shall embrace.
Be glad ye righteous, and rejoice,
Who make the Lord your choice.
With shouts alowd your joy impart
All ye upright in heart.
PSALM. XXXIII.
1.
Ye righteous in the Lord delight;
For praise becomes th'upright.
2.
Let Harp and Psaltery's consent,
The ten-string'd instrument,
3.
New Songs record unto the voice
With their melodious noise.
4.
For just Gods promise is to you;
And all His works are true.
5.
He righteousness and judgment wills;
All earth his goodness fills.
6.
The Heavens bright host, and all beneath
He formed with His breath.
7.
He does the waters of the deep
Heaped in His storehouse keep.
8.
Let men, and all which earth does bear,
Of Him then stand in fear.
9.
He spoke, and at His free commands
The world unmoved stands.
10.
Men's counsels and devises wrought
The Lord will bring to naught.
11.
Yet through all ages His decree,
And thoughts unchanged be.
12.
Blessed is the People He protects,
And for His Lot elects.
13.
The Lord from Heaven, His dwelling place,
14.
Beheld all humane race;
15.
Their hearts He fashioned; whose each thought,
And work to light is brought.
16.
No King is saved by multitude;
Nor man with might endu'd.
17.
As vain for safety is the horse,
To reskue by his force.
18.
Who fear, and on Gods love rely,
Are ever in his Eye;
19.
Their Soul to reskue from the grave,
And life from famine save.
20.
Our soul does wait for God our shield;
21.
Glad hopes on Him we build.
22.
Lord let Thy mercy on us be,
As we believe in Thee.
PSALM. XXXIV.
1.
I Will at all times bless the Lord;
His praises still record;
2
And whilst my soul of God makes choice,
The humble shall rejoice.
3.
The Lord with me O magnify;
Exalt His Name on high;
I sought Him, who my prayer heard,
And saved from all I feared.
5.
They looked to Him, and light'ned were;
No shame their faces bear:
6.
For God did at the poor man's cry,
Relieve his misery.
7.
His Angel those environs round,
Who in His fear are sound.
8.
O taste, and see how good is He
To such as faithful be.
9.
O fear the Lord, ye Saints of His;
For such no blessings miss.
10.
Young Lions often lacking prey,
With hunger pine away.
But those that seek His Covenant
No good thing ever want,
11.
Come children, hearken to my speech;
I you His fear will teach.
12.
What man is he, long life does crave;
Or happy days would have?
13.
Keep thou thy tongue from wicked wile,
Thy lips from speaking guile.
14.
Depart from ill, in good increase;
Pursue, and seek for peace.
15.
For on the just God casts His eyes,
His ears admit their cries.
16.
Against the bad He sets his face,
To cut them from their place.
17.
The righteous cry, and God attends;
In trouble safety sends.
18.
He does in broken hearts delight,
And saves souls contrite.
19.
Great troubles on the righteous fall,
But He releives in all.
20.
He keeps the number of each bone;
Nor broken shall be one.
21.
Transgressors their own mischeifs slay,
And with just vengeance pay.
All such as do the righteous hate,
Shall soon be desolate.
22.
For God His servants souls redeems,
And dear their faith esteems.
PSALM. XXXV.
As Psalm 51.
1.
PLead (Lord) my cause with striving foes;
Against them fight who me oppose.
2.
The shield for my Protection wear;
Draw out Thy all-subduing spear.
Stop Thou my persecutors way;
Soul, I am thy salvation, say.
4.
Let them drove back with shame retire,
Who to procure my hurt conspire.
5.
Like chafe before the Whirlwinds blast,
Let them be by God's Angel chased:
6.
Dark be their way, their steps untrue;
And let His Angel them pursue.
7.
For without cause they hid their snare,
And for my soul did pits prepare.
8.
But let themselves surprised all
In their contrived destruction fall.
9.
My soul in God shall joyful be:
10.
My bones all say; who is like to Thee?
Who keep'st the poor from suffering wrong,
And help'st the needy against the strong.
11.
False witness did against me rise,
And things unknown to me devise.
12.
For good they me reward with ill,
To spoil my soul, and life to spill.
13.
Yet when they lay in sickness cast,
I did for them both pray, and fast;
14.
As for my friend, or brother borne,
Or for my Mother did I mourn.
15.
But of my trouble glad they joined:
Yea abjects in my scorn combined.
16.
The mocking hypocrites at feasts,
By flowting me, delight the guests.
17.
How long will Thou look on, O Lord,
Nor reskue to my soul afford?
O save me from destructions jaws;
My darling from the Lions paws.
18.
Then in the great assembly I
Will thanks and praises multiply.
19.
Let not insulting foes despise,
Or wink upon me with their eyes,
20.
They speak not peace, but practice strife,
Disturbing those of quiet life.
21.
Their mouth against me they opened wide;
Ha ha, our eye has seen it, cried.
22.
O Lord! Thou their despite do see:
Nor silence keep, nor absent be.
23.
Stir up Thy self, to judgment wake;
My cause to Thy protection take.
24.
O judge me in Thy truth, least they
25.
With joy, We have him swallowed, say.
26.
But let confounding shame them cloth,
Who love my hurt, my quiet loath.
27.
Let them that favor my just cause,
Extol the Lord with loud applause;
Whose goodness does his servant raise:
28.
And still my tongue shall speak Thy praise.
PSALM. XXXVI.
1.
MY heart of the transgressor says,
No fear of God he has.
2.
Himself he flatters in conceit,
Becoming all men's hate.
3.
His mouth does fraud, and sin devise;
He is nor good, nor wise.
4.
He mischeife on his bed contrives,
By ways abhorred thrives.
5.
Up to the clouds Thy mercies reach;
The hills Thy justice teach.
6.
Thy judgments (Lord,) who all do keep,
Are like th'un-fathom'd deep.
7.
How does Thy love excel! Thy wing
Mankind ore-shadowing.
8.
Thy house to them full plenty brings,
Who drink of Thy pure springs.
9.
Thou have life's springs, and in Thy sight
We shall behold the light.
10.
Thy kindness, (Lord) and grace impart
To the upright in heart.
11.
Let not the foot of pride prevail,
Nor wicked hands assail.
12.
Down are they fallen who ills devise;
And never shall arise.
PSALM. XXXVII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1
FRet not thy self, nor envious be
At those that work iniquity.
2.
For they shall soon to nothing pass,
Cut down and withered like the grass.
3.
Trust in the Lord, be doing good;
So shall thou dwelling have, and food.
4.
Delight in Him, and for thy hire,
He give thee will thy hearts desire.
5.
Commit thy self to his sole care,
By whom our actions crowned are.
6.
Thine innocence He Will bring to light,
Clear as the day, or noontide bright.
7.
Rest then on Him, nor against those fret,
Whose wicked projects prosper yet.
8.
And cease from wrath; least anger may
To greater evils thee betray.
9.
For wicked ones are cut away;
But good men long on earth shall stay.
10.
The Sinners vanish in short space:
Though sought, thou shall not find their place.
11.
Yet shall the meek unshaken stand,
Inheriting the promised land:
Their blessings here on earth increase,
With plenty crowned, and lasting peace.
12.
Ill men with fury, and despite,
By plots would circumvent th'upright.
13.
But God shall laugh, and them defy;
Whose veng full day is coming nigh.
14.
Their sword is draw'n, their bow is bent,
To slay the just, is their intent.
15.
But by their sword themselves shall die;
And all their bows shall broken ly.
16.
A good man's lot, though small, is more
Then wicked rich men's wealthy store.
17.
Destruction shall their arms enfold;
But God the righteous does uphold.
18.
The Lord accounts the just men's age,
And will prolong their heritage;
19.
In evil times not shamed, nor grieved;
In days of famine still relieved.
20.
But Gods enraged enemies
Shall vanish as the Smoakes that rise;
Dissolved, and melted into fume,
As does the fat of Lambs consume.
21.
The wicked borrow, but not pay;
The good both lend, and give away.
22.
Such as be blessed, possess the land;
The bad cut off, and cursed stand.
Second Part.
23.
A good man's steps God orders right,
Who does in His commands delight.
24.
Though fallen, he shall rise again;
For God's right hand does him sustain.
25.
I have been young, and now am old;
Yet never did my eyes behold
The just forsaken, or unfed;
Or see his children beg their bread.
26.
He mercy shows, and lends in need;
And ever blessed is his seed.
27.
Depart from evil, and do well;
That you with Him may ever dwell.
28.
God judgment loves, His Saints not leaves;
But sinners of their race bereaves.
29.
The just His promised land possess,
And dwell in endless Happiness.
30.
In judgment, and discourses wise
A righteous mouth will exercise.
31.
Gods Law does in his heart abide,
Nor shall his goings ever slide.
32.
Though wicked persons daily wait,
To shed his blood confederate;
33.
God lets him not condemned ly,
Or by a wrongful sentence die.
34.
Wait on the Lord, and keep His way;
That He to life exalt thee may:
When thou the wicked men shall see
Cut off, and quite extinguished be.
35.
I in great power have ill ones seen,
Like spreading Lawrells fresh and green:
36.
Yet passed he by, and soon was gone;
Not found again, nor thought upon.
37.
Mark the upright, the just intend;
For such a man in peace shall end.
38.
But sinners, to destruction cast,
Are in their death cut off at last.
39.
God to the righteous help does raise;
He is their strength in troubled days.
His aid shall save them from the unjust;
Because in Him they plant their trust.
PSALM. XXXVIII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
LOrd! let me not in anger wast,
Nor Thy rebukes in fury taste.
2.
Thy piercing arrows deeply wound;
Thy pressing hand does me confound.
3.
My sickly body finds no ease,
Because my sin does Thee displease.
Nor will that guilt Thou do detest
Afford my troubled conscience rest.
4.
My sins, like to a torrent grow'n,
My sinking head have overflow'n.
They burden me with care, and fear;
And are become too great to bear.
5.
My sores, and wounds corrupted smell,
My foul offense, and folly tell:
6.
Bowed down with trouble, and forlorn,
By night I wake, by day I mourn.
7.
My loins diseased, my flesh unsound;
And all my body seems one wound.
8.
I feeble am, with anguish broake,
And roar beneath They heavy stroke.
9.
O Lord, Thou know my whole desire;
My hidden groans to Thee aspire.
10.
My heart does pant, my vigor dies;
Of light deprived are mine eyes.
11.
My friends, who late professed love,
Far from my sore themselves remove.
My kindred my converses shun;
Nor come to comfort, but look on.
12.
They, who my life seek to ensnare,
Intent upon my mischiefs are.
With foul reproaches, and false lies,
My ruin daily they devise.
13.
But I, as those nor hear, nor speak,
Did never into passion break:
14.
No angry murmur from me fell,
Which might my griefs impatience tell.
15.
For I in Thee my trust repose,
To hear my moan, and quell my foes.
16.
Who, when my foot amiss did go,
Triumphed at my overthrow.
17.
With woes oppressed I daily fall,
My sorrows are continual:
And whilst my faults are in my view,
They do as often my pain renew.
18.
I therefore will those sins confess,
And with contrition beg redress.
I will the guilt of my offense
Wash off with tears of penitence.
19.
O Lord! mine enemies are strong,
And live to do me further wrong.
Each day their number does increase,
Who are the haters of my peace.
20.
They also have against me stood,
Who make returns of ill for good:
Yet know no cause for their despite,
But that I follow what is right.
21.
Therefore my sad request I make,
That Thou will never me forsake.
My God! O never far depart,
Who my releife, and comfort art.
22.
My sighs, and sorrows look upon,
Thou God of my salvation:
Afford thy help in time of need,
And to my reskue come with speed.
PSALM. XXXIX.
1.
I Said my ways I will intend,
And least my tongue offend,
My mouth shall bownd and bridled be,
Whilst I the wicked see.
2.
I dumb awhile and silent stood,
Even ceasing to speak good;
Until at last my grieved heart
Was urged with sorrows smart:
3.
So that my heated breast became
For lack of vent a flame;
And then my tongue these words expressed,
Breathed forth from my disrest.
4.
Lord! Let me understand my end,
How far my days extend;
That I may know how I am frail,
Each moment apt to fail.
5.
Behold Thou made the days of man
No longer then a span:
His age as nothing is, and he
At best but vanity:
6.
Man like a shadow walks in vain,
Wasting his time with pain;
He heaps up riches, yet not knows
What heir shall them dispose.
7.
And now O Lord! on whom shall I
Whilst I stay here rely?
Truly my hope shall wait on Thee,
My joys there treasured be.
8.
Deliver me when I transgress,
And help me in distress;
Let not the foolish me deride,
Or scorn me in their pride.
9.
Under Thy scourge I silent lay
Prepared to obey:
I did not murmur at my pain,
Or of Thy hand complain.
10.
Yet now Thy mercies I invoke,
To take away Thy stroke;
For I consume, and my faint breath
Is yielding up to death.
11.
When Thou for sin do man correct,
Rebuking his neglect,
Thou make his beauty soon consume
Like to the wandering fume.
Sickness destroys him, as a moath
Corrodes and frets the cloth.
So vain is man, and quickly gone
Into corruption.
12.
Lord hear my cry! let not thine ears
Be deaf unto my tears:
For I with Thee a stranger am,
And but to sojourne came.
13.
O spare my time a little length,
Till I recover strength,
Before I go from this worlds shore,
And shall be seen no more.
PSALM. XL.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
I Patient did for God attend,
Who to my cry His ear did lend:
2.
From horror's pit He did me pluck,
And miry clay wherein I stuck.
And on the rock He set my feet,
From whence my goings nere should fleet.
3.
My mouth new songs of praises fill;
That men may fear, and trust Him still.
4.
The man most happy is, and blessed,
Whose constant faith on God does rest:
And never will the proud ones prize,
Nor such as turn aside to lies.
5.
Lord! many are Thy wonders wrought,
And loving toward us is Thy thought:
If I would speak and them declare,
They more then can be numbered are.
6.
No sacrifice Thou did desire,
Nor sin^ oblation burnt in fire.
Thou pierced, and opened have mine ear;
(To show what gifts more pleasing were:)
7.
Then said I; Lo, I come: Of old
The volume of the book foretold:
8.
Lord! I to do Thy will delight;
Yea in my heart Thy Law I write.
9.
Thy righteousness my lips did teach,
Thy truth in great assemblies preach:
10.
Thy word I hid not, or concealed;
But unto men Thy love revealed.
11.
Thy tender mercies nere remove,
But still preserve me in Thy love:
12.
For more in number then my hairs
My sin-prest soul is vexed with cares.
13.
Be pleased to save, and keep me fast;
O Lord! to give me help make have.
14.
Let them confounded be with shame,
Who at my souls destruction aim.
Let them repulsed back retire,
Who wish my fall, or hurt desire.
15.
Let them be shamed, and desolate,
Who, Fie upon thee, say in hate.
16.
Let all that seek Thy glorious Name,
Their joys and comforts loud proclaim:
Let all, who Thy salvation love,
Say always, Praised be God above.
17.
Though poor, and needy I am brought,
Thou not exclud'st me from Thy thought*
Thou my redeemer art, and stay;
My God! O make no long delay.
PSALM. XLI.
Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandments.
1.
BLessed is he, the poor who minds;
He help from God in trouble finds.
2.
The Lord preserves, and life supplies,
Nor gives him up to enemies.
3.
When languishing upon his bed,
By God he shall be strengthened:
By Thee, when weak and lowest laid,
His bed is in his sickness made.
4.
I said, my soul in mercy save;
For, (Lord,) against Thee I sinned have.
5.
My foes thus speak: When shall he die?
And loose both Name, and Memory?
6.
Even those, to see me who resort,
When gone, traduce me in report.
7.
My haters whisper, and devise
To hurt me in their calumnies.
8.
Sick of a foul disease he lies,
(Say they,) and never more shall rise:
9.
Yea my near friend, who eat my bread,
Lifts up his heel to spurn my head.
10.
Lord! raise me from this woeful plight,
That I their malice may requite.
11.
I shall in this Thy favor know,
If not triumphed by my foe.
12.
Thou do my innocence sustain,
And in Thy presence me retain.
13.
Blessed be the God of Jacob then
Through all enduring times: Amen.
PSALM. XLII.
1.
AS the chased Heart distressed with heat,
Flies to the Brooks retreat:
O God! my soul pursued, and faint,
So after Thee does pant.
2.
My soul, to care and sorrow cursed,
For God does hourly thirst.
When shall I come Thy presence near,
And in Thy sight appear?
3.
But tears, which day and night did fall,
I had no meat at all:
While they, where is thy God do cry,
On whom thou do rely?
4.
Remembering this, my soul I power,
And those glad times deplore,
When to Thy house we thronged with praise,
To keep Thy Holy days.
5.
Why, O my soul, art thou perplexed?
My heart cast down and vexed?
Hope thou in God, and praise Him still,
Whose help up-raise thee will.
6.
O God, my soul cast down with grief,
Within finds no releife.
But Jordans Land, and Hermon hill
I will remember still.
7.
One deep upon another calls,
At Thy loud Water-falls:
Thy waves, and billows highest run,
All over me have gone.
8.
The Lord yet sends His favors ray;
To shine on me by day:
And I my songs and Prayers all night
Send to the God of light.
9.
To God I Will say, My Rock, and strength!
Am I forgot at length?
Before my foes why do I mourn,
Oppressed, and forlorn?
10.
At their reproach, with scoffing mixed,
I am with swords trans-fixt:
Whilst flouting at my misery,
Where is Thy God? they cry.
11.
Why, O my soul, art thou perplexed?
My heart cast down, and vexed?
Hope thou in God, and praise Him still;
Whose help up-raise thee will.
PSALM. XLIII.
1.
Judge me (O Lord) and plead my cause
With them that know no Laws.
Deliver me from the unjust,
In fraud and wrong that trust.
2.
Thou (God!) can only me protect:
Why do Thou me reject?
Why go I thus in mourning dressed,
By enemies oppressed?
3.
O send Thy Glorious beams of light,
Thy truth to keep me right?
That of Thy holy dwellings I
May make discovery.
4.
Then will I to Thy altar bring
A joyful offering:
And on the harp my ditties raise,
To celebrate Thy praise.
5.
Why droop'st thou then, my Soul, so fast,
Down in thy sorrows cast?
Or wherefore, my afflicted heart,
Thou so disturbed art?
6.
Trust in the Lord: for I will praise,
And thank Him, all my days.
Who cures, and crowns life's short annoyes
With never ending joys.
PSALM. XLIV.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
O God! our fathers have us told,
What Thou have done in times of old.
2.
Thou drav'st out Nations by Thine hand,
To plant Thy people in their land.
3.
'Twas not their arm, or sword, which got
Those fair possessions for their lot:
But thy right hand, thine arm of might,
Because in them Thou took'st delight.
4.
O glorious God! Thou art my King:
Deliverance to Jacob bring.
5.
Through Thee we will our enemies,
And those tread down, who against us rise.
6.
For in my bow I will not trust;
It Is not my sword deliver must:
7.
But Thou have saved us by Thy Name,
And all that hate us put to shame.
8.
In God all day we make our boasts,
And praise Thy Name, great Lord of hoasts!
9.
But Thou have left and cast us low,
Nor with our Armies forth do go.
10.
Thou make us our backs to turn;
Whilst they, which hate us, spoil and burn.
11.
Thou gav'st us to the Heathens power,
Like sheep, to scatter and devour.
12.
Thou do Thy People sell for naught,
Not richer, when the price is brought:
13.
Thou make us our neighbors scorn,
Laughed at, and with reproaches torn:
14.
We are a byword all about;
The Heathen shake their head, and flowt.
15.
I ly confounded with disgrace,
And shame has covered my face.
16.
By reason of their vengfull pride,
Who Thee blaspheme, and me deride;
17.
All this we bear: yet have we not
Thy self, or Covenant forgot.
18.
Our heart revolting turns not back,
Nor do our feet Thy ways forsake;
19.
Though amongst the dragons broken sore,
And with death's shadow covered ore.
20.
If we our God forgotten have;
Or unto Idols worship gave:
21.
Shall not his search the sin impart,
Who knows the secrets of each heart?
22.
Yea for Thy sake so ill we fare,
We all the day-long killed are:
Counted as sheep for shambles bred,
Fit only to be slaughtered.
23.
Awake (O Lord!) why do Thou sleep?
Still will Thou us at distance keep?
24.
Why hidest Thou Thy face from those,
Who ly oppressed, and grieved by foes?
25.
Our soul unto the dust is throw'n,
To earth our belly cleaves down.
26.
Arise, our life from ruin take;
And save us for Thy mercies sake.
PSALM. XLV.
1.
MY heart good matter does indite,
Which of the King I write.
And like a ready pen, my tongue
Frames her triumphant song.
2.
Thou fairer art then humane race;
Thy lips are full of grace.
Therefore thy God on thee does power
His blessings endless store.
3.
Gird on thy sword, O great in might!
For Truth, and Justice fight.
4.
That all the world may understand
The terror of Thy hand.
5.
Thy sharp'ned arrows wound all those,
Who dare the King oppose:
Whereby subdued at Thy call,
The vanquished people fall.
6.
Thy throne, O God, does still endure;
Thy Scepter just, and pure:
7.
Thou righteousness do value best,
And wickedness detest.
Therefore thy God has Thee preferred,
And by a love unheard,
The oil of gladness on Thy head,
Above Thy fellows, shed.
8.
Myrrh, Aloes, and Cassia's smell
Upon Thy garments dwell,
Out of the Ivory Palaces
Provided Thee to please.
9.
King's daughters were amongst Thy train;
Nor to attend disdain,
The Queen, upon Thy right hand placed,
With gold of Ophir graced.
10.
Hearken O Daughter, and give ear:
Forget thy parents dear:
11.
The King shall prize thy beauty more;
Whom, as thy Lord, adore.
12.
Rich Tire with gifts and presents great
Thy favor shall entreat.
13.
Who, far above Thy beauties seen,
All glorious art within.
14.
She in a robe with needles wrought,
Shall to the King be brought.
The Virgins which upon her wait,
Shall add unto Thy State.
15.
With joy and gladness they resort,
To enter the Kings Court:
16.
Thou shall have sons, in Father's stead;
And many Princes breed.
17.
In all succeeding times Thy Name
Shall mentioned be with fame;
Whilst the glad people Thy renown
With endless praises crown.
PSALM. XLVI.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
GOd is our refuge; our defense
Rests wholly on His providence:
Which still affords a present aid,
When greatest troubles us invade.
2.
Therefore we shall not need to fear,
Though the fixed earth removed were:
Or though the hills, and mountains steep
Lay buried in the angry Deep.
3.
Although the roaring waters make
The Mountains with their swelling shake;
4.
Yet calmer rivers do embrace
Gods City, His fair dwelling place.
5.
Whose Tabernacles, by His love,
Are kept that they can never move.
For He, when dangers Her distress,
His early succor shall address.
6.
The Nations rage; the Kingdoms are
Disturbed with strife, and threats of war.
But He the tempest can allay,
And cause the earth to melt away.
7.
The Lord of Hosts does us direct;
Great Jacobs God does us protect:
8.
Come see, on those our mischeifs wrought,
What desolations He has brought.
9.
He makes strife, and wars to cease;
And crowns the bleeding earth with peace:
He breaks the bow, and crackes the spear;
In fire the Chariots burned were.
10.
Lo, this is God, whose awful sway
Both earth, and Heaven must obey.
11.
The Lord of Hosts does us direct;
Great Jacobs God does us protect.
PSALM. XLVII.
1.
O Clap your hands, All earth throughout
To God in triumph shout.
2.
His greatness rules the world from high,
With awful Majesty.
3.
He Nations under us subdues;
And will our portion choose;
Which does in glory far excel;
The Lot of Israel.
5.
God is gone up with showting voice,
And sounding trumpets noise.
6.
Unto our God loud praises sing;
Sing praises to our King.
7.
To Him, whose power the earth does fill,
With knowledge sing, and skill:
8.
Who on His sacred throne remains,
And ore the Heathen reigns.
9.
The Princes with the People join,
Sprung out of Abra'm's loyne.
For all are in His care enrolled,
Who highly is extolled.
PSALM. XLVIII.
1.
GReat is the Lord His praise is great,
In Salem His blessed seat.
2.
Mount Sion beauteous is for site,
The spacious earth's delight.
Upon the sides which Northward rise,
The Great King's City lies.
3.
God in her Palaces alone
Is for a refuge known.
4.
For lo, the Kings assembled were,
Her glories down to tear:
5.
They saw with marvail her defense,
In trouble hasting thence.
6.
They were surpised with sudden fear,
Like pangs which women bear.
7.
Thou break'st the Ships from Tarshish sail
With Thy strong Eastern gale.
8.
In Salem, unto God endeared,
We saw, what often we heard:
The Lord of Hosts will her defend,
And stablish to the end.
9.
Lord in Thy Temple to our thought
We have Thy mercies brought.
10.
O God, according to Thy Name,
So endless is Thy fame.
Thy hand is full of righteousness.
Let Sion joy express.
11.
Let Judah's daughter gladly sing
The judgments of their King.
12.
Walk round about fair Sions Mount;
Her stately Towers recount;
13.
Her Bulwarks mark, and structures well,
And to your Children tell.
14.
For here the Lord our God intends,
Till time expired ends,
His favors on This place to breath,
And guide us unto death.
PSALM. XLIX.
As Psalm 51.
1.
ALl people of the world give ear;
2.
Low, high, rich, poor, together hear!
3.
My mouth of wisdom shall dilate;
My heart deep knowledge meditate.
4.
To Parables I will incline,
Dark sayings on the harp divine.
5.
Why should my end affrightment feel,
When sin, or death assault my heel?
6.
Who trust in wealth, and riches boast,
7.
Cannot redeem a brother lost;
Or bring back life, when fled away;
Or unto God his ransom pay;
8.
(The soul so precious is, no rate
Can it recall, or expiate:)
9.
That so he might for ever last,
And not of earth's corruption taste.
10.
For he perceives that the wise,
Like to the fool, and brutish dies:
And all the wealth, which they have got,
Must then become another lot.
11.
Yet they suppose their dwelling place
Shall last through each succeeding race;
And to their lands their names bequeath,
To keep them living after death.
12.
Man nerethelesse to honor brought,
Like beasts that perish, comes to naught.
13.
Thus their vain folly ends; yet they,
Who them survive, praise all they say.
14.
Like sheep, they in the grave are laid,
For death to feed on, dishes made.
The just in light eternal reigns,
Whilst others pomp in dust remains.
15.
But God my my soul shall take, and save
From power of the wide-mouthed grave.
16.
Be not thou troubled, or afraid,
When one of these is wealthy made:
Or when with plenty filled, and ease,
His houses glory does increase.
17.
He carries nothing when he dies,
But stripped of all his honor lies.
18.
Though living, he his soul did bless;
Applauding his false happiness:
And men that course in worldings praise,
Which most the appetite obaies.
19.
He with his fathers ends in night,
And never more shall see the light.
20.
Man, who in honor nothing knows,
From hence, like beasts that perish, goes.
PSALM. L.
To the proper Tune.
1.
THe God of might,
Unto the earth did call,
From the Suns light
To his declining fall.
2.
From Sion fair
The Lord himself has shone,
3.
God shall repair,
In noise and terror known*
Ushered with Flame
Wrapped in a stormy cloud,
4.
He shall proclaim
To earth his judgment loud.
5.
My Saints collect
To me with offerings sworn;
6.
Heavens shall detect
The justice by Him borne.
7.
My people hear,
O Israel, I speak,
And witness bear
Against thee, my Laws do break.
8.
I not reprove
Thy sacrifices fail,
9.
No goats I love,
Nor Bullocks from thy stall.
10.
Mine is each beast
Which the wild Forests feed,
Even to the least
Which thousand hills do breed:
11.
The fowls I know
Which on the Mountains fly,
The wild beasts owe
Which in the desert ly.
12.
If I would eat,
I need not tell it thee;
The whole worlds meat,
And it, belongs to me.
13.
That I require
Bulls flesh, why should thou think,
Burnt in the fire?
Or blood of goats would drink?
14.
Thanksgivings bring,
And pay to God thy vows;
This offering
He as the best allows:
15.
And on Me call
In thine afflicted days,
I save thee shall,
And thou shall give Me praise.
16.
But to the bad
(Says God) why should you dare,
The Laws I made,
Or Statutes to declare?
Why do ye vaunt
In your un-hallow'd mouth,
My Covenant?
17.
Whose hearts instruction loath.
18.
Thou did consent
When thou a thief had seen:
Thy foul intent
Has with adult'rers been.
19.
Thou to all ill
Thy mouth do dedicate,
Thy false tongue still
Is uttering deceit:
20.
Thou do back-bite,
To work thy brothers shame,
And full of spite
Thy Mothers son defame.
21.
This have thou done,
And whilst I silent sat,
Thou thought Me one
Who had, like thee, forgate.
But I will have,
And ordered before thine eyes
Present at last
All these impieties.
22.
Consider ye!
Who God, nor judgment fear,
Least angered He
Your souls in pieces tear.
23.
Who offers praise,
Me honors; and the upright,
After earthes days,
Shall dwell in endless light.
PSALM. LI.
To the proper Tune.
1.
HAve mercy, O my God! on me
Who thus dejected fly to Thee:
According to Thy boundless love
The weight of mine offense remove.
2.
From Thine un-wasted pitties spring
Thy wonted streams of pardon bring.
O wash my leprous soul again,
And cleanse me from this bloody stain.
3.
In sad repentance I confess
The knowledge of this wickedness:
4.
Against Thee have I sinned alone,
Who art my Judge, for what is done.
I cannot hide the blood I spilt,
Nor will excuse my secret guilt.
That at Thy bar when I am tried,
Thy sentence might be justified.
5.
Brought forth I was to Parents scorn,
In sin conceived, with sorrow Borne;
And have improved, by act and thought,
Those spots which to the world I brought.
6.
But Thou do inward truth require,
And only can that grace inspire:
Thou therefore shall, who wisdom art,
With understanding fill my heart.
7.
Purge me with Hyssop, then my soul
Shall cleansed be, though never so foul.
Wash me, and my black crimes will grow
More white, then is the falling snow.
8.
Make me to hear Thy mercies voice,
So shall my broken bones rejoice.
9.
Turn from my sins Thy face away,
Nor let them in remembrance stay.
10.
Create (O God!) a cleansed heart,
Renew my soul, chaste thoughts impart:
11.
Me from Thy presence never drive,
Nor of thy guiding grace deprive.
12.
Restore Thy comfort yet at last,
And let Thy spirit keep me fast:
13.
Then wicked men thy ways I Will teach,
And sinners shall conversion reach.
14.
Deliver me from guilt of blood,
O God Thou Author of my good.
15.
Open my lips, enlarge my tongue;
And then thy praises shall be sung.
16.
Thou do not sacrifice desire,
Or any offering made by fire.
17.
The sacrifices God delight,
Are broken hearts, and souls contrite.
18.
O cast thy favorable eye
On Sions low calamity:
Build up negl^cted Salems wall,
Whose Structures now to ruin fall.
19.
Then shall Thou be, when once appeased,
With our devout oblations pleased:
Who heaps of Incense up will fling,
And bullocks to Thine Altar bring.
PSALM. LII.
1.
WHy boasting Tyrant do thou threat,
Thou can do mischeife yet?
Gods constant goodness will prevent
Thy murtherous intent.
2.
Thy tongue suggestions does devise;
Like rasors cut thy Iyes.
3.
Thou evil more then goodness love;
Deceit, not truth, approv'st.
4.
Thy words, false tongue, men's lives devour:
But God shall, by His power,
5.
Pluck thee from earth thy dwelling place;
Thy name from heaven raze.
6.
The just these judgments see, and fear,
Which wicked ones must bear:
And all their malice vainly tried
With laughter shall deride.
7.
Lo, this is he who God not chose
For his assured repose:
But strong in violence, and stealth,
Relied upon his wealth.
8.
Yet I within God's house shall be
Like a green Olive tree:
And on Thy mercy all my days
My confidence will raise.
9.
I for this preservation will
My praises offer still;
And on Thy saving Name await,
Which Saints must celebrate.
PSALM. LIII.
1.
THe fool, whose heart does truth upbraid,
There is no God, has said.
Corrupted is with sin their mind;
And none to good inclined.
2.
God His survay from Heaven took,
And down on men did look;
To see, if any Him would know,
Or seek His truth below.
3.
But now revolted every one
To filthiness is gone:
His Law by none is understood;
There is not one does good.
4.
Will they all knowledge thus defy,
That work iniquity?
Who eat my people up as bread;
Nor God have worshipped.
5.
He by false fear, and vain affright,
Their bones has scattered quite.
Through Gods just vengeance, and despise,
In shame their glory lies.
6.
O that from Sion help were sent,
To end our banishment!
For Jacobs Offspring then in peace
Should joy in their release.
PSALM. LIVE.
1.
SAve me (O God,) and by Thy might,
With judgment do me right.
Be Thou to my request attent,
2.
My words in sorrow sent.
3.
For against my soul Oppressors rise;
Strangers, who thee despise.
4.
But thou my help, and champion art,
For those that take my part.
5.
With sure revenge. He shall repay,
And cut my foes away.
6.
Free offerings then to thee shall flame;
And I will praise Thy Name.
7.
His goodness me from trouble saves,
And gives them timelesse graves.
Mine eye on those sees his desire,
Who did my fall conspire.
PSALM. LV.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
GIve ear (O God) unto my prayer,
From my request not hidden far.
2.
Attend to me with crying faint,
Who lowdly mourn in my complaint.
3.
Because my foes injurious voice
Mine innocence decryes with noise;
And bad oppressors That impute,
Which does their wrath and hatred suit.
4.
My heart within me, sore with pain,
Death's falling terrors does sustain;
5.
Cold fear and trembling me dismayed:
Orewhelm'd with horror, thus I said:
6.
O that I were with wings possessed,
Like doves to fly, and be at rest:
7.
Lo, then far off I wander might,
And to the desert take my flight.
8.
I from the windy storm would have,
And this fierce tempest 'scape at last.
9.
Destroy, (O Lord!) their tongues divide:
For in the City strife I spied.
10.
Both day and night the walls they round,
Wherein all mischeifes do abound:
11.
In midst whereof foul sins do meet,
Deceit and guile in every street.
12.
No open foe did me traduce;
For then I could have borne the abuse:
No public hate against me revealed;
Then should I have my self concealed.
13.
But it was Thou, my friend, my guide,
In equal conversation tried.
14.
We in sweet counsel days had spent,
And to Gods house together went.
15.
O let some unexpected death,
Strange, as unlook't for, seize their breath.
Let them go down alive to hell;
For wickedness with them does dwell.
16.
But I upon the Lord will call,
Who saves me from their plotted fall.
17.
At evening, morning, and midday
To Him that hears me will I pray.
18.
He resku'd has in peace my life;
Delivered from their bloody strife
Who were in battle opposite:
For many then for me did fight.
19.
Afflictions shall on them lay hold,
By God imposed, who 'bides of old.
Because they in no changes were,
They grow secure, and God not fear.
20.
He has put forth his hand against These
Who were enleagu'd with him in peace:
His friendly vow he did recant,
And break his solemn Covenant.
21.
His speeches smooth as butter are;
But in his heart is cruel war:
More soft then Oil his flattering words;
Yet were they sharper then draw'n swords.
22.
Upon the Lord thy burden cast;
Who shall sustain, and keep thee fast.
23.
But thou (O God) shall bring them down,
In pit of wide destruction throw'n:
Men treacherous, of blood, and strife,
Shall find long troubles, and short life;
Nor half their days completed see:
But I will ever trust in Thee.
PSALM. LVI.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
BE merciful, O God! to me:
For Man combines to swallow me.
He daily does against me fight,
By Power to oppress my right.
2.
My watchful enemies each hour
My life assail and would devour.
O Thou most High! they many are,
Who have conspired in this war.
3.
Yet though encompast, and afraid,
I fly for shelter to Thy aid.
4.
For trusting in Gods word, and arm,
I know no flesh can do me harm.
5.
They still my words, and meaning wrest;
Close mischeife plotting in their breast.
6.
They join themselves, my steps they mark,
To overthrow me in the dark.
7.
Shall they escape? Lord, in thy frown
Defeat their plots, and can them down.
8.
My wandering steps, and each loose thought
Must be unto Thy Audit brought:
Thou bott'lest all the tears I shed;
My sighs are book'd, and numbered.
9.
Soon therefore as to Thee I cry,
I know my foes shall faint, and fly.
10.
God only is my trust, and joy:
11.
I fearlesse am of man's annoy.
12.
To Thee, O Lord, I Will pay my vow;
My knees in thanks to Thee shall bow.
13.
For thou my life keep'st from the grave,
And do my feet from falling save:
That with the living in Thy sight
I may enjoy Eternal light.
PSALM. LVII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
BE merciful (O God!) to me,
Whose soul does only trust in Thee.
To Thy wing's shadow will I have,
Till these calamities be past.
2.
My cry to God I will advance,
Who always sends deliverance.
3.
His mercy saves me from their power,
Who would both life, and fame devour.
4
My soul amongst Lions is untamed;
Even sons of men with hate enflamed:
Whose teeth are spears, and darts; whose word;
More piercing, and more sharp then swords.
5.
O God! above the earth, or sky,
Exalted be Thy Majesty!
6.
For my greiv'd soul they nets prepare;
But in their own pits fallen are.
7.
My heart (O God) my heart is fixed;
I Will Anthems sing with praises mixed.
8.
A wake my Glory, harp awake;
I early will addresses make.
9.
Thou amongst the Nations shall be praised,
10.
Whose mercy to the clouds is raised.
11.
O God! above the earth, or sky,
Exalted by Thy Majesty.
PSALM. LVIII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
O Congregation speak ye right?
O sons of men judge ye upright?
2.
Your hearts contain, and hands dispense
Only full weight of violence.
3.
The wicked men, to life when come,
Estranged are, even from the womb;
They go astray, though newly borne,
They utter lies with lips forsworn.
4.
Like Serpents they their poison bear;
And like deaf adders stop their ear;
5.
Which will not hear the enchanters spell,
Although he charm them nere so well.
6.
Break thou their teeth (O God) which hang
Like the young Lions Sharpened fang.
7.
Let them like melting waters ly;
And cut their arrows as they fly.
8.
Be they like snailes consumed to slime;
Or women's births before their time.
9.
Quicker then thorns enkindled blaze,
Let whirlwinds blow them from their place.
10.
This sight shall joyful make the good,
To wash their feet in wicked blood.
11.
So men shall say, from God are had
Rewards for just ones, plagues for bad.
PSALM. LIX.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
FRom enemies (O God!) defend,
2.
Whose bloody plots in murder end.
3.
Lo, for my Soul they ly in wait;
The mighty are confederate.
Yet is it not for my offense,
They thus prepare to take me hence.
4.
Awake, (O Lord) behold my wrong;
Thy help withhold not from me long.
5.
O Lord! Thou God of Hosts awake;
Of all the Heathen vengeance take:
Let not Thy grace to them extend,
Who with malicious hearts offend.
6.
Like dogs they come, when day is done,
Which snarling through the City run:
7.
Behold they belch out daring words;
And in their lips they carry swords.
For who (say they) our acts shall hear?
Or hinder us, when we appear?
8.
But Thou (O Lord) shall them deride,
And strike the heathen in their pride.
9.
O Lord! my trust awaites on Thee,
Who by Thy strength shall guarded be.
10.
Gods saving mercy me prevents;
Mine eye shall see their ill events.
11.
Disperse them (Lord, my shield!) not slay;
Least it forget my people may.
12.
Let their mouths sin themselves confound;
Themselves their lies and curses wound.
13.
Great King! consume them in thine ire;
14.
Let them like dogs at night retire,
15.
Still wandering up and down for meat;
And grudge, when lacking what to eat.
16.
But to Thy power my lips shall sing;
Yea long before the day does spring,
My thankful hymns shall sound aloud
The Mercy Thou to me have showed.
Thou art in trouble my defense,
A refuge for my innocence.
17.
To Thee O God my strength lle sing,
For Thou do help, and mercy bring.
PSALM. LX.
1
LOrd! Thou have scattered us abroad,
We have strange countries troad;
O turn, and let our wandering feet
In our own dwellings meet.
2.
The trembling earth is rent by wars,
And broke in factious jarrs:
Heal Thou the breach Thy fury makes,
For cur foundation shakes.
3.
With cares Thou have Thy people fed,
And to amazement led.
Thou minglest Thy Revenges cup,
And we have drunk it up.
4.
Yet thou thy banner have displayed,
To gather those that strayed.
Thy truth and wonted pity shall
Our banishment recall.
5.
That therefore Thy beloved may be
From all invasion free,
Thy right hand for their safety rear,
And their petitions hear.
6.
God by his Truth did often profess,
He would his servants bless.
I will divide fair Shechem's soil,
And Suecoth's valley spoil.
Manasseh, Gilead, both are mine;
In war shall Ephraim shine.
But Iudahs Scepter all must awe,
And give my people Law.
8.
Moab shall be a dunghill grow'n;
Proud Edom overthrow'n:
Philistia's boasted triumphs shall
Be buried in her fall.
9.
Who me will to the City lead,
Fierce Edoms strength, and head?
That I may break her fensed gate,
And trample on her state.
10.
O Thou my God who cast'dst us off,
And made our force their scoff,
Wilt not Thou with our armies go,
To quell the insulting foe?
11.
From trouble save us once again:
For help of man is vain.
12.
Through God we shall in battle rise,
And foil our enemies.
PSALM. LXI.
1.
GIve ear, O God! unto my cry;
My Prayer not deny;
2.
When through the earth in exile throw'n
To Thee I make my moan.
Thou to that rock of strength shall lead
My care oppressed head;
3.
Who art my shelter and defense
Against all violence.
4.
Within Thy Tabernacle I
Will dwell eternally;
Whilst my unshaken hopes endure,
Under Thy wing secure.
5.
For Thou O God have heard my vow;
Thou my desire do know:
From whom the heritages came
To those that fear Thy Name.
6.
Thou shall preserve the King in peace,
And give His years increase:
7.
That He within Thy gracious sight
May dwell in endless light.
Thy mercy, and Thy truth prepare;
Which his preservers are.
8.
So to Thy Name I Will praises sing,
And vows performed bring.
PSALM. LXII.
1.
MY soul does wait on God alone,
Whence comes salvation.
2.
He is my Rock; firm'd in His love,
I shall not greatly move.
3.
How long will mischief ye devise?
Swift death shall you surprise.
Ye shall be like a bowing wall,
Or tottering fences fall.
4.
For they consult to cast him down,
Whom God lifts to renown:
They blessings with their mouth impart,
But curses from their heart.
5.
My soul wait Thou on God alone,
My expectation.
6.
He is my Rock, my safe defense;
I shall not move from hence.
7.
In God my health and glory rest,
My strength and refuge blessed.
8.
Trust Him, ye people, and implore;
Your heart before Him power.
9.
The sons of men, both low, and high,
Are lies, and vanity:
And all alike in balance laid,
Weigh lighter then the shade.
10.
O never in oppression trust,
Nor robberies unjust.
If wealth increase, your heart nere set
Upon the gains you get.
11.
God once has spoke, and often I heard,
His power is to be feared:
12.
And that His Mercy does dispense
Each work its recompense.
PSALM. LXIII.
1.
O God, Thou art my God; to Thee
My thoughts addressed be.
And early as the rising day,
I will before Thee pray.
My thirsting soul, and longing flesh
Beg, Thou will them refresh,
In that dry land, where fruits nere grow,
Nor streams of water flow.
2.
That in Thy Sanctuary I
May see Thy Majesty;
And Thy bright glory may behold,
As I had seen of old.
3.
Thy loving kindness better is,
Then life, or earthly bliss:
My lips shall therefore praises give,
4.
And bless Thee, whilst I live.
Thus unto Thee, whose Name is feared,
My hands shall be up-reard.
5.
My soul is as with marrow cloyed;
When thus my mouth's employed.
6.
I Thee remember on my bed,
With crosses wearied:
And in the watches of the night,
Thy goodness I recite.
7.
Under the shadow of Thy wing
To Thee, my Help, I sing:
8.
My soul on Thee alone depends;
Whose Right hand me defends.
9.
But those that would my Soul enslave,
Shall sink into the grave.
10.
The killing sword their lives shall slay,
Or make them foxes prey.
11.
The King in God his joy shall bear,
With those that by Him swear:
When all the mouths of such as ly,
Stopped, and confounded die.
PSALM. LXIV.
1.
MY voice in Prayer, O God, intend;
My life from foes defend.
2.
Me from all wicked counsails shroud, swords,
And risings of the proud.
3.
Whose tongues full bent, and whet like swords
As darts, shoot bitter words:
4.
That fearlesse, and in secret they
The perfect man may slay.
5.
In mischeife they encourage each;
Of snares make private speech;
Which when in secret laid, They cry,
What eyes shall them descry?
6.
They both contrive, and practice ill,
Most diligent to kill:
Which in their heart concealed deep
Their thoughts in secret keep.
7.
But God shall with a sudden dart
Wound their malicious heart:
8.
So their own tongue betray them shall,
As causer of their fall.
Then those deride them shall, that see,
And from their vengeance flee:
9.
All men shall fear, and thence declare,
God's work these judgments are.
For wisely they consider on,
And ponder what is done.
10.
In God rejoice then shall the just,
And glory in His trust.
PSALM. LXV.
1.
THy praise (O God!) in Sion flows,
Where we perform our vows.
2.
O Thou that hear'st our prayers sum,
To Thee all flesh shall come.
3.
My misdeeds (Lord) against me prevail;
Thy mercies though nere fail:
Who our transgressions from thy sight
Remov'st, and purgest quite.
4.
Blessed is the man Thou do admit
Within Thy Courts to sit:
For with Thy Temples beauty he
Shall satisfied be.
5.
O God of our salvation! Thou Will dreadful wonders show!
Thou hope of all earth's bounds contain,
Or far dilated Maine.
6.
Whose strength the mountains sets fast,
On their foundation placed:
7.
Who does the roaring Seas assuage,
And still the People's rage.
8.
They, in earth's utmost parts that dwell,
Thy fearful tokens tell:
Thou make the outgoings of the morn,
And nights thy praise adorn.
9.
Thou waterest the earth with rain,
Then giv'st her store of grain.
Such plenty Gods full river yields
TO enrich the thirsty fields.
10.
The settled furrows, soft with showers,
Take in Thy blessings stores.
11.
Thou do the year with goodness crown,
Thy clouds drop fatness down.
12.
The barren deserts shall abound;
The hills with joy resound;
13.
The flocks be full, the pastures spring,
With corn the valleys sing.
PSALM. LXVI.
1.
MAke unto God a joyful noise;
Ye lands lift up your voice.
2.
Sing forth the honor of His Name,
Report His glorious fame.
3.
Say unto God, how wondrous are
The works Thou do prepare!
To Thee, who in great power do sit,
Shall all Thy foes submit.
4.
With Songs, and adoration shall
The earth before Thee fall.
5.
Come see His awful works, and might,
Shown in His children's sight.
6.
He turned the Sea into dry land,
Wher-on their foot did stand.
7.
He rules in power; His eye does quell
The Nations that rebel.
8.
O bless our God, so justly feared;
And cause His praise be heard:
9.
Who makes our soul in life abide,
Nor lets our feet to slide.
10.
Thou us O God have proved, and tried,
Like silver purified:
11.
Thou broughtest us into the snare;
Our loins afflicted are.
12.
Thou wicked men have suffered
To trample on our head;
We went through fire, and water past;
Yet sav'dst Thou us at last.
13.
I will into thy Temple bring
A thankful Offering.
14.
The vow, my lips in trouble made,
Devoutly shall be paid.
15.
I offer will burnt sacrifice,
Whilst clouds of Incense rise:
Rams, Goats, with Bullocks from the stall
Shall at Thy Altar fall.
16.
O come, and hear my words declare
How large Gods favors are;
17.
When with my mouth on Him I called,
And with my tongue extolled.
18.
If wickedness my heart regard,
I shall not then be heard.
19.
But God inclined has his ear,
My prayers voice to hear.
20.
Let God for evermore be blessed,
Who granted my request:
Who has not turned away His face,
Nor held from me His grace.
PSALM. LXVII.
1.
THy mercy (Lord!) extend,
And blessings on us send;
O let Thy Light and Face Divine,
Upon They servants shine.
2.
That through the earth Thy way
Be known to Gentiles may;
And nations of the Universe
Thy saving health rehearse.
3
Let all the people raise
Their voice to sing Thy praise.
O God! let them with joy express
To Thee their thankfulness.
4.
O let the Nations sing
With gladness to their King:
For thou the world shall judge with right,
And rule the earth with might.
5.
Let all the people raise
Their voice to sing Thy praise;
O God, let them with joy express
To Thee their thankfulness.
6.
Then shall the earth increase
In plenty, and in peace:
And God, our God, in blessings shown,
Shall us His people own.
7.
God, who does ever live,
To us shall blessings give.
That all the ends of earth may fear,
And duty to Him bear.
PSALM. LXVIII.
1.
LEt God (the God of might) arise;
And scattered be His enemies.
And let all those that hate Him, flee
2.
As smoke, by winds we driven see.
So perish wicked men like fumes;
Or melted wax, which fire consumes.
3.
But let the righteous rejoice;
And unto God lift up their voice.
4.
Sing unto God, sing praises loud
To Him that rides upon the cloud.
The Name of great Jehovah bless,
5.
A father of the fatherless;
For he relieves the widows wants;
6.
He solitary households plants:
And frees the Captives from their chain;
Whilst rebels are with hunger slain.
7.
When (Lord) Thy people Thou did lead,
And marches through the desert tread,
8.
The Heavens melted, the earth shook,
And Sinai was with terror struck.
9.
Yet Thou upon thy Lot did power,
When faint and weary, plenties store:
10.
Thy congregation Thou did feed;
Reliev'dst the poor, and help'dst their need.
11.
The Lord Himself did give the word,
And numerous preachers it record.
12.
Kings armies fled, and took the foil,
Whilst women did divide the spoil.
13.
Though then ye have neglected ly'n,
Ye shall again with luster shine;
Like to the doves fair plumed wing,
As Gold, or Silver glistering.
14.
When God great Kings had put to flight,
The land was like to Salmon white.
15.
God's Mount is as fair Bashans hill,
Whose height does earth with wonder fill.
16.
Why leap ye hills which so excel?
This is the hill where God will dwell.
17.
His Chariots twenty thousand are;
Thousands of Angels serve His war.
Second Part.
18
Thou have ascended up on high,
And captive led captivity:
Did ransom those who did rebel;
That God might still among them dwell.
19.
Blessed be the Lord, the God of health,
Who loads us daily with His wealth.
20
He is the God, whose saving breath
The issues does command from death.
21.
But God shall wound their hateful head,
Who wilfully in sins are led.
22.
He said, I will my people keep,
From Bashan bring, and through the deep.
23.
That so Thy foot (borne through the cries
Of fallen, and dying enemies,)
May dipped be in slaughters flood;
And tongues of dogs lick up their blood.
24.
How Thou, (my God and King,) we know,
Did in Thy Sanctuary go:
25.
Singers lead to the Instrument,
Then Damsels with their Timbrels went.
26.
Bless God all ye from Jacob spring:
27.
Small Benjamin their Ruler bring.
With Princely Judah on the Throne,
Strong Nepthali, and Zebulen.
28.
Thy God for thee did strength command:
O let Thy work confirmed stand.
29.
Then presents shall by Kings to Thee
In Salems Temple offered be.
30.
Rebuke the peoples brutish spite;
Those scatter, who in war delight.
31.
So Egypts Princes, and the Moore,
With hands stretched out shall thee adore.
32.
Earth's Kingdoms sing, and praise ascribe
To God, who 'bove the Heavens does ride.
His mighty voice He out does send:
34.
His strength excells, the clouds to rend.
35.
O God, Thou from thy Holy Place
With terror do thy foes amaze.
He strength and power to Israel gives:
Blessed be God, who ever lives.
PSALM. LXIX.
1.
SAve me O God, for on my soul
The furious waters roll:
2.
Sunk deep in mire, no stay I have,
Orewhelm'd by every wave.
3.
I weary am of my long cry;
My throat is hoarse, and dry.
My failing eyes their strength abate,
Whilst for my God I wait.
4.
My haters without cause exceed
The hairs upon my head:
And though I things not took restore,
They wrong, and hate me more.
5.
O God! my folly Thou have known;
My sins to Thee are show'n.
6.
Let none that seek, or wait for Thee,
Through me confounded be.
7.
For Thy sake have I borne disgrace,
Shame covered has my face:
8.
A stranger to my brethren am,
Who from my Mother came.
9.
I in Thy Houses zeal do pine,
Thy wrongs reputing mine.
10.
Yet when I fasted, wept, and mourned,
That my reproach was turned.
11.
For garments I have Sackcloth worn;
A Proverb grow'n of scorn:
12.
Reviled by those the gate that throng,
And made the drunkards song.
13.
But (Lord) to Thee my prayers climb,
In Thy accepted time:
O for Thy Truth, and mercies sake,
Hear those requests I make.
14.
Deliver me from out the mire,
Where envious floods conspire;
15.
To swallowing deeps me nere expose,
Nor let the pit enclose.
16.
Give ear (O Lord) as Thou art kind,
Let me Thy mercy find:
17.
Hide not Thy Face in time of need;
But hear my moan with speed.
Second Part.
18.
Draw nigh (O Lord,) my soul redeem,
Lost in my foes esteem.
19.
Thou my dishonor know, and shame,
And those who me defame.
20.
Reproach my heavy heart has broke,
Pressed down with sorrows stroke.
For pity I, and comfort look,
But friends have me forsook.
21.
For drink, they Vinegar, for meat,
They gave me Gall to eat:
22.
O let their table prove their snare,
Their peace turn to despair.
23.
Their eyes be dark'ned; and still make
Their loins through terror shake.
24.
Upon their heads Thy fury power;
Let vengeance them devour.
25.
Make desolate their dwelling place;
Their habitation raze.
26.
For they, whom Thou have smote, pursue;
The woundeds grief renew.
27.
Add sin to their iniquity;
Let them thy presence fly:
28.
Blot from the Book of life their soul,
Nor with thy Saints enroll.
29.
But I am poor, and full of pain;
O raise me up again:
30.
So in my Song I Will praise thy Name,
And thankful ditties frame.
31.
Such gifts, and sacrifice, as these,
Will God much better please,
Then fatted Oxen from the stall,
Which on His Alter fall.
32.
The meek shall see this, and be glad,
whose hopes on God are stayed.
33.
For he will hear the poor man's cries,
His prisoners not despise.
34.
Let Heaven praise Him, Seas, and earth,
With all in them have birth.
35.
For God will Sions Cities bless,
For Judah to possess.
36.
His servants, and succeeding race
Inherit shall this place.
And those, that love His glorious Name,
For ever there remain.
PSALM. LXX.
1.
MAke have O God my life to save,
Thy speedy help I crave.
2.
Their practices with shame confound,
That seek my soul to wound.
Let them disgraced all retire,
That do my hurt desire:
3.
Who against me say, Aha, in scorn,
To shameful ruin turn.
4.
And let all those that seek to Thee,
Rejoice and gladded be.
Let them, who in thy love confide,
Say, God be magnified.
5.
But I am poor, and pressed with need;
O God, to me make speed:
Thou art my help, and only stay;
O Lord, make no delay.
PSALM. LXXI.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
IN thee (O God) my trust I place;
Confound me never with disgrace:
2.
Thou in Thy justice set me free,
Incline Thine ear, and succor me.
3.
Be Thou my strong and safe resort,
Who art my Rock, and only Fort.
4.
O Save me from unrighteous bands,
From cruel men, and bloody hands.
5.
Thou art my hope, O God of truth;
My trust and Comfort from my youth:
6.
Thou from the womb did me sustain,
When brought forth in my Mothers pain,
Thou from her bowels did me bring;
Of Thee my praise shall ever sing:
7.
And though men's wonder I am made,
My strong defense on Thee is laid.
8.
O let my mouth be filled with praise,
And with Thy honor all my days:
9.
Cast me not off, when old and frail;
Nor me forsake when strength does fail.
10.
Mine enemies combine with hate,
And for my Soul lay daily wait:
11.
Saying, Him persecute and take,
For God and man does him forsake.
12.
O be not far from me at need;
My God, to succor me make speed:
13.
Consume all those, and them confound,
Who seek my Soul with hate to wound.
Reproach them who conspire my hurt,
And my affliction make their Sport.
14.
So never shall my hope give ore;
But I will praise Thee more and more.
15.
My mouth shall still Thy mercies show,
Whose number I could never know.
16.
And in Thy strength will I go on,
Thy goodness only mention.
17.
O God, thou me from youth have taught,
To speak the wonders thou have wrought
18.
Forsake me not, when gray, and old;
Till to this Age Thy power is told.
19.
Thy righteousness, O God, exceeds:
Who equal can Thy mighty deeds?
20.
Thou who have showed me grief, and pain,
Shall quicken me (O Lord) again:
Thy hand shall bring me from the deep,
Though buried low in earth I sleep:
21.
Thou shall my greatness then increase,
And comfort me with endless peace.
22.
Therefore (O God) through all my days
On Psalteries Thy truth I Will praise:
And on the harp Thy mercies tell,
O Holy one of Israel!
23.
My joyful lips to thee shall sing;
My soul, which Thou from death did bring;
24.
My tongue Thy justice shall proclaim;
Who do my foes confound with shame.
PSALM. LXXII.
As Psalm 51.
1.
GIve (Lord) thy judgments to the King;
And from his Son let Justice spring.
2.
So shall the right to all extend,
And equity the poor defend.
3.
The mountains then shall bring forth peace,
The hills by righteousness increase.
4.
He shall the poor and needy save,
But break oppressors in the grave.
5.
All generations shall Thee fear,
So long as Sun, and Moon appear.
6
He shall, like rain on grass new mow'n,
Or showers that water earth, come down.
7.
The just shall flourish in His days;
And Peace abound, whilst light displayes.
8.
From Sea to Sea His Throne shall reach,
And from the flood to earths end stretch.
9.
They, who in deserts dwell, shall bow;
His foes, as dust His feet below.
10.
Tarshish, the Isles, with Sheba's King,
And Seba shall their presents bring.
11.
All Kings before Him shall fall down,
And every Nation serve His crown.
12.
The cries of helples He will heed,
13.
And save the souls of such as need.
14.
He shall from violence redeem,
And precious their blood esteem.
15.
Sheba shall Gold for Tribute pay;
Men praise Him still, and for Him pray.
16.
The smallest handful then of corn,
Upon the tops of Mountains borne,
Like Lebanon full fruits shall power;
The people flourish like the flower.
17.
His Name endures, whilst the Sun
About the world his course does run.
Blessings through Him descend on all;
And Nations shall Him Blessed call.
18.
Blessed be God, whose every act
His Servants wonder does attract.
19.
Blessed be His Name: Let Earth, and men
Be with His glory filled: Amen.
PSALM. LXXIII.
Sing this as Psalm 119.
1.
GOd unto Israel is kind;
To those are clean in mind.
2.
Yet had my wavering feet, and faith
Almost forsook their path.
3.
For I to envy could not cease
At fools, and sinners peace:
4.
Who not impair in ages length,
Nor lessened are in strength.
5.
They not like others troubled are,
Nor plagued with common care.
6.
They therefore are with proud disdain
Compassed, as with a chain:
And as a garment for defense,
Covered with violence.
7.
Their wanton eye with fatness swells;
And wealth their wish excells.
8.
They most corrupt oppress the weak,
And arrogantly speak.
9.
They set their mouth against heaven to talk,
Their tongue through earth does walk.
10.
Therefore Gods people, when they see,
How prosperous sinners be:
And vexed with their sorrows sense,
Incline to their defense.
11.
So words like these their passion throws;
How should we think, God knows;
12.
Who lets the wicked live in health,
And daily grow in wealth?
13.
Why virtue then should I retain?
I cleanse my heart in vain.
In vain my hands held from offense
I wash in innocence.
14.
For all the days my life has seen,
I have afflicted been;
My Soul, with wants and sorrows worn,
Was chast'ned every morn.
15.
Yet, should I not these murmurs check,
But thus disturbed speak;
I might thy Children so offend,
And Thee blaspheming end.
Second Part.
16.
But this I found by flesh and blood
Hard to be understood:
17.
Nor, till I to Thy Temple went,
Could know, what these things meant.
Then I discerned, what they portend,
And how the wicked end:
18.
Whom Thou in slippery fortunes placed
Do unto ruin cast.
19.
How are their glories, quick as thought,
To desolation brought?
They in a moment turned to tears
Consume by their own fears.
20.
God, as a dream when one awakes,
Their Image vanish makes.
Causing their late admirers eyes
Them now as much despise.
21.
Thus was my heart perplexed with pains,
And anguish pricked my reins;
22.
So foolish in my thoughts disrest
Am I, so like a beast.
23.
Yet I by Thee am still sustained,
Held up by Thy Right hand.
24.
Thy counsel here shall me direct,
Then crown with Thine Elect.
25.
Whom have I in the heavens, but Thee?
Who can my Savior be?
And through the spacious earth I none
Desire, but Thee alone.
26.
My drooping heart does daily fail,
My flesh corrupt and frail:
But Thou the strength'ner of my heart,
And lasting portion art.
27.
Who far from Thee revolting fly,
Shall perish utterly.
For Thou destroy'st, and castest low
Such as to Idols bow.
28.
But it is good, with holy fear
That I to God draw near:
To Thee my hopes entrusted are,
Who will Thy works declare.
PSALM. LXXIV.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
WHy art Thou absent (Lord) so long,
Regardlesse of Thy Servants wrong?
Or wherefore does Thy kindled ire,
Thy sheep and Pastures burn like fire?
2
O think upon Thy chosen Lot,
Nor let Mount Sion be forgot.
And may the tribe thou did redeem,
Be ever dear in Thy esteem.
3.
Lift up Thy feet, bring those to naught,
Who against Thy Church have evil wrought:
4.
Thine adversaries roar and shout,
They hang in scorn their banners out.
5.
The carved works, whose art and cost
Thy Temples building once did boast,
6.
Are into pitty'd ruin throw'n,
And with their hammers broken down.
7.
Thy Holy Place they turn to flame,
Defile the dwelling of Thy Name:
And in their wicked hearts design,
Her glories quite to undermine.
8.
With general havoc let us raze,
The Sanctuaries hallowed place.
Gods Houses thus in ashes laid,
Are woeful heaps of rubbish made.
9.
We see no Sign, nor Miracle,
No Prophet have, who can foretell:
Not one has knowledge to forecast,
How long these miseries shall last.
10.
O God! still shall the foe blaspheme,
And make Thy Name dishonours theme?
11.
Thy vengefull hand no longer hide,
But stretch it forth to strike their pride.
12.
For God is my all powerful King,
From whom earths help and safety spring.
13.
Thou did restrain the rising tide,
And with Thy strength the Sea divide.
Thou brak'st the Egyptian Dragons head,
And left'st him on the waters dead;
14.
Leviathan that sports the flood,
Thou gave for Thy peoples food.
15.
Thou from the rock made fountains flow,
And swelling Seas dry land to grow:
16.
Thine is the day, the Suns fair light,
Thine are the courses of the night:
17.
The borders which the earth confine,
Are set and bounded by Thy line;
The Summers heat, and winters cold,
From Thee their yearly seasons hold.
18
Remember, Lord! Thy House defiled,
Thy Name by blasphemies reviled:
19,
O give not up Thy Turtles life,
A spoil to adversaries strife:
Let not Thy Congregation mourn,
Reproached by Them, of Thee forlorn:
20.
Look on the Covenant, and see
Earth dark'ned by their cruelty.
21.
Let not the oppressed return with shame,
But let the needy praise Thy Name.
22.
Arise (O God!) maintain Thy cause,
Thy Temples honor, and Thy Laws.
Remember their blaspheming noise,
Thine enemies insulting voice.
23.
Their insolence, who Thee despise,
Does still increase and higher rise.
PSALM. LXXV.
1.
TO Thee (O God) with grateful heart,
To Thee we thanks impart.
How near, and helpful is Thy Name,
Thy wondrous works proclaim.
2.
When I, advanced to Judah's throne,
Shall rule the Nation;
In justice will I take delight,
And judge the peoples right.
3.
The earth, with her inhabitants,
Through fear dissolves and faints.
Yet of her loose, declining frame
The Pillars I sustain.
4.
I said unto the foolish men;
Deal not so madly then:
And unto those, Gods precepts scorn,
Exalt not you the horn.
5.
Lift not your selves against His check,
Nor speak with a stiff neck.
6.
Promotion comes not from the east,
Nor South, nor from the West.
7.
But God as Judge our fortune guides,
Our lot of life divides:
He one man lifts unto the Crown,
And puts another down.
8.
He holds a cup, whose wine is red,
Full mixed, and tempered:
For wicked ones the dreg, and lee,
Wrong out to drink shall be.
9.
I will in Songs of praise declare,
The God of Jacobs care;
10.
The horns of Pride cut off will I,
But lift the Just on high.
PSALM. LXXVI.
Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandments.
1.
IN Judah God is known; His Name
The Israelites for Great proclaim.
2.
His Tabernacles Salem grace,
And Sion is His dwelling place.
3.
There He the Bow and arrows broke,
And Battles to confusion shook.
The glittering sword, the guarding shield,
Could not resist, nor safety yield.
4.
Thou of more honor art then they,
Who rove upon the Hills of prey:
5.
For They, whose pride did us embroile,
Are now themselves become a spoil.
A lasting sleep shuts up their eyes,
And all their strength in weakness dies:
6.
At Thy rebuke the barbed horse,
And armed Chariots loose their force.
7.
Thou Lord art feared; who may withstand
The fury of Thy powerful hand?
8.
From Heaven we Thy Judgments heard,
The trembling earth was still, and feared.
9.
When God the meek and humble saves,
But gives the proud untimely graves,
10.
He on their fall his fame does raise,
And turns their malice to His praise.
11.
Vow to the Lord your God, and bring
To Him your promised offering:
12.
He Princes spirits can restrain,
And Kings of earth with terror chain.
PSALM. LXXVII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
I Cried to God with accents shrill;
To God that hears my prayer still.
2.
When into times of trouble brought,
I unto Him for succor sought.
All night my anguish did not cease;
My soul no comfort found, nor ease.
3.
I think on God amidst my pains,
My vexed spirit to Him complains.
4.
My sleeples eyes Thou hold'st awake;
My tongue perplexed nothing spoke.
5.
The days of old I meditate,
The ancient times expired date.
6.
I to remembrance call my Song,
My wonted mirth, omitted long:
All night I commune with my heart,
My spirits search to ease my smart.
7.
Will God for ever us reject?
Nor by His favor us protect?
Is His compassion lost and gone;
His promises not thought upon?
9.
Has God His pity now forgot?
Or must destruction be our lot?
Or will His wrath, by sin renewed,
His tender mercies quite exclude?
10.
Thus I complained: And then said I,
This is mine own infirmity.
But I remember will the years
Thy right hand kept from want, or fears.
11.
The wonders which Thou did of old
Shall with my thankful tongue be told.
12.
My heart Thy works Shall meditate,
My words Thy noble acts relate.
13.
Thy ways (O God!) most holy are;
Who with Thy greatness may compare?
14.
In miracles, and wondrous signs
Thy strength among the People shines.
15.
Thou with that high victorious hand,
Not all the Nations could withstand,
The Sons of Jacob did redeem;
And Joseph's offspring wilt esteem.
16.
O God the waters at Thy sight
Unto their depths retired with fright:
The billows of the troubled maine
Shrunk down, and hid themselves again
17.
The melting cloud discharged in showers,
Like to a falling tempest powers:
Whilst sounds of horror tear the sky,
And through the air thine arrows fly.
18
Loud thunder from the heavens struck,
Thy lightnings shone, earths fabric shook:
19.
In the great waters lies Thy path,
Which where Thou go no footsteps has.
20.
Thy people Thou like sheep have led,
Saved from the Sea, in deserts fed:
And brought them to their promised land,
By Moses and by Aarons hand.
PSALM. LXXVIII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
Hear, O my people, and incline
Your ear unto my Laws divine.
2.
I will dark Parables unfold,
3.
Which we have heard from fathers told.
4.
We will not from succession hide
His works in praises magnified:
5.
Who gave a Law to Israel,
Which Parents must to Children tell.
6.
That generations yet unborne
Might know their duty to perform?
7.
That they their hope in God may set;
And not His works, or Law forget:
8.
Nor like their fathers, rebels prove,
With hearts unstedfast in His love:
9.
Like those revolters Ephraim bred,
Who armed from the battle fled.
10.
They Gods command, and Pact refused;
11.
His works forgate, and power abused:
12.
When Egypts land, and Zoans field
Such marvailes to their sight did yield.
13.
For then divided He the deep,
The floods contracting to an heap:
14.
By day the Cloud their guide became;
At night He led them with a Flame.
15.
He Rocks in barren deserts clave,
Which drink like swelling rivers gave:
16
He caused full streams from drought to grow,
And waters made like torrents flow.
17.
Yet they, by sinning, Him forsook,
And in the desert did provoke.
18.
They tempted God by asking meat;
Which they for lust, not hunger, eat.
19.
Yea thus against their God they spoke:
Can He in deserts diet make?
20.
The Rock He did in streams divide;
But can He bread, or flesh provide?
21.
When God heard this, His just moved ire
Against Jacob kindled like a fire:
22.
Because their God they faithles grieved,
And His salvation not believed.
23.
Though his command the clouds had tried
The doors of heaven opened wide:
24.
He rained down Manna for their meat,
And gave them corn from heaven to eat.
25.
Thus man with Angels food was fed:
For to the full He gave them bread.
26.
He caused the Eastern wind to blow,
And made the South His plenty throw.
27.
He flesh, as dust, upon them rained;
The fowls like heaps of Sand remained.
28.
They 'midst their Camp with food were cloyed,
29.
And all they could desire, enjoyed.
30.
But whilst Their mouth the meat in took,
31.
God's wrath their best, and choicest struck.
32.
For all this, Israel sinned still,
His wonders slight, neglect His will.
Second Part.
33.
Therefore their days they vainly spend,
And all their years in trouble end.
34.
Yet when He slew them, then they sought,
And God to their remembrance brought:
They turned, and from their sin retired,
And early after God inquired.
35.
Then God They for their Rock esteemed,
Remembering He had them redeemed.
36.
Yet with their flattering mouth they ly'd;
37.
Their heart His Covenant denied:
38.
Though full of pity He forgave,
Restrained His wrath, and Them did save.
39.
For He remembered, They were frail,
Whose lusts above His Laws prevail:
As passing winds, so light and vain,
Which breathing out, nere come again.
40.
Often did they grieve Him, often rebel;
41.
Tempting the God of Israel.
42.
They thought not on His powerful arm,
Which kept them safe from hostile harm,
43.
How He His signs in Egypt wrought,
His wonders over Zoan brought:
44.
And turned their rivers into blood;
They could not drink the crimsin flood.
45.
He sent strange flies which them annoy;
And frogs, their plenty to destroy:
46.
Their fruits the Caterpillars eat,
And Locusts reaped the ploughman's sweat:
47.
With hail their swelling vines were lost,
Their Sycamores destroyed with frost:
48.
Their herds by tempest came to naught,
Their flocks the furious thunder smote.
49,
His fiercest wrath on them was spent;
Bad Angels were among them sent:
50.
Their souls not spared were from death,
Disease and plagues deprived their breath.
51.
The first borne He through Egypt slew,
The chief which Ham, or Nilus knew.
52.
But He His people led like sheep,
And did His flock in deserts keep.
Third Part.
53.
He brought them safe, and free from fear;
When their pursuers drowned were.
54.
And to His Sanctuary led,
The Mount His hand had purchased.
55.
The Heathen He before them drove,
Their land by line to Jacob gave;
And made their tribes in tents to dwell:
56.
Who tempting God, again rebel.
57.
They like their fathers backward slide;
As bows deceitful, turned aside.
58.
High places Him provoke, and prove;
His jealousy their Idols move.
59.
When God heard this, He waxed wroth,
And Israel did greatly loath:
60.
His Tabernacle He forsook,
And no delight in Shiloh took.
61.
Their strength He gave to captive bands;
His Glory to the Heathens hands:
He left His people to the sword;
His kindled wrath His Lot devoured.
63.
Their young men were consumed by fire;
Their maids in marriage none require:
64.
Their Priests were unto slaughter sent;
Nor did their widows them lament.
65.
Then did the Lord from sleep awake,
From wine as Giants spirit take:
66
Upon His flying foes He came,
And put them to perpetual shame.
67.
He Ioseph's Tent did then refuse,
Nor would the Tribe of Ephraim choose.
68.
But Iudahs Tribe He did elect,
Mount Sion, which His thoughts affect.
69.
His Sanctuary high He placed,
Like earth, which stands for ever fast.
70
His choice did then on David look,
And from amongst the Sheepfolds took:
71.
From following Ewes, he made him feed
His chosen People, Jacob's seed:
72.
Whom with a perfect heart he fed,
And by his skillful conduct led.
PSALM. LXXIX.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
O God the Heathen us invade,
Thine heritage a prey is made.
Thy Holy Temple they defile,
And Salem make their ruins pile.
2.
The bodies of thy servants ly,
To gorge the fowls through heaven that fly,
The carcasses of Saints are feasts,
To glut and feed devouring beasts:
3.
Their blood like water has been shed,
And none would see them buried.
4.
We are become our neighbors flowt,
Reproached and laughed at round about:
5.
How long Lord shall thy jealous ire,
Consume us like unquenched fire?
6.
Let thy fierce anger those devour,
Who neither fear thy Name, or power.
7
Let those at length thy judgments taste,
Whose furious rage laid Jacob wast.
8.
Remember not our former sin,
Nor how rebellious we have bin:
Let speedy mercies us prevent,
Who languish through thy punishment:
9.
Save us God, for thy great Name,
Forgive our sins, remove our shame.
10.
Why should in scorn the Heathen say,
Where is the God whom we obey?
O let the value of our blood,
In thy revenge be understood!
11.
And let the prisoners groans, and sighs,
Up to thy throne of mercy rise!
Deliver those are marked to die,
By their blood-thirsting cruelty.
12.
Let sevenfold vengeance them reward,
Who nor thy Church, nor thee regard:
And may those tongues which thee blaspheme
Become themselves reproaches theme.
13
So we thy People, and the sheep,
Which thine own Fold and Pastures keep,
Will thank thy goodness all our days,
And to succession sing thy praise.
PSALM. LXXX.
1
GReat Shepherd who do Israel keep,
And leadest Joseph like a sheep;
Give ear, and shine with glorious light,
O thou that dwell'st 'twixt Cherubs bright.
2
Before thy Tribes, now Captives made,
Stir up thy self and bring us aid:
Manasses, Ephraim behold,
And Benjamin to bondage sold.
3.
Turn us again O God of might,
And show to us thy comforts light;
Thy favor to thy servants deigne,
And then we shall be whole again.
4.
How long will thou displeased be,
With those who daily worship thee?
How long thy closed ear exclude
Their Prayers, who to Thee have su'd?
5.
Thou feedest Them with sorrows bread,
And tears for drink are measured;
6.
We are through strife and envy torn,
Our neighbors spoil, our haters scorn.
7.
Turn us again great God of might,
And show to us thy comforts light;
Thy favor to Thy servants deigne,
And then we shall be whole again.
8.
Thou did a Vine from Egypt bring,
Thy hand which planted, made it spring;
9.
And that it might have room to spread,
The Heathen were discomfited:
I'ts root Thou caused'st fast to stand,
And with fair branches fill the land;
10.
The Hills were covered with Her shade,
Her boughs like goodly Cedars made.
11.
Her Arms did from the River reach,
Unto the Swelling Oceans beach.
12.
Why have Thou then broke down her fense?
Exposing her to violence?
That all who pass along her place,
Pluck off her grapes, her stock deface;
13.
The Mountain beasts, the Forest Boar
Root up her plants, devour her store.
14.
Return O God! from heaven shine,
Visit Thy now despised Vine:
And what thy right hand once did plant,
O never may thy blessing want.
15.
Let all her branches flourish long,
Which for thy self thou made so strong.
16.
For though cut down, and burnt she lies,
Thy beams of love shall make her rise.
17.
Thy people strengthen and protect,
Whom for thy self Thou did elect:
18.
So will we not go back from Thee,
Whose name shall still invoked be.
19.
Turn us again O God of might,
And show to us Thy comforts light;
Thy favor to thy servants deigne;
And then we shall be whole again.
PSALM. LXXXI.
1.
TO God our strength lift up your voice,
And make a joyful noise.
2.
Let Timbrell, Psalm, the pleasant Lyre
With Psaltery conspire.
3.
The Trumpet in the New Moon blow,
In solemn triumph go:
4.
Which God did as a Law ordain
For Jacob to retain.
5.
This He to Joseph did command
In the Egyptian land;
Where I a language heard unknow'n,
And understood by none.
6.
His shoulder I from burdens eased,
From making bricks released.
7.
Thou did on me in trouble call,
Who ransomed thee from thrall.
In thunder from the breaking cloud
I answered thee alowd;
And at the waters where you strove
In Meribah did prove.
8.
Hear O my people! I will tell
To Thee O Israel:
9.
No Heathen Gods shall Thou adore,
Nor worship them before.
10.
I am thy God, who freedom wrought,
And Thee from Egypt brought.
Thy mouth enlarged, and opened wide,
By me shall be supplied.
11.
But they my precepts did neglect,
And Jacob Me reject:
12.
So left I them to lusts unknow'n,
And counsels of their own.
13.
O that my people would have heard,
And from my ways not errd.
14.
Their foes then had I soon subdued,
And with my hand pursued.
15.
No place God's haters should secure;
But they should still endure.
16.
I fed them had with finest wheat,
And honey, for their meat.
PSALM. LXXXII.
Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandments.
1.
GOd in the great assembly sits;
To Kings and Judges judgment fits.
2.
How long the right will ye reject,
And persons of the bad respect?
3.
The poor and fatherless defend,
Justice to men oppressed extend:
4.
Deliver those in need that stand,
And save them from the wicked's hand.
5.
They will not understand, nor know;
But in the mists of darkness go.
Earths bases all are out of course,
Whilst justice fails, and Law wants force.
6.
I said, that Kings are Gods on earth,
And sons derived from highest birth.
7.
But ye like other men shall die,
And with the fallen Princes ly.
8.
O God! whose power does all comprise,
In judgment on the earth arise.
For all the nations scattered far,
Thy lot, and Tributaries are.
PSALM. LXXXIII.
1.
DO not (O God) Thou silence keep,
Nor let Thy vengeance sleep;
2.
Thy hateful foes lift up their head,
In tumults gathered.
3.
With craft, and counsels of deceit,
They plot, and ly in wait;
How they Thy People may annoy,
And Thine elect destroy.
4.
Come let us (say this furious rout,)
Their Nation quite root out;
And let the name of Israel be
Lost to all memory.
5.
In consultations full of hate,
Against Thee confederate,
6.
Edom with Ishmael combine,
Moab with Hagars line.
7.
Gebal, and Ammon against us fight,
With the Amalekite:
The Philistines armed bands conspire,
With those that dwell at Tire:
8.
And Ashur runs in to their aid,
Prepared to invade;
They strengthen Lots incestuous race,
Our dwellings to deface.
9.
But Thou like Midian them confound;
Whose sword themselves did wound:
Like Sisera O make them all,
Who did at Kishon fall.
10.
Be they as Iabin swollen with pride,
Whose dreadful Armies died:
Their carcasses in Endor flung,
Were spread on earth as dung.
11.
Let Oreb's, Zeb's, Zalmunna's fate,
Reward their Princes hate,
12.
Who said, let us our force address,
Gods Houses to possess.
13.
My God! O make them like a wheel,
As straw in winds to reele;
14.
As raging fires their fuel burn,
And Hills to ashes turn;
15.
So with Thy tempest them pursue,
With storms their fear renew.
16.
O Lord! their faces fill with shame,
That they may seek Thy Name.
17.
Let them confounded ever stand,
And perish by Thy hand;
18.
That men may know, Iehovahs Name
Rules all this earthly frame.
PSALM. LXXXIV.
1.
HOw lovely, Thou great Lord of war,
Thy Tabernacles are!
2.
My longing soul is faint, and pained,
Whilst from thy Courts restrained.
My heart, my flesh, with all that give
Me power to move, or live,
Cry loud, till they admitted be
The living God to see.
3.
Yea Sparrows find a house to rest;
The Swallow builds her nest:
Their young they to thine Altar bring,
O Lord, my God and King.
4.
Blessed are they, who all their days
Thee in thy Temple praise.
5.
Blessed is the man, whose strength Thou art;
Whose ways direct his heart.
6.
Who passing through the mournful vale,
Where springs and comforts fail,
Make wells in Baca's barren plain,
And pooles to fill with rain.
7.
They go from strength to strength, nor faint
Through weariness or want;
Till to thy House approaching near
In Sion they appear.
8.
Lord God of Hosts, my prayer hear;
O Jacob's God give ear!
9.
O God our Shield, look down with grace
On Thine Annointed's face.
10.
One day, which in Thy Courts He spends,
Thousands of ours transcends.
I Would rather keep a door with thee,
Then all earth's glory see.
11.
For God our shield, our Sun, and light,
Crowns those that walk upright.
Nor fails all good such men to give,
Who in His Statutes live.
12.
O Lord of Hosts, great God of Might,
Who dwell'st in endless light:
How blessed shall that servant be,
Who puts his trust in Thee?
PSALM. LXXXV.
1.
LOrd! to thy land Thou good have been,
Which has Thy favor seen:
Thou Jacob's Offspring have set free
From thtir captivity.
2.
Thou thy forgivenes did dispense,
To cover all offense.
3.
Thou have removed Thy wrath which burned,
And from thy fiercenes turned.
4.
Turn us O God of health, and peace,
O cause Thine anger cease.
5.
Will Thou displeased for ever be
With all posterity?
6.
Will Thou not us again receive?
Thy peoples joys enlive?
7.
Lord show That mercy which we want,
And Thy salvation grant.
8.
I will what God declares attend,
For He His peace will send,
And cures His Saints of all their pain,
If they not sin again.
9.
For His salvation is near,
To such as do Him fear:
That glory in our land may dwell,
And all things prosper well.
10.
Mercy with Truth united is;
Justice and Peace do kiss.
11.
Truth springing out of earth is struck,
And Right from Heaven does look.
12.
The Lord shall give us all things good;
Our land yield store of food.
13.
Before Him Righteousness shall go,
His ways and steps to show.
PSALM. LXXXVI.
1.
BOw down thine ear (Lord) to my cry,
Poor, and in misery:
2.
Preserve my guiltles soul, whose faith
On thee depended has.
3.
Show mercy (Lord!) for, all the day,
Before thy throne I pray:
4.
Rejoice thy servants soul, which he
Lifts up (O Lord) to thee.
5.
Thou good and gracious do live,
And ready to forgive:
Thou plenteous mercy keep'st in store,
For all who Thee implore.
6.
Unto my prayer (Lord) give ear,
My supplications hear:
7.
In time of trouble, and of grief,
Thou sendest me releife.
8.
Among earths Gods, or Powers Divine,
No works are like to thine.
9.
The Nations all, whom Thou did frame,
Shall glorify Thy Name.
10.
Thou wonders do (Great God) alone;
11.
Thy way to me make known.
My heart unto thy fear unite,
Who in thy name delight.
12.
Then I my faculties will raise,
To honor Thee with praise;
13.
Who do my soul in mercy save
From the devouring grave.
14.
O God! the proud against me rise,
In furious companies:
Ungodly men my life have sought,
Who set thy power at naught.
15.
But Thou, a God compassionate,
Whose mercies not abate,
Long suffering art, and patient,
To pardon sinners bent.
16.
O turn to me in love again;
Let me thy pity gain.
Give strength, and from destruction
O save Thine handmaids son.
Some token of thy favor deigne,
Which may my haters shame.
Because Thou Lord have brought me aid,
And art my comfort made.
PSALM. LXXXVII.
1.
UPon the Holy Mountains breast,
Where God Himself does rest,
By His protection firmly stayed
Are Her foundations laid.
2.
The Lord, who Sion did elect,
Her gates does more affect,
Then all the numerous tents beside
Where Jacob's sons abide.
3.
Jerusalem! thou City fair,
God's dwelling, and His care!
Of thee, thou throne of Iudahs Kings,
Are spoken glorious things.
4.
I will strong Rahab mention,
With high-towr'd Babylon:
The scorched Ethiopian lands,
The plains where Tyrus stands;
Philistia too shall reck'ned be,
With those acknowledge me:
5.
For every quarter of the earth
Gives Sions children birth.
God shall establish Her on high,
Her numbers multiply:
When Nations far dispersed shall
Be gathered at His call.
6.
And when the Lord His Churches fruits
With all Her Sons computes,
They shall amongst His people known
Be counted for his own.
7.
The Singers too rehearsed are,
Who there His praise declare;
From whence arise fresh springs of Grace,
To water every place.
PSALM. LXXXVIII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
TO Thee (O Lord) who me do save,
Both day and night I cried have.
2.
Lend to my voice a gracious ear;
3.
Whose troubled soul to death draws near.
4.
Cast down to earth, I amongst the dead
5.
Am only free, and numbered.
Like those who in the grave forgot,
By thee cut off, corrupt and rot.
6.
Thou in the lowest pit have laid,
And darkest deeps my covring made:
7.
I am hard pressed by Thy wrath,
And every wave afflicted has:
8.
Thou mine acquaintance have removed,
And severed me from those I loved:
Their friendship turned is to hate;
My life shut up, and desolate.
9.
My weeping eye does daily mourn,
My hands stretched out, my hopes forlorn.
10.
Will thou show wonders to the dead,
To praise Thee raised, and wakened?
11.
Shall the devouring grave declare,
How true thy promised mercies are?
12.
Or shall the dark Thy wonders see,
The land where all forgotten be?
13.
To Thee (O Lord) my cries are sent:
My prayer shall the morn prevent:
14.
O why do Thou my soul reject,
And hid'st from me Thy blessed aspect?
15.
Afflicted, and in misery,
I almost ready am to die;
From youth to age, in life's each act,
Thy suffered terrors me distract?
16.
Thy wrath quite over me does go,
Thine indignation strikes me so:
17.
They, like the raging floods abound,
Or swelling waters, me surround.
18.
My friends, and all my lovers are
By Thee, from my relief put far.
And those who my acquaintance were,
Concealed, or lost, my sight forbear.
PSALM. LXXXIX.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
MY Song thy mercies shall make known,
Thy truth to all succession.
2.
For They built up for ever last:
And are in Heaven established fast:
3.
I to my chosen David swear,
And did by Covenant declare;
4.
I stablish will thy seed alone,
And build to Thee a lasting Throne.
5.
The Heavens Thy wonders praise confess,
And Saints procIaime thy faithfulness.
For who in earth, or heaven are,
6.
Whose might can with the Lord compare?
7.
Feared by His Saints, by them implored,
And by His servants still adored.
8.
O Lord of Hosts, who is so strong?
Whose word, like thine, endures so long?
9.
Thou rul'st the Seas that rage and rise,
Whose swelling wave becalmed lies:
10.
Thou Rahah brak'st, like one that is dead;
Thine arm thy foes has scattered.
11.
The Heavens are Thine, with earth's increase,
And all the fullness grows from these.
12.
The North and South thy power did frame,
Tahor and Hermon praise thy Name.
13
Thy mighty arm is lifted high;
Thy right hand full of Majesty.
14.
Thy Throne has justice for its base,
Mercy and Truth before Thy face.
15.
Blessed are they, who at Thy Feasts,
And in Thy presence, are the guests.
16.
They all the day rejoice in Thee,
In righteousness exalted be.
17.
Thy strength and glory them adorn,
Whose favor shall lift up our horn.
18.
The Lord to us does safety bring;
Thy Holy one remains our King.
19.
In visions Thou to Him have said:
I on my chosen help have laid.
20.
I have my servant David found,
With Oil anointed Him, and crowned.
21.
Confirmed, and strengthened by my arm,
I will protect his life from harm.
22.
No enemy on Him exact,
Nor hurt him shall, by wicked pact:
23.
His foes beat down before him fly,
And shall by plagues consumed die.
24.
My mercy yet, to him assured,
Shall in his glory be secured.
Second Part.
26.
His right hand; lifted ore the maine,
Shall to the inland rivers reign.
26.
He, crying in his prayers, shall,
My God, and Rock, and Father, call:
27.
I Will make him heir, my first begot;
Above earth's Kings advance his lot:
28.
To Him my mercy nere shall wast;
My Covenant stand ever fast.
29.
His seed shall long endure, his Throne
Like Heavens unwearied motion.
30.
But if His Sons my Law forsake,
31.
Or my Commands and Statutes break;
32.
My rod shall punish their neglect,
My hand with stripes their sin correct.
33.
Yet shall my love to him prevail,
34.
My Covenant nor change, nor fail.
35.
To David have I sworn, that I
My promise would not falsify:
36.
His seed shall govern, whilst the sun
About the world his course does run;
37.
And like the Moon established be
The faithful pledge of my decree.
38.
But thine anointed now thy wrath
Cast off, and quite abhorred has.
39.
Thou void have made the Covenant sealed;
Profaned his crown, his Rule repealed:
40.
His Bulwarks broke, his senses torn,
41.
Make him his neighbor's spoil, and scorn.
42.
Thou strengthened have his foes right hand,
That he in battle cannot stand;
44.
His sword wants edge, His glory's gone;
And to the earth cast down his throne.
45.
Thou short'ned have his youth; His fame
Obscured, and covered is with shame.
46.
Lord! will Thou ever from us turn?
Or shall, like fire, thine anger burn?
47.
Remember yet how short my days;
How vain man's life, how soon decaies.
48.
What mortal lives, who shall not die?
And in the pit of silence ly?
49.
Where are thy mercies (Lord!) the faith
Thy oath to David plighted has?
50.
Remember (Lord) thy servants shame;
How mighty people us defame:
51.
Think how thy foes have us abused,
And thine Annointed's steps traduced.
52.
Yet shall my soul, how ere oppressed,
Say evermore, The Lord be blessed.
PSALM. XC.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
O Lord! Thou have our refuge been;
All ages have thy mercies seen.
2.
Before the lofty hills were made,
Or earth's unmoved foundation laid:
From everlasting Thou art God,
And wilt out live times period:
3.
Thou turn'st to dust the Sons of men:
Then say, Return to life again.
4.
A thousand years in thy account
But to a day with us amount:
Nor are extended in thy sight,
Beyond the watch of one short night:
5.
Our time runs on like rapid streams;
We vanish as forgotten dreams:
6.
Like grass or morning flowers, we spring;
Then wither in the evening.
7.
When Thou displeased art, we wast,
And unto nothing come at last.
8.
Thou mark'st our deeds; our sins of night
Are always open to thy sight;
Making the breach of thy pure Laws,
Our death, and swift destructions cause.
9.
From whence we suddenly wax old,
Expiring like a tale that is told.
10.
The common Age of mortal men
Exceeds not Threescore years and ten.
And if to Fourscore they attain,
Their life is but a lengthened pain.
Incessant sorrows, and disease,
Their faculties, and vigor seize.
For soon cut off our days decay,
And suddenly we fly away.
11.
But who regards Thy heavy wrath,
Or of Thy fear true feeling has?
Neither Thy judgments, nor Thy love,
Can us unto repentance move.
12.
Lord! so our days to number teach,
We may the end of wisdom reach:
And learn those errors to forget,
Which us in Thy displeasure set.
13
Return (O Lord!) and now repent
At our endured punishment.
How long will Thou thy help delay,
Or not remove our woes away?
14.
O satisfy our Soul with joys,
To recompense Life's past annoyes.
15.
Afford us comfort for those years,
We were enforced to spend in tears.
16.
Lord! Let Thy glorious work appear,
Thy servants from the dust to rear.
That all succeeding times may know,
What praises to thy Name we owe.
17.
O let thy beams of favor shine
On those, who in death's shade have ly'n.
Grant that for which we prayers make;
And prosper all we undertake.
PSALM. XCI.
1.
WHo so in God's protection dwell,
Abide secure, and well:
For shadowed by the Almighties care
Both soul and body are.
2.
I therefore to the Lord will say,
Thou art my hope and stay.
Thou art my refuge, my strong hold,
Who do my faith embold.
3.
He shall preserve Thee from the net,
Which cunning hunters set:
Protecting thee by His defense,
In times of Pestilence.
4.
He over thee His wings shall spread,
With safety covered:
And least temptation make thee yield,
His truth shall be thy shield.
5.
The ghastly terrors of the night
Shall not thy peace affright:
Nor arrows, which by day do kill,
Thy life with slaughter spill.
6.
No tainted air, or noisome Pest
Thy dwelling shall infest.
No perils, which at noon destroy,
Thy safety shall annoy.
7.
Though Thousands, or ten thousands died,
Thick falling by thy side;
Thou shall unhurt, and guarded stand
From sickness on each hand.
8.
Thine eye the wicked shall behold
Unto destruction sold:
9.
Yet them nor fears, nor dangers shake,
Who God their refuge make.
10.
No evil hap shall Thee distaste,
Nor plague thy dwelling wast.
11.
For He his Angels shall command
Thy Centinells to stand.
12.
In all thy ways they shall thee keep,
Whither thou wake, or sleep.
And least a stone thy foot should hurt,
Their hands shall thee support.
13.
No Basilisk, nor Adders sting
Thy life in danger bring.
Thou shall upon the Lion tread,
And bruise the Dragons head.
14.
Because his love is set on me,
I will his guardian be:
Since he acknowledged has My name,
I will exalt his fame.
15.
When ere he calls, I will him hear,
In trouble, and in fear.
I will to honor him advance;
And send deliverance.
16.
With length of life, and happy days
I will his comforts raise.
And when his time on earth is done,
Give him salvation.
PSALM. XCII.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
IT is a good and blessed thing
Praise to Thy Name (most High) to sing:
2.
Thy kindness before the morning light
To show, Thy faithfulness each night.
3.
Upon a ten-string'd instrument
With Psalteries well-tuned concent,
And on the solemne-sounding Lyre,
Where all harmonious notes conspire.
4.
For Thou (O Lord) my heart have made,
Through all Thy hands atchieuements, glad;
Who, in Thy works, which earth do fill,
Rejoice, and always triumph will.
O Lord! how great Thy actions are?
Deep are Thy thoughts, and hidden far.
The brutish do not this attend,
Nor will the fools it apprehend.
7.
When like the Grass, or flowers which spring,
The wicked men are flourishing,
Even then their quick destruction hasts.
8.
But (Lord!) Thy glory ever lasts.
9.
For lo, throw'n down and scattered all
Thine enemies before Thee fall.
10.
How ere, Thou will exalt my horn,
Like to the stately Unicorne.
With freshest oil, and balm new shed,
Thou will anoint my conquering head:
11.
Mine eye shall see its just desire
On those, who against my life conspire:
And for those wicked enemies,
Who to my safeties hazard rise,
Mine ears shall hear them come to naught,
By Thy revenge to ruin brought.
12.
The righteous like the Palm shall grow,
Or Cedars on the mountains brow.
13.
Who in Gods House emplanted be,
Within His courts we prosper see.
14.
In their old age they fruit shall bring;
Continue fat, and flourishing:
15.
To show, the Lord my Rock is just,
With whom no wicked harbor must.
PSALM. XCIII.
1.
THe Lord our God does reign on high,
Clothed with Majesty.
He vested is with glorious light,
And girds Himself with might.
The world created by His hand,
Established does stand
So fast and firm upon its base,
It moves not from the place.
2.
Yet far more stable, and more old,
Thy Throne (O Lord) shall hold.
Which, when earth's fabric melts and wastes,
Like Thee, for ever lasts.
3.
The floods (O Lord!) lift up their voice,
In uproare, and in noise,
The swelling waves up-lifted rise,
To band against the skies.
4.
Yet is the Lord more mighty far
Then those proud waters are:
And stronger then the Oceans wave,
Which winds enchafed have.
5.
Thy Testimonies true and sure
Eternally endure.
And holiness becomes (O God!)
The house of Thine abode.
PSALM. XCIV.
1.
O God! who just revenge do take,
Now let Thy vengeance wake.
2.
Great Judge of earth arise, from hence
The proud to recompense.
3.
How long (Lord) shall their wicked host,
How long triumph and boast?
4.
How long shall their insulting tongue
Joy in Thy servants wrong?
5.
They break Thy people (Lord) in rage,
Afflict Thine heritage.
6.
They widows slay, the poor oppress,
And kill the fatherless.
7.
Yet hardened in presumption, they,
The Lord not sees us, say;
Great Jacobs God does not regard,
Nor will the sin reward.
8.
Take heed ye brutish and unwise,
Who thus your crimes disguise.
Ye foolish people of the land,
When will ye understand?
9.
Think ye, that he who plants the ear
Unable is to hear?
Or shall not he, who formed the eye,
Your wickedness descry?
10.
Shall he, who Nations overthrew,
Not know to punish you?
11.
To whose all-searching view is brought*
The vainnes of man's thought.
12.
Blessed, (O Lord) and happy he,
Who chast'ned is by Thee;
Whom Thou in mercy do correct,
And in Thy Law direct.
13.
That though with crosses over-prest,
He may in patience rest,
Till for transgressors ruin he
A pit prepared see.
14.
For God his people not rejects,
Nor his own choice neglects:
15.
But judgment all their wrongs shall right,
And comfort the upright.
16.
Who will with me against those rise,
Who work iniquities?
17.
But, from the Lord my help was seen,
My soul had silenced been.
18.
When I, my slipping foot, complained,
Thy mercy me sustained,
19.
When thoughts my grieved soul excite,
Thy comforts her delight.
20.
Will Thou support the wicked's throne,
Or join it with Thine own?
Who, under Laws, and Reason's name,
Their acts of mischief frame.
21.
Whose meetings, and whose plots are bent,
The just to circumvent.
Who fit in Counsel, souls to kill,
And guiltles blood to spill.
22.
But yet the Lord is my defense,
God is my confidence;
My Rock, my refuge, and my tower,
To save me by His power.
23.
He on their heads the ills shall bring
Which from themselves did spring.
And in their sins God's vengfull hand
Shall cut them from the land.
PSALM. XCV.
1.
O Come, and let us to the Lord,
Our cheerful Songs record:
Unto our Rock lift up our voice,
And make a joyful noise.
2.
Let us with praise sent up on high
Approach His presence nigh:
With Psalms and Anthems glad express
Our bounden thankfulness.
3.
He is the God and King, whose hand
The spacious earth has spann'd:
4.
By Him steep hills, and seas were made;
5.
The dry land by Him laid.
6.
Come, let us worship and adore,
Kneel down the Lord before:
7.
For He our God is, we His care,
His sheep, and people are.
To day if ye His voice will hear,
8.
No hardened heart bring near;
Like that provoking in the day
You in the desert lay.
9.
When your forefathers tempted me,
Who did my wonders see:
10.
And forty years you Tribes did pass,
Wherein I grieved was.
I said, my people err in heart,
And wilfully depart;
My ways prescribed they have not known,
Nor in my precepts gone.
11.
To whom my just incensed wrath
By oath protested has,
Those murmurers should nere be blessed,
Or enter to my rest.
PSALM. XCVI.
Sing this as Psalm 51. or 100.
1.
A New Song to the Lord rehearse,
Sing to him all the Universe.
2.
O bless his Name, in Songs display
His saving mercies every day.
His glory, and his wonders tell
3.
To Nations who far distant dwell.
4.
This great Lord must be greatly praised,
Whose fear above all Gods is raised.
5.
For Heathen Gods are Idols vain:
But it is the Lord does heaven sustain.
6.
Honor, and awe are him before,
His sanctuary strong in power.
7.
Ye kindreds then on earth that live,
Unto the Lord due honor give:
8.
Ascribe all glory to his Name,
And let his Courts with offerings flame.
9.
O worship him, your zeal express,
In beauty, and in holiness.
Let all the earth before him fear,
And say, God does the Scepter bear.
10.
The world shall be established so,
It shall not from its fast'nings go.
He to the people righteously
His final judgment shall apply.
11.
Let earth be glad, and heaven rejoice;
The roaring Ocean make a noise:
12.
Be glad ye fruits sprung from the fields,
With all the trees the forest yields:
13.
For lo, to judgment God does come,
He comes to give the earth it is doom;
His just revenge the world pursu'th,
To judge the people with his truth.
PSALM. XCVII.
1.
LEt earth rejoice that God does reign,
And Isles within the maine.
2.
Darkness and clouds wait Him upon;
And Justice is His Throne.
3.
Devouring fire before Him goes,
To burn His circling foes.
4.
Throughout the world His lightnings blaze,
Which trembling earth amaze.
5.
Hills at his presence turned to fume,
Like melting wax consume;
6.
The Heavens His righteousness proclaim,
And men confess His fame.
7.
Let quick perdition all confound
To worship Idols bound:
Who boast in Stocks, and from Him swerve,
Whom all the Gods must serve.
8.
Sion and Judah both rejoiced,
To hear Thy judgments voyc'd;
9.
With whose exalted state none dare,
Or men, or Gods, compare.
10.
Who love the Lord, and do His will,
See that ye hate all ill:
He does from wicked hands protect
The souls of His Elect.
11.
Unto the Godly springs a light,
And joy to the upright.
12.
Let righteous men their Lord then bless,
And praise His Holiness.
PSALM. XCVIII.
1.
Unto the Lord your Songs renew,
Who marvailes wrought for you.
His holy arm, and His right hand
The victory has gained.
2.
God His salvation has made known,
His truth to Heathens shown.
3.
His mercies have remembered been,
Earth His Salvation seen.
4.
Make to the Lord a joyful noise;
Earth, in loud Songs rejoice:
5,
With Harps unto your Maker sing,
And Psalms tuned to the string.
6.
With Trumpets, and the Cornets sound
Let your full joys rebound.
All in your shrillest accents sing
Before the Lord your King.
7,
Let roaring Seas for gladness swell;
The world with those there dwell:
8.
Floods clap their hands, the waves combine,
All Hills in praises join.
9.
For lo, to Judgment God does come,
To give the earth it is doom.
With justice He the world will try,
And men with Equity.
PSALM. XCIX.
1.
THe Lord does reign: ye people all
With trembling before Him fall.
His throne 'twixt Cherubs He does make:
Let earth be moved and shake.
2.
The Lord is in His Sion great,
Above the world His Seat;
3.
Let all the Holiness proclaim
Of His most awful Name.
4.
This King of strength true Judgment loves,
And equity approves,
Thou do Thy righteous judgments fruit
In Jacob execute.
5.
Exalt the Lord, and Him adore,
His footstool fall before.
6.
Moses, and Aaron amongst His Priests,
On whom His service rests.
And Samuel amongst those that came
To supplicate His Name.
These called on Him, and when they prayed,
He gracious answer made
7.
He from the pillar of the Cloud
Did speak to them aloud:
Whose Testimonies they obay'd,
Nor from His statutes strayed.
8.
Thou answer'dst them, O Lord our God!
With mercy us'dst Thy rod:
Their sins Thy wrath did not forbear;
Yet they forgiven were.
9.
The Lord our God then magnify;
Exalt His praise on high:
And worship at His sacred Hill;
For God is holy still.
PSALM. C.
1.
MAke to the Lord a joyful noise,
All lands to Him lift up your voice:
2.
Serve Him with gladness, let your tongue
Approach His presence with a Song.
3.
Know He is God, by whose hand we,
And not our own, created be:
We are His people, and the sheep
His folds enclose, His pastures keep.
4.
Enter with thanks His dwelling place,
And let His Courts resound with praise:
Your gratitude to Him profess;
His glorious Name for ever bless.
5.
For He is good, and great His care,
His mercies everlasting are;
His truth eternally shall last,
When Time, and all successions wast.
PSALM. CI.
1.
I Mercy will, and Judgment sing,
To Thee my Lord and King.
2.
I wisely will my steps direct
In ways of Thine elect.
O when will Thou to me come near?
Thy presence when appear?
Who in my house with perfect heart
Will nere from Thee depart.
3.
No wicked thing before mine eyes
Will I behold, or prize.
I hate the work of them, whose pride
From Thee does turn aside.
4.
A wicked man, and froward heart
Shall from my thoughts depart:
Nor with the sinful, or perverse
My knowledge shall converse.
5.
I will cut off the man, whose spite
His neighbor does back-bite.
With him, whose heart, or look is high,
I never will comply.
6.
Upon the faithful of the land
Mine eyes shall fixed stand.
Who walks in the perfect way,
Shall in my service stay.
7.
My house shall never give receipt
To him that works deceit:
Nor shall he tarry in my sight,
Who does in lies delight.
8.
All those in wickedness that joy
I early will destroy;
And from the City of the Lord
Cut all whom He abhorred.
PSALM. CII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
Hear me (O Lord!) and let my cry*
To Thy bright throne ascend on high.
2.
Hide not Thy face in time of need,
But answer my request with speed.
3.
For all my days away consume
Like to the smoke, or rising fume.
My bones like fired brands became,
Burnt up and scorched in sorrows flame.
4.
My heart like grass is withered,
And I forget to eat my bread:
5.
I wast and pine in daily groans,
That scarce my flesh cleaves to my bones:
6.
Like Pelicans removed from sight,
Or Owls in deserts shunning light:
7.
As sparrowes their lost mates bemoane,
So do I watch, and fit alone.
8.
I with reproach all day am torn
Of enemies against me sworn;
9.
I ashes eat instead of bread,
And drink the tears my sorrows shed.
10.
Which mischeifs from thy wrath are grow'n
Since thou who raised, have cast me down.
11.
Thus like the dark declining shade,
Or dying flower, I hourly fade.
12.
Yet thou (O Lord do still endure,
From times successive change secure.
13.
Thou therefore shall in mercy rise,
And Sion help, which ruined lies;
The time is come for her repair,
14.
Whose stones and rubbish prized are.
Thy servants pity her neglect,
And on her dust with sighs reflect.
15.
So shall the Heathen fear Thy Name,
And Kings Thy Majesty proclaim.
16.
When God shall Sions buildings rear,
And in His glory shall appear;
17.
He will regard the poor man's suit,
And not despise the destitute:
18.
This shall be written for record,
That after Times may praise the Lord.
Second Part.
19.
The Lord from high His beams displayed;
And, out of Heaven, earth survay'd;
20.
The Captives fetters to unty,
And Prisoners save condemned to die.
21.
That so in Sions blessed hill,
And Salem which His wonders fill,
22.
They may His name, and praise declare,
When all the people gathered are.
23.
He has my strength to weakness brought,
My Short'ned days are come to naught:
24.
So that to God I thus did pray;
O take me not as yet away:
Nor cast me off from this life's stage,
In prime of youth, and midst of age.
For though My days be few, and frail,
Thy years, O God, will never fail.
25.
Thou (Lord) have earth's foundation laid,
And by Thy hand the Heavens were made:
They all shall perish, and decay,
And in their time consume away.
Like to a garment, when grow'n old,
They shall nor use, nor motion hold.
But though the world, and they must fall,
Thy Being is perpetual.
27.
Yea as a vesture worn, and changed,
Is from it is gloss and form estranged:
So Shall Thou change this massy frame;
Yet still Thy self abide the same.
28.
And like Thy self from changes freed,
Thou will prolong Thy servants seed;
Whose children shall remain with Thee,
And in Thy sight established be.
PSALM. CIII.
As Psalm 51.
1.
MY Soul thy best devotion raise
To bless the Lord, and sing His praise.
2.
O never unremembred be
The benefits He powered on thee:
3.
Whose pardon does all sins release,
And keep thy body from disease:
4.
Who thee redeemed, to death cast down,
And does thy life with mercies crown.
5.
Who with good things shall fill thy mouth;
And eagle-like renew thy youth.
6.
He by right judgment has redrest
All such as are by wrong oppressed.
7.
His ways have known to Moses been;
The Israelites His works have seen.
8.
All which His will, and nature show,
To mercy swift, to vengeance slow.
9.
He will not always with us chide;
Nor let His anger long abide:
10.
Nor deals according to our sin,
Nor have our crimes rewarded bin.
11.
For high as Heaven is earth above,
So large, so boundless is his love;
12.
Removing all our sins as far,
As East and West divided are.
13.
Yea like a Father's to his Son,
To us is his compassion.
14
He knows our frame too weak to trust,
Remembering that we are but dust.
15.
The days of man, like to the grass,
Or fading flower, to nothing pass.
16.
Which blow'n and shaken by the wind,
Leave neither place, nor print behind.
17.
His goodness though, confirmed, and sure,
To childrens children does endure.
18.
Even unto such, whose clear intents
Walk after His Commandments.
19.
The Lord in heaven prepares His throne,
And governs all the world alone.
O therefore bless that powerful Lord,
Who made, and rules us by His word.
20.
Ye Angels that in strength excel,
And never against His word rebel:
21.
Ye winged Ministers, who still
Prepared are to act His will:
Ye Heavenly hosts, and creatures all,
22.
Bless Him, and at His footstool fall.
Lastly my Soul thy Maker praise,
And bless His goodness all thy days.
PSALM. CIV.
As Psalm 51.
1.
MY Soul the Lord for ever bless:
O God! Thy greatness all confess;
Whom Majesty and honor vest,
2.
In robes of Light eternal dressed.
He Heaven makes his Canopy;
3.
His chambers in the waters ly:
His Chariot is the cloudy storm,
And on the wings of wind is borne.
4.
He Spirits makes His Angels quire;
His Ministers a flaming fire.
5.
He so did earth's foundations cast,
It might remain for ever fast:
6.
Then clothed it with the spacious deep,
Whose wave outswells the mountains steep.
7.
At Thy rebuke the waters fled,
And hid their thunder-frighted head.
8.
They from the mountains streaming flow,
And down into the Valleys go:
Then to their liquid center have,
Where their collected floods are cast.
9.
These in the Ocean met, and joined,
Thou have within a bank confined:
Not suffering them to pass their bound,
Least earth by their excess be drowned.
10.
He from the hills his Crystal springs
Down running to the valleys brings:
11.
Which drink supply, and coolnes yield,
To thirsting beasts throughout the field.
12.
By them the fowls of heaven rest,
And singing in their branches nest.
13.
He waters from his clouds the Hills;
The teeming earth with plenty fills.
14.
He grass for Cattle does produce,
And every Herb for humane use:
That so He may His creatures feed,
And from the earth supply their need.
15.
He makes the clusters of the vine,
To glad the Sons of men with wine.
He oil to cheer the face imparts,
And bread, the strength'ner of their hearts.
Second Part.
16.
The trees, which God for fruit decreed,
Nor sap, nor moyst'ning virtue need.
The lofty Cedars by His hand
In Lebanon emplanted stand.
17.
Unto the birds these shelter yield,
And Storks upon the fir-trees build:
18.
Wild goats the hills defend, and feed,
And in the Rocks the Conies breed.
19.
He made the changing Moon appear,
To note the seasons of the year.
The Sun from Him his strength does get,
And knows the measure of his Set.
20.
Thou make the darkness of the night,
When beasts creep forth that shunned the light.
21.
Young Lions, roaring after prey,
From God their hunger must allay.
22.
When the bright Sun casts forth his ray,
Down in their Dens themselves they lay.
23.
Man's labor, with the morn begun,
Continues till the day be done.
24.
O Lord! what wonders have thou made,
In providence and wisdom laid?
The earth is with Thy riches crowned,
25.
And Seas, where creatures most abound.
26.
There go the ships, which swiftly fly,
There great Leviathan does ly,
Who takes his pastime in the flood:
27.
All these do wait on Thee for food.
28.
Thy bounty is on them distilled,
Who are by Thee with goodness filled.
29
But when thou hid'st Thy face, they die,
And to their dust returned ly.
30.
Thy spirit all with life endues,
The springing face of earth renewes.
31.
Gods glory ever shall endure,
Pleased in His works, from change secure.
32.
Upon the earth He looks down,
Which shrinks and trembles at His frown:
His lightnings touch, or thunders stroke,
Will make the proudest mountains smoke.
33
To Him my Ditties, whilst I live,
Or being have, shall praises give:
34
My Meditations will be sweet,
When fixed on Him my comforts meet.
35.
Upon the earth let sinners rot,
In place, and memory forgot.
But thou, my soul, thy Maker bless;
Let all the world His praise express,
PSALM. CV.
1.
O Thank the Lord, invoke His Name,
His deeds to all proclaim.
2.
With Psalms His praises eelebrate,
His wondrous works relate.
3.
Glory in Him ye whose desires,
And heart for God enquires,
4.
Seek ye the Lords all-pow'rfull might,
His faces glorious light.
5.
The works of wonder He has done,
And Judgments think upon,
6.
Ye who from faithful Abraham,
And chosen Jacob came.
7.
He is the Lord, whose judgments show'n
Through all the earth are known:
8.
He Covenant keeps in word and deed,
To thousands that succeed.
9.
To Abraham, and Izaak both
He promised with an oath;
10.
And for a Law His sacred pact
To Jacob did enact:
11.
In which He vowed, that Israel
In Canaans Land should dwell;
12.
When they in number weak, and few,
Nor place, nor people knew.
13.
When they much time in travailes spent,
Through diverse Nations went;
14.
All those that wronged them He removed,
And Kings for them reproved.
15.
To whom He said (by His command
That none should them withstand;)
Against mine Anointed lift no arm,
Nor do my Prophets harm.
16.
A famine through the land He spread,
Which brake their staff of bread.
17.
Yet He by Joseph had decreed
He would His people feed:
18.
Whose feet, when into bondage sold,
They did in fetters hold;
19.
Till God ordained his release,
And gave his trial ease.
20.
The King sent, from Captivity
To loose, and set him free.
21.
He made him all His house command,
Chief Ruler of the Land.
22.
Yea he such Sov'raigne power resigned,
He might his Princes bind:
And, tutored by His counsels wise,
His Senators advise.
Second Part.
23.
Then Jacob into Egypt came,
A Sojourner in Ham,
24.
Where his increased people grows
Much stronger then their foes:
25.
Whose heart He turned their name to hate,
And use them with deceit:
26.
Till Moses for their succor sent,
With chosen Aaron went.
27.
They most prodigious wonders showed,
And signs in Hams abode:
28.
Where darkness, blacker then their nights,
In midst of noone affrights:
The foggs, and vapors Him obey,
By putting out the day.
29.
Fish in their waters turned to blood
Were smothered in the Flood.
30.
Now Egypt frogs abundant brings
In chambers of their Kings.
31.
He spoke, and swarms of Flies arise;
Their coasts are filled with Lice.
32.
For rain, He hail and tempest powers,
And flames of fire, for showers.
With storm their Vines and Fig Trees shook,
Through all their land were broke.
34.
Locusts, and caterpillars bred,
Not to be numbered,
35.
All herbs and fruits that could be found
Devoured on the ground.
36.
Their firstborn He through Egypt slew,
Their chiefest strength orethrew.
37.
But brought His People forth with wealth,
Not one decayed in health.
38.
Egypt was glad and quit of fear,
When They departed were.
39.
Whose guide by day the cloud became,
And in the night a Flame.
40.
On quails His longing people fed,
From Heaven He gave them bread.
41.
He from the rock made waters flow,
Springs in dry places grow.
42.
To Abraham His promise made
He in remembrance had;
43.
He brought with joy His people thence,
Secured by His defense.
44.
And gave Them for their lot a soil
Enriched by others toil:
45.
That in His Statutes they might live.
To him all praises give.
PSALM. CVI.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
O Praise and thank our gracious God,
Whose mercy knows no period.
2.
Who can His mighty acts declare?
Or show how due His praises are?
3.
They blessed are who judge aright,
And always in the Truth delight.
4.
Lord think on me with Thine Elect;
Let Thy salvation me protect.
5.
Me to Thy Chosen's joys advance,
The bliss of Thine inheritance.
6.
Our sins with sorrow we confess,
Who, like our Fathers, still transgress.
7.
Thy works in Egypt they forgot,
Thy mercies there remembered not:
But at the Sea did Him provoke,
8.
Who yet their safety not forsook.
9.
The Red Sea he rebuked, and dried,
Whose waters walled them on each side.
And through its depths uncovered,
As safe, as through the desert, led:
10.
Saved them from foes that did pursue;
11.
All which the waters overthrew.
12.
Then they believed, and praises gave;
13.
Though soon forgot, who them did save.
14.
They lusted in the wilderness,
And God by their temptations press;
15.
Who was to their request attent;
Into their souls though Ieannes sent.
16.
They Moses in the Camp envied,
And Aaron's office vilify'd.
17.
For which earth opened to devour
Abiram's Troops, and Dathan's power.
18.
Then kindled was a furious fire,
Which burnt up those that did conspire.
19.
Their hands a Calfe in Horeb made;
And to the Molten Image prayed.
20.
His glory thus who them releast
Was now converted to a beast.
21.
And Egypts wonders, the Red Sea,
22.
Or Land of Ham, forgotten be.
23.
Then God, He would destroy them, said;
Till Moses intercession made:
Who in the deadly breach did stand,
To turn away His vengfull hand.
24.
His promised Land they now despise,
25.
And murmurs in their tents arise:
26.
That in the Desert He decreed,
27.
To scatter them, and all their seed.
Second Part.
28.
To Baal Peor joined, they fed
On sacrifices to the dead.
29.
Still their inventions Him provoke;
For which the Plague upon them broke.
30.
Then Phinchas avenged the offense,
And staid the mortal pestilence:
31.
Which all successions held a seal
Of righteousness, and holy zeal.
32.
Then at the waters where they strove,
They did again His anger move:
Where it so ill with Moses went,
He suffered in their punishment.
33.
Because his spirit, meek and mild,
Provoked was, whilst they reviled:
And discontented for their sake,
Some unadvised language spoke.
34.
The sinful Nations of the Land
They not destroyed at Gods command:
35.
But learned their rites, with heathens mixed;
36.
Ensnared, while on their Idols fixed.
37.
As gifts to Devils offered,
Their Sons, and daughters blood they shed:
38.
Whose guiltless lives to Idols slain
Did all the Land of Canaan stain.
39.
Thus they defiled a whoring went,
In impious works themselves invent.
40.
Therefore the Lords enkindled rage
Abhorred His own heritage.
41.
He gave Them up to Heathen powers;
Their haters made Their conquerours:
42.
Oppressed they were, by foes subdued;
43.
Yet saved, as often their sins renewed.
44
But hearing their afflicted Cry,
He pitty'd their calamity.
45.
He most compassionate, and kind,
His Covenant recalled to mind,
And in his mercy did repent
The sharpnes of their punishment.
46.
He made even those with pity look,
Who Them before had captives took.
47.
Save us, O Lord our God! protect,
And from the Heathen us collect:
To thank thy Name through all our days,
And triumph in Thy mercies praise.
48.
O let the God of Israel
Be blessed, whose benefits excel.
To Him be praises endless paid:
And let Amen by all be said.
PSALM. CVII.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
O Thank the goodness of our God,
Whose mercy knows no period.
2.
Let Israel confess, His hands
3.
Have gathered them from foreign lands:
From North, and South, and East, and West,
4.
Where they no City had to rest:
But in the wilderness dispersed,
5.
With hunger pined, and faint with thirst.
6.
Then they their Cries to God address,
Who them delivered from distress.
7.
He them directed in his way,
To find a City for their stay.
8.
O then that men would praise the Lord,
Who such great goodness does afford:
Recording both by tongue and pen
His wonders to the sons of men.
9.
The longing soul He satiates still,
The hungry does with goodness fill,
10.
Who sit in darkness, and death's shade,
In iron and affliction laid.
11.
Because against God they did rebel,
And from His words, and counsel fell,
12.
Therefore their heart by labors broke
Found none to ease them from their yoke.
13.
Then they their cries to God address,
Who them delivered from distress:
14
He them from death and darkness brought,
And freedom from their bondage wrought.
15.
O then that men would praise the Lord,
Who such great goodness does afford;
Recording both by tongue and pen
His wonders to the Sons of men.
16.
For He the gates of brass has broke,
The iron bars in sunder struck.
17.
The foolish for their acted sin
Have by His hand afflicted bin.
18.
So that their soul in sickness cast,
Abhorring meat, could nothing taste.
19.
Then they their cries to God address;
Who them delivered from distress.
20.
His word He sent them, which revealed,
Their sorrows, and dejections healed.
21.
O then that men would praise the Lord,
Who such great mercies does afford;
Recording both by tongue and pen
His wonders to the Sons of men.
22.
And let their Songs of gladness rise,
To pay their thankful sacrifice.
Second Part.
23.
They that in ships their trafick keep,
24.
Behold Gods wonders in the deep.
25.
For he commands the storm to blow,
26.
Whose billows them to heaven throw:
Then down they fall, as if their graves
Were made beneath the gaping waves.
27.
They stagger to and fro, and reele,
And like a drunkard rowles the keele.
28.
Then they their cries to God address,
Who them delivers from distress:
29.
He calmes the storm, whose rage gives ore;
30.
And lands them on the wished shore.
31.
O then that men would praise the Lord,
Who such great goodness does afford;
Recording both by tongue and pen
His wonders to the Sons of men.
32.
In great assemblies bless his Name,
And amongst the Elders speak his fame:
33.
Who rivers like a desert dryes;
Makes parched sands, where springs did rise.
34.
He barren makes a fruitful ground,
For sins which in the Land abound.
35.
Then to a poole the desert brings,
And turns dry grounds to water springs.
36.
There He the hungry souls has filled,
That they may live, and Cities build:
37.
To plant the vine, and sow the field,
Which may her fruits with plenty yield.
38.
He multiplies, and gives them peace,
Their flocks not suffering to decrease.
39.
Again they few, when sinful, grow;
His punishments then brought them low.
40.
He mighty Princes put to scorn,
Makes them like wanderers forlorn.
41.
Yet sets He the poor on high,
And spreads like flocks his family.
42.
The righteous will rejoice to see,
When envies mouth shall stopped be.
43.
Who so is wise, will hence record
The loving kindness of the Lord.
PSALM. CVIII.
1.
O God my heart is fixed, and bent,
Prepared my intent.
I will Thy might in songs of praise,
And glorious ditties raise.
2.
Wake Psaltery, and harp awake,
The morning I will take;
3.
That through the world my early verse
Thy praises may disperse.
4.
Thy mercy 'bove the Heaven extends,
Thy truth the clouds transcends.
5.
Be Thou exalted 'bove the skies,
'Bove earth in glory rise.
6.
That Thy beloved still may be
From all invasion free;
Thy right hand in their safety rear,
And their petitions hear.
7.
God by his truth did often profess,
He would his servants bless.
I will divide fair Shechems soil,
And Succoths valley spoil.
8.
Manasseh, Gilead, both are mine,
In war shall Ephraim shine:
But Judah's Scepter all must aw,
And give my people Law.
9.
Moab shall be a dunghill grow'n,
Proud Edom overthrow'n.
Philistia's boasted triumphs shall
Be buried in her fall.
10.
Who me will to the City lead,
Fierce Edoms strength and head?
That I may break her fensed gate,
And trample on her state?
11.
O Thou my God, who cast'dst us off,
And made our force their scoff!
Wilt not Thou with our armies go,
To quell the insulting foe?
12.
From trouble save us once again;
For help of man is vain.
Through God we shall in battle rise,
And foil our enemies.
PSALM. CIX.
Sing this as the Lamentation.
1.
GOd of my praise! nor silent be,
Nor unattentive unto me.
2.
For wicked mouths me falsely wrong,
And wound me with their lying tongue.
3.
They compass me with words of hate,
And causeless vex me with debate.
4.
For all my friendship they are foes:
But I my grief in prayer disclose.
5.
My good with evil they requite,
And my affection pay with spite.
6.
Let wicked rulers him command,
And Satan stand at his right hand,
7.
Let him, when judged, receive his doom,
And let his prayer, his sin become.
8.
His days both few, and irksome make,
His office let another take.
9.
May fatherless his children live;
His wife forlorn, a widow grieve:
10.
Like vagrants let them want their bread;
And, where they beg it, not be fed.
11.
Let him be made extortions spoil,
And strangers reap his harvests toil.
12.
None him their pitties object make,
Nor on his seed compassion take.
13.
His name from earth, and Offspring blot,
In the succeeding age forgot.
14.
And ever let the Lord retain
His Fathers sin, and Mothers stain.
15
Still let them stand before His ey,
To cut from earth his memory:
16.
Who merciless the poor pursued,
And wounds of broken hearts renewed.
17.
Feel he those curses which he loved;
All blessings be from him removed.
18.
As curses clothed him round about,
So seize they him, within, without;
Like water through his bowels flowed,
Or oil into his bones bestowed:
19.
So let them cloth, and gird him fast,
Returning on himself at last.
20.
Thus let the Lord reward my foes,
Who to reproach my soul expose.
21.
But for the mercies of Thy Name,
Deliver me (O Lord) from shame.
22.
For I am poor, and pressed with need;
My wounded heart does inward bleed.
23.
I like the falling shadow go;
As puffs of wind the Locusts throw.
24.
My feeble knee through fasting fails,
And faintnes ore my flesh prevails:
25.
I am their scorn and laughter bred,
They looking on me shake their head.
26.
Help me (O Lord!) who mercy crave;
27.
That they may know, thy hand can save.
28.
Bless when they curse; their pride confou^d;
But let me live with gladness crowned.
29.
Lord! let my shamed enemy
In sharp confusion clothed ly.
30.
So shall Thy praises with my tongue
Be in the full assembly sung.
31.
For God will at the poor's right hand,
By His protection, ready stand;
To save his innocence from them,
Who wrongfully his soul condemn.
PSALM. CX.
1.
THe Lord, whose power all things does sway,
Unto my Lord did say:
Sit at my right hand, till thou see,
Thy foes Thy footstool be.
2.
The Lord Thy Scepter shall extend,
And strength from Sion send;
That all Thine enemies below
May to Thy Kingdom bow.
3.
The people in great numbers shall
That day before Thee fall;
Whose glorious Birth, and youthful hue
Is as the morning dew.
4.
The Lord has sworn, who not repents
His long decreed intents,
Thou do from great Melchisedek
Thy Royal Priesthood take.
5.
God at Thy right hand Kings shall wound,
And Nations strong confound:
6.
Whose countries shall be overspread
With Bodies of their dead.
7.
He of the River in the way
Shall drink, his thirst to stay:
And his victorious head advance
In our Deliverance.
PSALM. CXI.
To the usual Tune.
1.
PRaise God: with heart and tongue,
The Quire of Saints among,
His praises shall be sung.
2
The works of God are great;
All those will them repeat,
Whose thoughts on Him are set.
3.
His actions glorious are,
Renowned and honored far;
Nor can His truth empaire:
4.
His wonders fill our thought,
Who has compassion wrought;
And pity shows, when sought.
5.
He has His servants fed,
Given those, that fear Him, bread,
His Covenant stablished:
6.
His power to them expressed,
And made His people rest,
Where Heathen late possessed.
7.
What ever wrought His hands,
In truth and judgment stands,
And sure are His Commands:
8.
They all for ever last,
By His decree kept fast,
Till fleeting time is past.
9.
He did His people save,
Whom Tyrants did enslave;
His sacred Covenant gave:
Renowned is His fame,
And reverend His Name,
Which all the world proclaim.
10.
God's fear true wisdom brings;
The knowledge of good things
From that beginning springs.
They understand aright,
Who make His Laws their light,
And still His praise recite.
PSALM. CXII.
1.
Blessed is the man that fears the Lord,
Delighting in His word:
2.
His seed on earth shall mighty be,
Blessed his posterity.
3.
His house with riches shall abound,
His life with plenty crowned.
His righteous dealing, clear as sure,
For ever shall endure.
4.
In shades of darkness to the upright
There rises up a light.
He gracious is, and free from hate,
His heart compassionate.
5.
A good man mercy shows, and lends;
Nor in his words offends:
6.
He shall not move, but placed be
In lasting memory.
7.
He, of ill tidings not afraid,
Has God his refuge made:
Thus fixed, his heart shall never fail,
8.
But against his foes prevail.
9.
With liberal hand unto the poor
He has dispersed his store,
His righteousness shall still remain,
And lasting honor gain.
10.
The wicked man, when this he sees,
For spite shall gnash his teeth:
And, melted by his envies fire,
Perish in his desire.
PSALM. CXIII.
To the usual Tune.
1.
THe Lord O ye His servants praise,
To His great Name your ditties raise,
2.
Which blessed and sacred be always:
3.
Even from the rising of the Sun,
Till to the West his course be run,
Nis Name is to be praised alone.
4.
The Lord above all Nations high,
Is seated in great Majesty,
And in the Heavens His glories ly.
5.
What power created parallells
The Lord our God who thus excells,
And far above the Heaven dwells?
6.
Who humbling down himself does bow,
Not only things in heaven to know,
But what is done in earth below.
7.
To him that did in dust deplore,
He joyful comforts does restore;
And from the dunghill lifts the poor:
8.
That set with Princes of the earth,
And persons of a Royal birth,
His sorrows may be changed to mirth.
9.
The barren woman, when implored,
His bounty has with children stored:
O therefore praise this gracious Lord.
PSALM. CXIV.
1.
WHen Israel from Egypt went
Free from his banishment,
And Jacob came from that strange land,
Conducted by God's hand:
2.
The house of Judah, which did pass,
His Sanctuary was:
And Israel the chosen throne
Of His dominion.
3.
The Sea saw that, and did disperse,
Jordan his course reverse.
4.
The Mountains skip'd like sporting rams,
The little hills like Lambs.
5.
What ay'ld thy waters, O thou Sea,
That they so fled from thee?
Jordan, what did thy current lack,
That thou wast driven back?
What Miracle did then prevail,
That both your streams should fail?
6.
You Mountains, that ye skip'd like rams?
Yet little hills like Lambs?
7.
Tremble thou earth, when Jacobs God
Commands thee with his rod:
8.
Who from the Rock did waters bring,
And made the flint a spring.
PSALM. CXV.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
NOt unto us (O Lord!) but Thee,
Thy Name, Thy Truth, the glory be.
2.
Why should the heathen Thee defy,
Whilst, Where is now their God? they cry?
3.
Our God in heaven does remain,
And acts what ere he did ordain.
Their Idols Silver are, and Gold:
The work which hands of men did mould.
5.
Mouths have they, yet they speechless be;
And they have eyes, but cannot see:
6.
They ears possess, which nothing hear;
And noses, not for smelling, bear.
7.
Their hands not touch, their feet not walk;
Nor through their throat resounds their talk.
8.
Who make them are as vain as they;
And so are all that to them pray.
9. 10.
O Israel! O Aarons line!
11.
O ye that in His fear combine!
Trust ye in God, who is your shield;
Protection He, and help does yield.
12.
He, mindful still of our redress,
Will Israel, and Aaron bless.
13.
Who fear Him, small or great, are blessed,
14.
And in their race shall be encreast.
15.
You are the blessed of the Lord,
Who heaven framed, and earth has stored:
16.
He in the Heaven of Heavens lives,
But earth unto man's children gives.
17.
The dead Thy praises cannot show,
Nor those who down to silence go:
18.
But we the Lord through all our days
Will bless. The Lord for ever praise.
PSALM. CXVI.
1.
I Love the Lord, and am well pleased,
He has me heard, and eased.
2.
Whilst therefore life continue shall,
I will upon Him call.
3.
The snares of death about me dwelt,
And pains of Hell I felt.
Disturbed thoughts, and heaviness
My conscience did oppress.
4.
Then to the Lord my plaint I made,
And thus unto Him said:
O Lord! my soul from falling save,
And lift me from the grave.
5.
The Lord is gracious, and just,
To those His mercy trust:
6.
His Hand the simple does protect,
When crosses them deject.
7.
Turn then my soul unto thy rest;
God's favors have thee blessed.
He bountifully does reward,
And thee from dangers guard.
8.
Thou keep'st my soul from death's pale fears,
My drooping eyes from tears,
And did my wandering steps recall,
When I was apt to fall.
9.
My feet before the Lord shall stand
In His eternal land.
10.
I therefore prayed, and thus believed;
Yet still my heart was grieved.
For in my foes success I failed,
Till faith at last prevailed:
11.
Then I all men for Liars knew,
And God alone for true.
12.
What retribution shall I give
To him by whom I live?
Or what acknowledgment apply,
For His benignity?
13.
Salvations sacred Cup I Will take,
And humble prayers make.
14.
Before His people shall be paid
The vows which I have made.
15.
For those that live like Saints upright,
And in the Lord delight,
Are living dear unto His eye,
And precious when they die.
16.
Lord I Thy faithful servant am,
And still adore Thy Name.
Thou loosed have my heavy yoke,
My bonds in sunder broke.
17.
Therefore my praises unto Thee
Shall daily offered be:
My gratitude and prayer shall rise,
Like thankful sacrifice.
18.
The vows shall be, which I have made,
Before the people paid,
19.
Who in Thy house and sacred Courts
To praise Thy Name resorts.
PSALM. CXVII.
1.
O All ye Nations record,
The Praises of the Lord;
Ye people through the Universe,
Your Makers praise rehearse.
2.
For He to us great kindness shows,
And Mercies large bestows.
His constant Truth no time decaies:
The Lord for ever praise.
PSALM. CXVIII.
1.
O Thank the goodness of our God,
Whose mercy knows no period.
2.
Let Israel their voices join;
3.
Let those who come from Aarons loyne,
4.
Let all who fear the Lord confess
His mercies everlastingnesse.
5.
I called upon Him, when distressed;
Who me enlarged, and releast.
6
The Lord Himself is on my side;
I fearlesse man's attempts abide.
7
He takes their part who succor me:
I shall my haters ruined see.
8.
It Is bettet in the Lord to trust,
Than lean on man, who is but dust:
9.
Better rely on His defense,
Then put in Princes confidence.
10.
All Nations me encompassed round;
But His great Name shall them confound:
11.
They closely set against me came,
But I destroyed them in His Name.
12.
Like bees they thick about me swarmed,
Yet through His Name I was unharm'd:
As kindled Thorns, which blazing die,
They quenched in their ashes ly.
13.
Though pressing foes my fall assayed,
The Lord Himself became may aid:
14.
God is my health, my strength, my song:
15.
Loud joys the Righteous are among.
16.
For God's Right hand's lift up on high,
His Right hand acts most valiantly.
17.
I shall not die, but live to praise,
And speak His wonders all my days.
18.
Although the Lord me chast'ned sore,
He unto death not gave me ore.
19.
Open His sacred Gates, that I
With praise the Lord may glorify.
20.
This is the Gate, through which the just
And righteous Persons enter must.
21.
Thee will I thank, who heard'st my voice,
And make me in Thy help rejoice.
22.
That stone the builders from them laid,
The Head is of the Corner made.
23.
This is Gods act; which in our eyes
Religious wonder multiplies:
24.
This is the day the Lord has made,
We will rejoice, in it be glad.
25.
Save now, and prosper we entreat,
O Lord! who art as good, as great.
26.
He blessed be, comes in His Name;
We blessings from God's house proclaim.
27.
God is the Lord* whose light has shined;
Pure Offerings to His Altar bind.
28.
Thou art my God, I Thee will praise,
And in my Song Thine honor raise.
O thank the goodness of our God,
Whose mercy knows no period.
PSALM. CXIX.
ALEPH.
1.
BLessed are They, who undefiled,
Nor in their ways beguiled,
2.
God's Laws obey, His statutes keep,
And with their whole heart seek.
3.
No wicked act seduced them has,
Or turned them from His path;
4.
For Thou command'st, that from Thy Law
We never should withdraw.
5.
O that my ways were so upright,
I keep Thy statutes might:
6.
Thou will not me with shame reject,
Who Thy commands respect.
7.
My heart to praise Thee will delight,
When taught Thy judgments right:
8.
Thy statutes I my rule will make;
O never me forsake.
BETH.
9.
How shall a young man cleanse his way?
Nere from Thy word to stray.
10.
My heart does seek, and Thee prefer;
Let not my goings err.
11.
Thy word I hid my heart within,
To keep me free from sin.
12.
Blessed art Thou, O Gracious Lord;
Teach me to do Thy word.
13.
My lips desist not to declare,
How just Thy judgments are:
14.
Thy testimonies make me glad,
Above all riches had.
15.
I will Thy precepts meditate,
And to Thy ways relate.
16.
Thy statutes are my chief delight,
Kept in my mind, and sight.
GIMEL.
17.
Deal well with me, that whilst I live,
I may observance give:
18.
Discover to my opened eyes
Thy Law's high mysteries.
19.
A stranger I on earth abide;
Thy precepts do not hide.
20.
My fainting soul, with longing tired,
Thy judgments has desired.
21.
With curses Thou the proud have struck,
Who Thy Commands forsook.
22.
Reproach, and scorn from me remove;
For I Thy precepts love.
23.
Princes did sit, and against me speak,
But I Thy statutes seek.
24.
Thy word my only joy I make,
And from It counsel take.
DALETH.
25.
My soul unto the dust does cleave;
Yet me in death not leave.
26.
I to Thine ear my ways reveal,
Thy statutes not conceal.
27.
Inform me in Thy precepts well,
That I Thy works may tell.
28.
My melting soul with grief does wast;
O quicken me at last.
29.
Remove from me the way of lies,
That l Thy Law may prize.
30.
The ways of Truth my Soul does choose;
Thy judgments I propose.
31.
Thy testimonies are my aim;
Lord put me not to shame:
32.
Who from Thy Law will nere depart,
When Thou enform'st my heart.
HE.
33.
Teach me Thy statutes to intend,
And keep them to the end.
34.
Informed, I shall Thy Laws each part
Observe with my whole heart:
35.
Guide me in Thy commands aright,
For theirein I delight.
36.
My heart unto Thy Laws divine,
Not avarice, incline.
37.
Quicken Thou me, and turn mine eye
From seeing vanity.
38.
Thy word establish in my ear,
Devoted to Thy fear.
39.
Remove my feared reproaches far,
For good Thy judgments are:
40.
And me, Thy precepts who desire,
With quickening grace inspire.
VAV.
41.
Thy saving mercies grant me Lord,
According to Thy word.
42.
So shall I answer scorns unjust,
Because in Thee I trust.
43.
Thy Truth from out my mouth nere take,
Who it my comfort make.
44.
So I Thy Law, and holy will,
For ever shall fulfill.
45.
Enlarged I walk at liberty,
Thy precepts to descry:
46.
Which, daunted nor with fear, nor shame,
I will to Kings proclaim.
47.
On Thy Commands my love I place,
And joyfully embrace:
48.
With lifted hands, and heart, prostrate
On these I meditate.
ZAIN.
49.
Remember Lord! Thy promise made,
Wherein my hope is laid:
50.
This quickens me, though dead with grief,
In trouble gives releif.
51.
Thy Law, though proud men me deride,
I never have denied:
52.
Thy judgments old I called to mind,
And present comfort find.
53.
Horror and trembling me surprise,
When sinners Thee despise.
54.
I sing Thy statutes all my age,
In life's short pilgrimage.
55.
Thy name at night comes to my thought,
Who have Thy precepts sought.
56.
This comfort I performed saw,
Because I kept Thy Law.
CHETH.
57.
Thou art my Lot; I said, (O Lord!)
That I would keep Thy word.
58.
With my whole heart I favor crave;
Let me Thy mercy have.
59.
My ways I marked, and turned my feet,
Within Thy Rules to meet.
60.
To keep Thy statutes have I made,
With duty, not delayed.
61.
By wicked bands though robbed, and spoiled,
I nere from Thee recoyl'd.
62.
At midnight I my self will raise,
To sing Thy Judgments praise.
63.
I am their friend, and hold them dear,
Who Thee obey, and fear.
64.
Through earth (O Lord) Thy mercies reach;
Me in Thy statutes teach.
TETH.
65.
Thoust have dealt well with me, O Lord!
According to Thy word.
66.
Good judgment and true knowledge give,
For I Thy Laws believe.
67.
Before I troubled was, I strayed;
But now Thy word obeyed:
68
All good does from Thy bounty flow;
Let me Thy statutes know.
69.
The proud by Lies would me supplant,
Who keep Thy Covenant:
70.
Their heart is swollen with fat, and ease;
But me Thy statutes please.
71.
It Is good, that by affliction taught,
To know Thee I am brought;
72.
Whose Law I in more value hold
Then thousand heaps of Gold.
IOD.
73.
I have been fashioned by Thy hand;
Teach me to understand:
74
Who fear Thee shall be glad to see
My settled hope in Thee.
75.
I know Thy judgments (Lord) are true;
And my affliction due.
76.
Yet let Thy comfort, I Thee pray,
Thy servants grief allay.
77.
In tender mercy me forgive,
That I with Thee may live.
78.
Shame them, whose pride without a cause,
Hates me, who love Thy Laws.
79.
Let those conjoined to me be near;
Thy truth who know, and fear;
80.
My heart keep in Thy statutes sound,
That me no shame confound.
CAPH.
81.
My soul, for Thy salvation faint,
Trusts on Thy gracious grant.
82.
Mine eyes with expectation fail;
When shall my hopes prevail?
83.
Though like a bottle in the smoke,
Yet Thee I not forsook*
84.
Shall my short days of life have end,
Ere Thou Thy judgment send?
85.
The proud for me against all right
Have dug pits in spite:
86.
As Thou art faithful, send redress,
Against them who me oppress.
87.
They me on earth almost consumed;
But I on Thee presumed.
88.
O quicken me, as Thou art kind,
So I Thy word shall mind.
LAMED.
89.
Thy promise (Lord) does ever last,
In heaven settled fast:
90.
Thy faith, through all successions tried,
Does fixed as earth abide:
91.
Thou for Thy service did ordain,
That all things should remain.
92.
But that Thy Law was my releif,
I perished had through grief.
93.
Thy precepts in my thought shall live,
For they my soul revive.
94.
Save me (O Lord!) for I am Thine,
And to Thy Law incline.
95.
Though wicked men would me destroy,
I make Thy word my joy:
96.
Which to eternal bliss extends,
When earth's perfection ends.
MEM.
97.
Thy Law how dearly do I rate
All day to meditate?
98.
Which still before me, makes me wise,
Above mine enemies.
99.
For studying this, I knowledge have,
More then my teachers gave.
100.
I understand more then the old,
'Cause I Thy precepts hold.
101.
My feet from evil ways refrained,
Are by Thy word restrained:
102.
I from Thy judgments not depart;
For Thou have taught my heart.
103.
Then honey bred from flowery fields,
Thy word more sweetness yields.
104.
Through this I understanding gat;
And ways of falsehood hate.
NVN.
105.
Thy word a lamp is shining bright,
And to my path a light.
106.
I in my solemn vows have sworn,
Thy statutes to perform.
107.
I ly perplexed with grief and pain;
Lord! quicken me again.
108.
O let my Prayers Thy audience reach,
And me Thy judgments teach.
109.
My soul, though death and dangers threat,
Can never Thee forget:
110.
And though the wicked snares have laid,
From Thee I never strayed.
111.
Thy statutes are my chosen part,
The comfort of my heart;
112.
And to perform Them I intend,
Until my life shall end.
SAMECH.
113.
I hate vain thoughts, ill men neglect:
But I Thy Law affect.
114.
Thou art my refuge and my shield,
Whose word does safety yield.
115.
Depart ye wicked ones away;
I will my God obey:
116.
Uphold me in a life unblam'd,
Nor let my hope be shamed.
117.
Sustain me (Lord!) so shall my faith,
Resting on Thee, be safe.
118.
Thou tread'st them down, whose guilefull heart
Does from Thy Laws depart;
119.
And, like the dross that is cast away,
Make them on earth decay.
120.
My trembling flesh is full of fear,
When I these judgments hear.
AIN.
121.
Lord! leave me not, who love the right,
To my oppressors might:
122.
Be Thou my surety against their pride,
Who have my ways decry'd.
123.
Mine eyes for Thy salvation fail,
Until my hopes prevail.
124.
In mercy with Thy servant deal;
Thy statutes (Lord!) reveal.
125.
Give me an understanding heart;
Thy sacred will impart:
126.
It Is time for Thee to bring Thy aid,
For void Thy Law is made.
127.
I Thy Commandments pr^tious hold,
Above refined gold:
128
And all Thy precepts justly prize;
But hate deceit and lies.
PE.
129
Thy testimonies wondrous are,
My souls delight and care:
130.
Thy words like beams of light arise,
To make the simple wise.
131.
Panting, and breathless in desire,
I to Thy laws aspire:
132.
Such mercy (Lord) upon me power,
As those who Thee adore.
133.
Order my steps, no sins may stain,
Nor vices over me reign.
134
From man's oppression me redeem,
Thy precepts who esteem.
135.
Make Thy blessed face on me to shine;
Teach me Thy Laws divine:
136.
Rivers of Tears run down mine eyes,
When men Thy Law despise.
TSADDI.
137.
Thou righteous art, (O Lord) my might,
Thy judgments are upright.
138.
The Statutes which Thou do command,
Unchanged and faithful stand.
139.
My zeal consumes me, when I find
Thy Law not kept in mind.
140.
Thy word is very pure, and tried,
By me most magnified.
141.
I, though despised and lightly set,
Thy precepts not forget:
142.
Thy righteousness no period knew,
And Thy Commands are true.
143.
Though troubles me, or anguish seize,
Yet I delight in these:
144.
Lord! in Thy statutes knowledge give,
And I shall ever live.
COPH.
145.
I cried with my whole heart! Lord hear,
Through whom I persevere.
146.
O save me, when to Thee I call;
So keep Thy Laws I shall.
147.
My cries prevent the dawning light;
148.
My eyes outwatch the night:
That I Thy word might meditate,
My hope, and safe Retreit.
149.
O Lord my voice in mercy hear,
Me quicken in Thy fear.
150.
Men bent to mischief nigh me draw,
Contemners of thy Law:
151.
Yet Thou O Lord art near at hand,
And true is Thy command.
152.
For on eternal bases placed,
Thy testimonies last.
RESCH.
153.
Consider me in my distress:
For I Thy Law confess.
154.
Plead Thou my cause, and life afford,
According to Thy word.
155.
Salvation far from sinners flies;
For they Thy Laws despise.
156.
Thy tender mercies (Lord) exceed:
O quicken me with speed.
157.
Though many foes against me combine,
From Thee I not decline.
158.
With sorrow I transgressors saw,
Who have not kept Thy Law.
159.
Lord! think how I Thy precepts love:
Inspire me from above.
160.
Thy word is true, Thy Judgments pure,
And ever shall endure.
SCHIN.
161.
Princes pursue me without cause;
Yet still I fear Thy Laws:
162.
Whose sacred word more glads my mind,
Then those that treasures find.
163.
I falsehood hate, abhor all lies;
But Thy Commandments prize.
164.
Sev'n times each day my tongue displayes
Thy righteous judgments praise.
165.
Great peace have those Thy Law attend,
Nothing shall them offend.
166.
Lord! I in Thy salvation hope,
And make Thy will my scope.
167.
My soul Thy testimonies loves,
And them 'bove all approves;
168.
And constantly Thy Law obeyes,
Who searchest all my ways.
TAV.
169.
Accept (O Lord) my loud complaint,
And knowledge to me grant.
170.
Let my request admission crave,
And in Thy promise save.
171.
So shall my lips Thy praises reach,
When Thou my heart do teach:
172.
My tongue Thy statutes shall recite:
For Thy commands are right.
173.
O let Thine hand bring help to me,
Whose choice Thy precepts be.
174.
My thoughts for Thy salvation long,
My chiefest joys among.
175.
Let my soul live Thy Name to praise,
Whose judgments me shall raise:
I like a lost sheep went astray;
O Lord my wand'rings stay.
PSALM. CXX.
1.
WIth troubles pressed, and drowned in grief,
I called for relief:
When God unto my help appeared,
And my Petition heard.
2.
Lord save me from their cruel lies,
Who would my life surprise.
Make not my soul their envies bait,
To perish by deceit.
3.
What vengeance does to Thee belong,
O false and perjured tongue?
4.
Sharp arrows, and a quenchlesse fire,
Shall one day be thy hire.
5.
Woe unto me, constrained to dwell
So far from Israel;
That I in Mesech sojourne must,
And Tents of Kedar trust.
6.
My Soul this long time does converse
With dispositions fierce:
Who shunned have, like some disease,
The happy fruits of peace.
7.
To quench wars flame, and lessen strife,
I labored all my life:
But They, when Treaties were my care,
For lasting war prepare.
PSALM. CXXI.
Sing this as the Prayer after the Commandments.
1.
UP to the Hills I lift mine eyes,
From whence my help and comfort rise.
2.
My safety from the Lord does spring,
Who made the world, and every thing.
3.
Thy foot from falling He protects,
Nor Slumbers He, nor thee neglects.
4.
Behold, that Lord who Israel keeps,
Unwearied is, and never sleeps.
5.
God is thy Keeper, like a shade
Which on thy right hand is displayed.
6.
The Sun by day thee shall not smite,
Nor vapors of the Moon by night.
7.
The Lord shall Thee preserve from harm;
Thy soul against temptations arm.
8.
Thy going out, and coming in
For evermore His care have bin.
PSALM. CXXII.
1.
I Was right glad, and joyful made
When They unto me said;
Let us unto God's House repair,
And worship Him with prayer.
2.
Oblest Jerusalem! our feet
Within Thy Gates shall meet;
3.
Who builded like a City art,
United in each part.
4.
To Thee the Tribes of God ascend,
Their praises to commend;
And by their zeal the rest inflame,
To bless their Makers Name.
5.
There are the great Tribunals placed,
By public justice graced.
There is the Palace and the Throne,
Which David sits upon.
6.
O pray for Salems lasting peace,
That it may nere decrease:
They still shall prosper, from whose love
These happy wishes move.
7.
With peace thy walls encircled be,
Sweet concord dwell in Thee:
And let thy Palaces abound,
With fullest plenty crowned.
8.
I for my brethrens sake will pray,
Peace may within thee stay.
9.
And for the House of Gods abode
Will ever seek Thy good.
PSALM. CXXIII.
1.
I Unto Thee lift up mine eyes,
O thou who rul'st the skies,
And in the highest Heavens do dwell,
Whose brightness none can tell.
2.
As servants wait their Lords command,
And Maids their mistress hand:
On God so do our eyes depend
Till He his mercy send.
3.
O Lord! some pity on us show,
To end our painful woe.
For we reproached, and unpriz'd,
Are utterly despised.
4.
Our soul afflicted daily mournes,
Filled with excessive scorns.
Whilst those who live in ease, and pride,
Our wretched state deride.
PSALM. CXXIV.
To the proper Tune.
1.
NOw Israel
This truth may gladly tell:
But that the Lord
Did help to us afford;
2
If He our side
With strength had not supplied,
When banding foes
Against our safety rose,
3.
Their kindled ire
Had swallowed us like fire.
4.
The angry flood
Had then above us stood,
Who by the stream
Quite overwhelmed had been;
5.
And swelling waves
Become our timeless graves:
Whilst ore our soul
The billows proudly roll.
6.
Blessed be His aid,
Who us their prey not made.
7.
Our resku'd souls,
Like late-entangled fowls,
Escaped are
Out of the deadly snare:
Broke is the net,
And we at freedom set.
8.
In His great Name,
Who Heaven and earth did frame,
Our ruin stayed,
And help on Him is laid.
Another of the same.
1.
NOw Israel may truly say,
In honor of this day;
Had not the Lord our quarrel took*
All help had us forsook.
2.
Yea had not God our battles fought,
When men our ruin sought;
And when our close conspiring foes*
Against our safety rose;
3.
The wrath, which in their breasts did strive,
Had buried us alive;
Consuming both our Place and Name
In their revenges flame.
4.
Our Life, and what we most esteem,
Had perished in this stream;
5.
And in the furious billows womb,
Beheld our glories tomb.
6.
But let our God be always praised,
Who thus from death us raised:
Nor made us subject to their power,
Who sought us to devour.
7.
From danger resku'd is our soul,
Like some net-scaping foul:
So broken is the bloody snare,
And we delivered are.
8.
Our present help, and hopes of aid
In God alone are laid;
It Is He, who made both Heaven and earth,
That gave our comforts birth.
PSALM. CXXV.
1.
WHo God their hope and trust account,
Are like fair Sions Mount;
Whose head unmoved, and unshook,
Abides the tempests stroke.
2.
As rising Mountains Salem's fense,
By their circumference;
So God His people guards throughout,
And circles them about.
3.
The wicked shall not by their power
The righteous Lot devour;
Least they the heathens sins partake,
Who them their vassal make.
4
Do good O Lord unto the just,
Who in Thy goodness trust.
And those that are in heart upright,
Continue in Thy sight.
5.
But as for such who turned aside,
To crooked ways back-slide,
The Lord their judgments shall increase;
But Jacob bless with peace.
PSALM. CXXVI.
1.
WHen God did cast a gracious eye
On Sions misery;
And did his captived Peoples state
To liberty translate;
This unexpected safety wrought
On us such wonder brought,
Our freedom like a vision seemed,
And we like them that dreamed.
2.
Joy filled our mouth, triumphant Songs
Did exercise our tongues,
That Heathens with amazement said,
God has This gladness made
3.
The Lord, who crowns His servants faith
Great things effected has,
And makes us publish through the earth.
The causes of our mirth.
4.
Lord! turn our bondage, end our woe,
Let Thy full me cyes flow,
As waters from the fountains mouth,
Or Rivers in the South.
5.
They who, before in tears have sow'n,
And only sorrows known;
Shall so their future hopes employ,
That they may reap in joy.
6.
He who good seed in weeping bears,
And watered with his tears*
Shall doubtless find returned with gain;
What here he sowed in pain.
A blessed harvest shall ensue,
His comforts to renew;
Long joys shall spring from his short grief,
And from each grain a sheaf.
PSALM. CXXVII.
Sing this as the Lords Prayer.
1.
EXcept the Lord the house sustain,
The builders labor is in vain;
Except the City He defend.
And to the dwellers safety send,
In vain are Sentinels prepared,
Or armed watchmen for the guard.
2.
You vainly with the early light
Arise, or sit up late at night,
To find support, and daily eat
Your bread with sorrow earned and sweat:
When God, who His beloved keeps,
This plenty gives with quiet sleeps.
3.
Lo! children, and the fruitful womb,
Are blessings which from Heaven come,
4.
As arrows in a strong man's hand,
So children are in youth obtained;
5.
Who has his quiver full of those
Shall never fear upbraiding foes.
PSALM. CXXVIII.
1.
BLessed is he who God does fear,
And holds His precepts dear:
2.
Thou shall have plenty in thy meat,
And of thy labors eat.
3.
Thy Wife shall, like the loving vine,
Which does thy walls entwine,
With fruits enrich thy dwelling place,
And multiply thy race.
Thy Children shall like branches show,
Which from the Olive grow,
And round about thy table stand,
As blessings to thy land.
4.
These favors shall the man obtain,
Whose hopes in God remain:
5.
The Lord shall thee from Sion bless,
With all earthes happiness.
Thine eyes Jerusalem shall see,
Filled with prosperity,
And whilst thy days of life endure,
Her gloryes shall be sure.
6.
Thou Childrens Children shall behold,
Spring up when thou art old,
And added to thine own increase,
See Israel in peace.
PSALM. CXXIX.
Sing this as Psalm 119.
1.
Often vexed me from my Youth have they,
May Israel now say,
2.
Often in my tender years assaild;
Yet have they not prevailed.
3.
My back the plowers did invade,
And there long furrows made:
4.
But God has cut their wicked bands,
And saved me from their hands.
5.
Let them confounded back retire,
Who Sions hurt desire;
6.
Or prove like grass on houses top,
Which withers e're grown up:
7.
Which has no mower for it found,
Nor into sheaves is bound;
8.
And none that pass, God speed you, say,
Or wish you prosper may.
PSALM. CXXX.
1.
OUt from the Depths of misery,
O Lord! to Thee I cry:
2.
Mark well my voice, and let Thine ear
My supplication hear.
3.
If Thou, O Lord! wilt be extreme,
And with thy searching beam
Examine each transgression,
And error we have done:
When we thus strictly shall be tried,
Who may thy sentence bide?
Or who endure thy vengfull hand,
And in thy judgment stand?
4.
But there is Mercy (Lord) with Thee,
That Thou may feared be:
5.
Thy word and Promises are just,
Therefore in them I trust.
6.
On Thee alone my hope is placed,
To Thee my Soul does have:
On Thee she waits, to Thee she flies,
Before the morning rise.
They that expect the morning light,
After the weary night,
Watch not so much the break of day,
As she for Thee does stay.
7.
O Israel trust in the Lord,
Who pity does afford!
For He more ready is to save,
Then we his help to crave.
With Him abundant mercy is,
To salve what is done amiss:
8.
And Plentiful redemption found,
To cure each sinful wound.
Another of the same, paraphrased for an Antheme.
OUt of the horror of the lowest Deep,
Where cares and endless fears their station keep,
To th^e (O Lord) I send my woeful cry:
O hear the accents of my misery.
If Thy enquiry (Lord) should be severe,
To mark all sins which have been acted here,
Who may abide? or, when they sifted are,
Stand un-condemned at Thy Judgments bar?
But there is mercy (O my God) with Thee,
That Thou by it may loved, and feared be.
My Soul waits for the Lord, in Him I trust,
Whose word is faithful, and whose promise just.
On him my longing thoughts are fixed, as they,
Who wait the co^forts of the rising day:
Yea more then those that watch the morning light
Tired with the sorrows of a rest-less night.
O Israel, trust in that Gracious Lord,
Who plentiful remission does afford;
And will His people, who past pardon seem,
By mercyes greater then their sins redeem,
PSALM. CXXXI.
1.
O Lord! I have no haughty mind,
Nor eyes to pride inclined.
To matters great I not aspire,
Nor things too high desire.
2.
But Iow in thought, in action mild,
Like to a weaned Child,
So weaned from all earth's vanities
My soul on Thee relies.
3.
Let Israel make God their scope,
And in His goodness hope;
Until both time, and life shall end,
On Him alone depend.
PSALM. CXXXII.
1.
REmember David's trouble Lord,
His vow and oath record;
2.
How he in zeal, and holy fear,
To Jacob's God did swear.
3.
I will not house my weary head,
Nor go into my bed,
4.
Nor shall my eyes, with sleep oppressed,
Acquainted be with rest:
5.
Until a dwelling place I find
Unto the Lord designed:
And till I shall a Temple raise
For the Almighty's praise.
6.
Lo, we have heard, in Ephrata
Thy Arc did sometimes stay;
And found, in open fields it stood,
Or shelt'red by the wood.
7.
But in His Tabernacle now
Our knees we will humbly bow:
We will before His foot stool fall,
And on His power call.
8.
Arise (O Lord!) into Thy Rest,
Long with Thy presence blessed;
And let Thy Arc be fixed here,
Whose strength the Nations fear.
9.
Thy Priests with holiness attire,
With joy Thy Saints inspire:
10.
Do not Thy love for David's sake,
From Thine Anointed take.
11.
The Lord to David vowed has,
Nor will He break His faith,
From thine own loins shall issue one
To sit upon thy throne.
12
And if thy Children will consent
To my Commandment;
Their sons, whilst day and night remain,
Successively shall Reign.
13.
For I the Lord have Sion chose
For my desired repose:
14.
Within this dwelling will I rest,
An everlasting guest.
15.
Her stores with plenty shall be fed,
Her poor relieved with bread:
16.
Her Priests with blessing shall be decked,
With gladness Her Elect.
17.
There shall the Horn of David spring,
In honor flourishing:
And like a Lamp, his glorious light
Shall still continue bright.
18.
His adversaries, clothed with shame,
Shall lose both life and name:
But from his Sacred Head the Crown
Shall never be cast down.
PSALM. CXXXIII.
1.
BEhold how pleasant it is to see,
When brethren do agree:
Whose hea^ts, as dwellings, love unites,
And to accord invites.
2
It Is like the precious ointment shed
On A^rons sacred head,
Which did from face, and beard descend,
And on his garment end.
3.
It Is as the silver drops of dew
Which Hermons top renew:
Or as the fuitfull raines distill
Upon fair Sions Hill.
4.
The Lord on such agreement powers
His loves unwasted showers;
And does their habitations bless
With endless happiness
PSALM. CXXXIV.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
YE servants of the Lord!
Bless Him with one accord.
You in His House who nightly wait,
His praises due relate.
2.
With lifted hands adore,
And daily Him implore:
Within His Sanctuary bless
The Lord of Holiness.
3
The God that Heaven made,
And earth's foundation laid,
Out of His Sion thee defend,
And blessings endless send.
PSALM. CXXXV.
Sing this as Psalm 119.
1.
PRaise ye the Lord; His praise proclaim
All ye that love His Name.
2.
Ye in His House, and Courts that stand,
Attending His Command.
3.
O praise His goodness, bless His Name,
From whom all mercies came.
4.
He Jacob chose, and on his race
Did all His treasure place.
5.
Our God is great, and in His deeds
All other Gods exceeds:
6.
In Heaven, or earth, or deepest Seas,
He acts what ere He please.
7.
He makes from earth the vapors rise,
Which cloud the dark'ned skies:
From whence He raines, and lightning flings,
And winds there treasured brings.
8.
He man and beast in Egypt smote,
9.
And plagues on Pharaoh brought.
10.
His arm did vanquish Nations great,
And mighty Kings defeat:
11.
Sihon, and Og, and Canaan fell
12.
In lot to Israel.
13.
Therefore Thy powerful Name, O Lord,
Succession shall record.
14.
Thy judgments are on sinners bent;
But toward Thine own relent.
15.
The Gods in Heathen Temples sought,
Are gold and silver wrought.
16.
Speechless they be, and blind, and deaf,
17.
Nor in their mouths have breath.
18.
Like them the Makers are, and those
Who trust in Them repose.
19.
His praise, O ye from Jacob spring,
O house of Aaron sing!
20.
O house of Levi, who profess
His fear, your Maker bless.
21.
From Sion let your blessings sound,
Your thankful Songs abound:
Praise ye the Lord, His mercies tell,
Who does in Salem dwell.
PSALM. CXXXVI.
To the usual Tune. As Psalm 148.
1.
GIve thanks unto the Lord,
Who does all good afford;
2.
The God of Gods, who swaies
3.
Those Lords whom earth obeyes.
4.
Who has alone
Great wonders done:
His mercy sure
Does still endure.
5.
To Him who Heavens made,
6.
Earth 'bove the waters laid:
7.
To Him who formed great lights,
To rule our days and nights:
8.
The Sun at noone,
The Stars and Moon,
9.
Whose mercy sure
Does still endure.
10.
Who Egypts firstborn smote;
11. 12.
And Jacob from them brought.
13.
The Red Sea parted was,
14.
For Israel to pass.
15.
But Pharaoh's host
In it was lost.
His mercy sure
Does still endure.
16.
Who His through deserts led;
17 18.
Great Kings discomfited,
19
Sihon the Amorite;
20.
And Og, with Bashan's might;
21.
And gave their land
22.
To Jacob's hand:
His mercy sure
Does still endure.
23.
Who our low state esteemed,
24.
And from our foes redeemed:
25.
Who to all flesh gives food,
His creatures fills with good:
26.
Your thanks O bring
To Heavens King;
Whose mercy sure
Does still endure.
PSALM. CXXXVII.
Sing this as Psalm 119.
1.
BY Babylons swift streams we sat,
Sad and disconsolate;
The tears as fast ran from our ey,
For Sions memory.
2.
Our harps untuned, and unstrung,
Upon the Willowes hung;
3.
When those who did us captive bring,
Bid us (in scorn) to sing.
They, who us spoiled with sword and fire,
Did mirth of us require:
Sing us (said They) one of the Songs,
To Sion which belongs.
4.
But how shall we sing the Lords Song,
His Enemies among?
Or tune His Notes in strangers Land,
That cannot understand?
5.
O dear Jerusalem! when I
Forsake thy memory,
May my skill fail, my right hand let
Her cunning quite forget.
6.
Cleave to the roof O may my tongue,
When I not mourn thy wrong;
Or if I not prefer thy mirth
Above all joys on earth.
7.
In thy remembrance, Lord! retain
Proud Edoms fierce disdain;
Who against Jerusalem did cry,
Mocking her misery.
Now she is fallen, nere may our eyes
Again behold her rise!
Down with it, (their rude clamours sound,
Raze it even to the ground.
8.
O Babylon! which did us wast,
Thy self our woes must taste:
And in thy final ruin we
Sions revenge shall see.
Happy are They, who to requite
The measure of thy spite,
9.
Without all pity against the stones
Shall dash thy little ones.
PSALM. CXXXVIII.
1.
I Thee will praise with my whole heart,
My thankful hymns impart;
Before the Gods of Earth I Will sing
My praise to Heaven's King.
2.
I toward Thy Temple worship will,
And praises utter still:
Thy word and Name shall loudly sound,
Whose love, and truth abound.
3.
When in my plaints to Thee I cried,
Thy love as soon replied:
My fainting spirit was renewed,
With strength my soul endu'd.
4.
The Kings of earth Thy praise shall bear,
When they Thy words do hear:
5.
They in the ways of God shall sing
The glory of their King.
6.
For though the Lord be very high,
Yet He cast's down His eye;
The meek and lowly He respects,
But all the proud neglects.
7.
Though I in midst of trouble live,
Yet Thou will me revive:
Thy stretched out hand my wrathful foes
To ruin shall expose.
8.
The Lord my comforts will assure,
By mercyes which endure.
Cease not of me regard to take;
Nor Thine own works forsake.
PSALM. CXXXIX.
Sing this as Psalm 51.
1.
LOrd! thou have thoroughly searched me,
I open am, and known to Thee:
2.
My sitting down, and my up-rise
Are not concealed from Thine eyes:
Thou understand'st my distant thought,
Ere it to form my self had brought.
3.
Thou circlest in my path, and bed,
And have my ways discovered.
4.
Thou hear'st each whisper from my tongue,
And ere 'twas uttered, knew'st it long.
5
By Thee I fashioned, am and made,
Thy hand each part in order laid.
6.
Yet can I not the knowledge gain,
How I this being did attain;
Which does in wonder so excel,
It Is easier to admire, then tell.
7.
How shall I from Thy spirit fly?
Or Thy all present power deny?
8.
If I climb Heaven, it is Thine own Shere:
If stoop to Hell, lo, Thou art there.
9.
If borne upon the mornings wing,
Far as the Sea does swell, or spring;
10.
Thy Right hand shall protect and lead,
Where ere my weary footsteps tread.
11.
If I pretend the darkness shall
Upon me, like a covering, fall;
Those heavy fogs, those mists of night,
Will quickly clear, and turn to light.
12.
The thickest shade, or blackest cloud,
Can nothing from thy knowledge shrowed:
For darkness does like Noontide shine,
Light'ned by brighter beams of Thine.
13.
My reins are Thine: Thou made the womb
My bodies clothing to become.
14.
I will give thanks to Thee, O Lord,
Who was enlived by Thy word:
With awful art, and wondrous form
Thou did Thy workmanship adorn.
My soul Their marvels must confess,
And for Thy favors daily bless.
15.
Though I was fashioned in the dark,
Too secretly for man to mark,
There is no curious joint, or bone,
But was to Thy inspection known.
16.
Thou did upon my substance look,
And wrot'st each member in Thy book:
Thou saw how my imperfect frame
By daily growth to figure came.
17.
O Lord, how precious, O how dear
Thy purposes and thoughts appear!
18.
Which were they summed in my account,
They would the numerous sands surmount.
These wonders always present ly,
Fixed in my thankful memory:
And whilst of them surveies I take,
My contemplation still must wake.
19.
O God! Thou shall the wicked slay:
Ye bloody men depart away:
20.
For their foul tongues Thy honor stain,
And take Thy sacred Name in vain.
21.
Do not I hate, and grieve at those,
Whose proud despite against thee rose?
22.
With perfect hate I them despise,
Accounting them mine enemies.
23.
Search me (O Lord!) and prove my heart,
Who Judge of all my actions art:
Do Thou my faith to trial bring,
My hidden thoughts examining:
24.
Look well, and all my motions view,
If I persist in ways untrue:
And when Thou find'st my feet to stray,
Reduce me to Thy lasting way.
PSALM. CXL.
1.
SAve me from men to evil bent;
And from the violent:
2.
Which mischief in their hearts devise,
In war, and tumult rise.
3.
Their tongues are, like a Serpents, whet;
Their lips in poison set.
4.
Lord! keep me from the raging foe,
That would my feet orethrow.
5.
The proud have hidden nets prepared,
To take my life ensnared.
6.
But I, Thou art my God, have said;
O hear, and send me aid.
7.
O God my Lord! the strength alone
Of my salvation;
In day of battle Thou my head
Have safely covered.
8.
Grant not (O Lord!) their bad desire;
Least then their pride aspire.
9.
Let sudden mischief cover those,
Who would my life enclose.
10.
Let quenchless fire upon them rain;
Nor let them rise again:
11.
No violent man, nor evil tongue
On earth be stablish'd long.
12.
I know the Lord will them maintain,
Who have afflicted lay'n;
Their cause regards, and does delight
To help the poor to right.
13.
For this, unto Thy Name the just
Their thanks acknowledge must.
And those who live upright, and well,
Shall in Thy presence dwell.
PSALM. CXLI.
1.
TO Thee I cry, O Lord, make have
To hear my voice at last.
2.
Let my request like Incense rise,
Or evening sacrifice.
3.
Set Thou a watch my mouth before,
And keep my speeches door;
4.
Incline not unto ill my heart,
With sinners to take part.
Let me not eat of that delights
Their wicked appetites:
5.
But let the righteous me reprove,
And smite me in his love.
Like precious balmes, or odours shed,
Such strokes not break my head;
And in my prayers I shall them bless,
In midst of their distress.
6,
When wicked Judges overthrow'n
Ly dashed against the stone;
They shall with much contentment hear
My words, which comfort bear.
7.
Dispersed, and scattered on the grave,
Our bones no value have:
As fallen trees, cut down, and cleft,
Are in their splinters left.
8.
But though in darkness closed I ly,
On Thee I fix mine eye:
Thou will not leave me in the dust,
In whom my soul does trust.
9.
O keep me from the cruel net,
Which wicked men have set.
10.
Let them be snared in their own trap;
But let my soul escape.
PSALM. CXLII.
1.
WIth low'd-voic'd cries to God I came,
And my request did frame:
2.
I powered out my sad complaint,
And showed Him my restraint.
3.
Thou, when my soul was drowned in woe,
My way, and path did know:
Yet in that walk my feet did tread,
Close snares for me were spread.
4.
I did upon my right hand look,
But no man knowledge took:
My soul of help was quite bereft,
And had no refuge left.
5.
I therefore cried to Thee, O Lord!
And said this faithful word:
Thou do my Help and Portion stand,
In the Eternal Land.
6.
Consider then my great distress,
Brought low with heaviness.
From persecuters me defend,
Unable to contend.
7.
My soul out of the prison bring,
That I Thy praise may sing.
And for this bounty showed to me,
The just shall honor Thee.
PSALM. CXLIII.
As Psalm 25.
1.
O Lord my Prayer hear,
Presented in Thy fear:
With mercy answer my request,
In humblest words expressed.
2.
Weigh not in judgments scales
Thy servants daily fails;
For no man living, in Thine eye,
Himself shall justify.
3.
My foes which do pursue
My soul, by ways undue,
Make me in darkness hide my head,
Like those have long been dead.
4.
My Spirit faint, and worn,
Is by my griefs oreborne:
My heart within me desolate,
Through my dejected state.
5.
Yet I the days of old
In my remembrance hold:
Thy wonders past I meditate,
And all Thy works of late.
6.
To Thee I stretch my hands;
Like as the thirsty Lands
The fruitful raines desire to see,
So thirsts my soul for Thee.
7.
Hear me, O Lord, with speed;
My fainting spirit heed:
Least if Thou frown, I prove like those,
The pit of Death does close.
8.
O let my longing ear
Betimes Thy kindness hear.
In Thee I trust: reveal that Path,
Thy truth prescribed has.
9.
Lord save me from their spite,
Who in my wrongs delight:
To Thee my soul for shelter flies,
Against her enemies.
10.
Teach me to do Thy will,
That I may please Thee still:
Let Thy good spirit me direct,
To live with Thine elect.
11.
Lord quicken me again;
Cleanse Thou my sinful stain;
For Thy great Name, and justice sake,
My soul from trouble take.
12.
I am Thy servant, Lord!
My comfort is Thy word.
Then of Thy goodness those destroy,
Who in my sorrows joy.
PSALM. CXLIV.
1.
Blessed be the Lord, my strength, my might,
Who taught my hands to fight:
2.
My rock, my shield, and helper true,
My people to subdue.
3.
Lord! what is man? or what his race,
Thy notice should him grace?
4.
Who is so vain, his days do fade
Like to the passing shade.
5.
O Lord, the arched Heavens bow,
Come down to earth below.
Touch their proud tops, and then thy stroke
Shall make the mountains smoke.
6.
From Thy full clouds quick lightning cast,
And them by scattering wast;
Let Thy sharparrowes, against them shot,
Destruction make their lot.
7.
Send from above Thine hand, to save
Me from the swelling wave.
8.
From children strange, whose mouth speaks hate,
Whose right hand acts deceit.
9.
Then I new Songs will sing to Thee,
Upon the Psalterie:
And on the ten-string'd Instrument
Ditties of praise invent.
10.
For God salvation gives to Kings;
His help to David brings:
From peril of the Sword, and grave,
He does His servant save.
11.
Deliver me from strangers hands,
Whose mouth against Thee bands:
Whose right hand falsehood does defend;
Whose deeds in rapine end.
12.
Our Sons like plants then, fresh in growth,
Shall flourish in their youth:
Our daughters like fair columns be,
Which we in Temples see.
13.
Our garners shall be filled with store,
Our sheep bring thousands more,
14.
Our Oxen strong; nor shall restraint
Cause in our streets complaint.
15.
Happy that people, and that place,
Which is in such a case:
Yea blessed are, and happy, they,
Who God their Lord obey.
PSALM. CXLV.
Sing this as Psalm 100.
1.
I Thee extol, my God and King!
And of Thy Name for ever sing;
2.
I Thee will bless through all my days,
And yield Thy Name eternal praise.
3.
Great is the Lord, praised and admired,
His greatness is by none exquir'd.
4.
Each generation shall declare,
How mighty His achievements are.
5.
I will Thy glory celebrate,
Thy wondrous works Majestic State:
6.
Thy acts of terror, and of fame,
All men shall speak, and I proclaim.
7.
They shall abundantly profess
Thy goodness, and Thy righteousness;
8.
Whose grace, and full compassions flow,
To mercy swift, to anger slow.
9.
God's goodness every where extends,
His mercy all His works transcends.
10.
All things (O Lord) Thou did create;
And Saints Thy praise shall celebrate.
11.
Their tongues Thy Kingdom's rule make known;
By them Thy glorious acts are show'n:
12.
That all the Sons of men may see
Thy mighty power, and Majesty.
13.
Thy Kingdom does for ever last,
When men decay, and time is past.
14.
God does uphold all such as fall,
And men cast down from ruin call.
15.
The eyes of all on Thee attend,
Who in due season meat do send:
16.
Thy open hand, when need requires,
Does satisfy their just desires.
17.
The Lord is right in all His ways,
In Holiness His works He lays.
18.
The Lord is good, and nigh to all,
Who faithfully upon Him call.
19.
He their desire will satisfy,
Who fear Him, and regard their cry:
20.
Saves all, that love Him, from annoy:
But all the wicked will destroy.
21.
Therefore my mouth, to speak His praise,
Shall loud, and thankful accents raise:
And let all flesh, whom He did frame,
For ever bless His Holy Name.
PSALM. CXLVI.
1.
TTo God (my soul) His praises give,
And bless Him, whilst I live.
2.
I will to Him my thanks up send,
Until my being end.
3.
Put not in Princes any trust,
Nor in the Sons of dust;
Who nor themselves, nor others save
From the devouring grave.
4.
Soon as man breathless does remain,
He turns to earth again.
And, as his time of life expires,
So perish his desires.
5.
O therefore happy he, whose faith
On God relyance has:
Who makes the fear of Him his scope,
And object of his hope.
6.
He Heaven and earth and Sea did frame,
With all that Those contain:
And when their frame is quite defaced,
His truth shall ever last.
7.
He does the wronged help to right,
Who are oppressed by might:
Feeds those that are to want exposed;
And has the Captives loosed.
8.
He to the blind restores their eyes,
He makes the fallen to rise:
He upon such bestows his care,
Who just and faithful are.
9.
The Lord all strangers does receive,
And fatherless relieve:
When wicked men are overthrown,
And all their hopes cast down.
10.
The Lord thy God, O Sion, reigns,
His glory still remains.
Then to thy everlasting King
Eternal praises sing.
PSALM. CXLVII.
1.
PRaise ye the Lord: a pleasant thing
It is, His praise to sing.
2.
God ruined Salem does repair:
Whose outcasts gathered are.
3.
He heales and binds the broken heart,
Relieves the wounded's smart:
4.
The sparkling Stars He numbers all,
And by their names does call.
5.
Great is our Lord, and strong His might,
His Wisdom infinite:
6.
He does the meek exalt, and crown;
But cast's the wicked down.
7.
To God the Lord, so good, so great,
Your thankful hymns repeat;
And to the Harpes melodious string
His constant praises sing.
8.
Who heavens face with vapor shrowds,
And covers it with clouds:
Who powers his rain on earth below,
And makes the Mountains grow.
9.
He gives his food unto the beast;
And, from their airy nest
When the young ravens to Him cry,
Feeds Them abundantly.
10.
He not delights in strength of horse,
Nor values humane force:
11.
But those who make His fear their scope,
And in His mercy hope.
12.
Jerusalem O praise the Lord;
Sion, Thy God record:
13.
Who bars thy gates, to give thee rest,
And has thy children blessed.
14.
He makes in thy borders peace;
Fills thee with corns increase.
15.
His winged commands most swiftly run,
And, soon as said, are done.
16.
He gives, like the wool, his snowes,
Hoare frost like ashes strowes:
17.
Casts forth his Ice, like morsells rolled.
Who can withstand His cold?
18.
He sends out His word, and Law,
Which melts them to a thaw:
He causes His strong wind to blow,
And makes the waters flow.
19.
His word He does to Jacob show,
Makes him His judgment know.
And to his chosen Israel
He does His Statutes tell.
20.
He with no Nation so did deal,
Nor thus His Love reveal;
Who nor His judgments knew, nor word:
Therefore, Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM. CXLVIII.
To the proper Tune.
1.
PRaise God from Heaven high,
Who sits above the sky:
2.
Ye glorious Angels all,
Ye Hosts Celestial;
3.
Ye Sun and Moon,
Both Night and Noon,
Ye Stars of light
His praise recite.
4.
Praise Him ye Heavens that move,
Ye waters them above,
5.
Praise Him, whose powerful Name
Created This great frame.
He did command
6.
Them fast to stand:
By His decree
They lasting be.
7.
All that earth's bosom keeps,
Ye dragons, and all deepes:
8.
Fire, hail, the falling snow,
The furious winds that blow:
Storms that fulfill
His sacred will,
And serve His word,
Praise ye the Lord.
9.
Mountains, that touch the sky;
Ye Hills, which lower ly;
All trees that fruitful are,
The Cedars tall and fair:
10.
Beasts, which the field,
Or pastures yield;
Each creeping thing;
And bird of wing.
11.
Kings, which the earth do sway,
People, who them obey:
Princes of royal birth,
And Judges of the earth:
12.
Young men, and maids,
Old men, and babes,
13.
Let them proclaim
His awful name:
His Name does all excel,
In earth, or Heaven that dwell:
14
He will His People raise,
Of all His Saints the praise:
Even Jacob dear,
His care most near;
Joined in accord,
Praise ye the Lord.
PSALM. CXLIX.
Sing this as Psalm 119.
1.
PRaise ye the Lord: New Anthems bring,
Which ye to God may sing:
And let the quire of Saints His praise
In their assembly raise.
2.
Let Israel in Him rejoice,
Who formed him with his voice:
Let all the Sons, from Sion spring,
Be joyful in their King.
3.
Let them with Dance, and Pipe proclaim
The glory of His Name:
Let them sing praises with the Harp,
With Timbrell shrill and sharp.
4.
For in His people He delights,
Who celebrate His Rites:
And those with meekness who abound,
Are with salvation crowned.
5.
Let Saints with glory raise their heads,
And sing upon their beds:
6.
Let His high praise, who rules the skies,
Their voices exercise.
And in their hand a Two-edged sword
Be put, to act His word,
7.
For judgment against the Heathen bent,
And peoples punishment:
8.
Their captive Kings in chains confined,
With manacles to bind,
And their rebellious Nobles lead
In iron fettered.
9.
To execute that heavy wrath
His judgment threat'ned has:
And in fair Characters engrave;
His Saints such honor have.
PSALM. CL.
1.
PRaise ye the Lord, your Songs address
To praise His Holiness:
O praise Him in His powers extent,
Who rules the firmament.
2.
Praise Him for all His acts of might,
Our wonder which invite:
In praises due His greatness tell,
Which all things does excel.
3.
Praise Him with Trumpets lofty sound,
With Cornets shake the ground:
His praise the Psaltery inspire,
With the melodious Lyre.
4.
Praise him with Timbrells, and advance
His honor in the Dance.
Praise Him with Organs, Violls, Flutes,
And the well-stringed Lutes.
5.
With Cymbals loud Him magnify,
Praise Him on Cymbals high:
6.
Let every creature, that has breath,
His Maker praise till death.
FINIS.
The Lord's Prayer.
OUr Father which in Heaven ar't!
1.
Thy Name be Hallowed by each heart:
2.
Thy Kingdom come: Thy Will be done
3.
In earth as it is in Heaven thy throne:
4.
Give us this day our daily Bread,
That Souls and Bodies may be fed.
5.
Forgive our trespasses, as we
Forgive them, where we Trespassed be:
6.
To no Temptation lead our Will:
7.
But us Deliver from all ill:
For Thine the Kingdom and the Power
And Glory is, for evermore.
Amen.
The Creed.
1.
IN God the Father most of might
I do Believe aright,
Maker of Heaven and of Earth,
With all that there have birth:
2.
And Jesus Christ His only Son:
3.
Whose pure Conception
Did by the Holy Spirit come
Born in the Virgins womb.
4.
He under Pilate Crucified,
Suffered for us and Died,
Was buried, went to Hell beneath:
5.
The Third day Rose from death:
6.
He into Heaven did Ascend,
And sits at God's Right Hand:
7.
From thence He shall come down with dread
To Judge both quick and dead:
8.
I in the Holy Ghost believe:
9.
The Catholic Church receive,
The Saints in one Communion joined:
10.
That sins Forgiveness find:
11.
That these our Bodies from the Grave
A Resurrection have:
12.
And shall enjoy a Life of bliss,
Which Everlasting is. Amen.
The ten Commandments, Exodus 20.
GOd spoke these words: I am the Lord
Who Thee to Liberty restored,
And did from Aegypts bondage free:
1.
Thou shal't adore no God but Me.
2.
Thou shal't no Graven Image make,
Nor any other likeness take,
In Heaven, or Earth, or Seas below,
To which thou may fall down and Bow.
For, jealous of Mine honor, I
Unto the fourth posterity
Visit the children for the sin
Which has by Fathers acted been.
Yet I my Mercies heep in store
For thousand generations more
Of them that love Me, whose intents
Walk after My Commandments.
3.
Thou shall by Swearing not profane
Nor take Thy Makers Name in vain;
For God will no man guiltless deem,
Who does His Sacred Name blaspheme.
4.
Remember that to Rest and Pray
Thou holy keep the Sabbath Day:
Six days thou labor shal't, but This
The Lord thy God's high Sabbath is.
No kind of work shall then be done,
By Thee, thy daughter, or thy Son,
Nor Servants, Cattle, nor the late
Admitted stranger to thy Gate.
For God in six days all things made,
And Resting on the Seventh stayed,
The Sabbath day He therefore blessed,
And Hallowed it for public Rest.
5.
Honor thy Parents, and obey
What just commands so-ere They lay,
That in the Land Thou long may live,
Which God does for Thy dwelling give.
6.
From Bloody acts and Murder fly.
7.
Commit no soul Adultery.
8.
Thou shall't not Steal. Nor any where
9.
False witness against thy Neighbor bear:
10.
Thou shall't not (moved by lust or strife)
Covet thy Neighbors House or Wife,
Nor Man, nor Maid, nor Ox of His,
Nor what to Him belonging is.
O Lord have mercy, and incline
Our Minds to keep These Laws of Thine:
Write Thy Commandments in our heart,
That we from Them may never depart.
Amen.
Veni Creator.
COme Holy Ghost Thy Power dilate,
Which all things did create:
With Heavenly Grace and pure desire,
Thy servants hearts inspire.
Thou ar't the Paraclete, the spring
Which does all comforts bring,
The Life, the Light, the Fire of Love,
And Unction from above.
Thou do Thy Sev'nfold Gifts bestow,
That we Thy Truth may know,
The Finger ar't of God's Right Hand,
The Key to understand:
Thou His long promised Blessing ar't,
To glad each drooping Heart,
Who do enrich us with Thy word,
And Utterance afford.
O let Thy Light into us shine,
Infuse Thy Love Divine,
Our minds with strengthening Grace supply,
To suffer constantly:
Our enemies assaults repel,
That we in Peace may dwell,
And guide us with Thy Mighty Arm,
We may avoid all harm.
Teach us the Father to Believe,
And Christ the Son receive,
With God the Holy Ghost, who does
Proceed alike from Both:
To this Eternal Trinitee,
All Praise and Glory be;
And pray we Their Blessed Spirit may
With us for ever stay.
Amen.
Te Deum.
WE Praise Thee God! we daily bless,
And Thee the Lord confess:
Father from all Eternitee,
The Earth does worship Thee.
To Thee all Angels lowdly cry,
The Heavens and Powers on high,
To Thee Cherubs and Seraphims
Sing their incessant Hymns.
O Holy Holy Holy Lord!
Thou God of Hosts adored!
Thy Majesty and Glory still
Both Earth and Heaven fill.
Thee the Apostles Glorious Quire,
The Prophets Thee admire,
The Martyrs noble Army raise
Blessed Anthemes in thy praise.
The Holy Church does knowledge Thee
Father of Majestee,
Thy true and only Son, the great
Most Holy-Paraclet.
Thou ar't O Christ of glory King,
The Father Equalling;
Yet didd'st not, when to save us come,
Disdain the Virgins womb.
When Thou the sharpness of Deaths sting
Ov'rcam'st by suffering,
Heavens opened Kingdom thou didd'st give
To All that Thee Believe:
Thou sitt'st at God's right Hand, from whom
Thou will it to Judge us Come,
Accomplish then Thy Servants good,
Bought with thy Precious Blood.
Amongst Thy Saints in glory Crowned,
Let them be numbered found;
Lord save Thy People from mischance,
Bless Thine inheritance,
Govern, and lift Them up to bliss,
Which true and endless is:
We day by day extol Thy fame,
Still worshipping Thy Name.
Vouchsafe this day which now begins,
To keep us without Sins.
Have mercy upon us O Lord!
Thy helping Grace afford.
Lord! as our hopes on Thee depend,
Thy mercy on us send.
O Lord in Thee I trusted have,
Me from Confusion save.
Benedictus. Luc. 1. v. 68.
THe God of Israel be blessed,
His people who releast,
And has by One Salvation wrought,
From David's lineage brought.
As He by all His Prophets said,
Ere since the world was made,
That from our foes we should be saved,
Whose hatred us enslaved.
His promised mercy to perform,
To Abraham first sworn,
The Oath and holy Covenant
Which He to us would grant;
That we who now delivered were,
Might serve Him without fear,
In holiness and righteous ways,
Before him all our days.
And Thou, O Child, of Gods decree,
Shall called the Prophet be,
For Thou must go before His face,
Sent to prepare His place:
Unto His People in His Name,
Salvation to proclaim;
And to the Souls perplexed within,
Remission of their sin.
Through Gods most tender love, whose eye,
Did visit us from high,
And caused his Morning Star to shine,
Diffusing beams Divine,
To lighten those in darkness laid,
By Deaths unhappy shade,
And guide our feet which knew no ease,
Into the ways of Peace.
Magnificat. Luc. 1. v. 46.
MY soul does magnify the Lord,
My Spirit does record,
In her rejoicing Songs, the Power
Of God my Savior.
For He regarded has of late
His Handmaids low estate,
Behold all generations shall
Henceforth Me Blessed call.
For He great things for me has done,
Blessed be His Name alone;
His Mercies through all Times appear,
To those which Him do fear.
He with His Arm much strength has showed
To scatter all the proud,
He puts the Mighty from their seat,
And makes the humble great.
The hungry He has filled with food,
And given them all things good:
But He the rich whom pleasures sway,
Has empty sent away.
His mercy He remembered has,
To help his Servants faith,
As He to Abraham decreed,
And His elected Seed.
Nunc Dimittis, Luc. 2. v. 29.
NOw let Thou Thy servant, Lord,
According to Thy word,
Depart in peace; For now mine eyes
See Thy Salvation rise;
Which Thou prepar'dst in all men's sight,
To be the Gentiles Light,
And crown with glories which excel
Thy people Israel.
A Penitential Hymn.
HEarken O God! unto a wretches cries,
Who low dejected at thy footstool lies:
Let not the clamor of my heinous sin
Drown my requests, which strive to enter in
At those bright Gates, which always open stand
To such as beg remission at thy hand.
Too well I know, if Thou in justice deal,
I can nor pardon ask nor yet appeal.
To my hoarse voice heaven will no audi'ence grant,
But deaf as brass, and hard as Adamant,
Beat back my words: Therefore I bring to Thee,
A gracious Advocate to plead for me.
What though my leprous soul no Jordan can
Recure? nor floods of the lav'd ocean
Make clean? yet from my Saviors bleeding side
Two large and med'cinable rivers glide.
Lord wash me where those springs of life abound
And new Bethesdaes flow from every wound.
If I this precious Lather may obtain,
I shall not then despair for any stain:
I need no Gilead's Balm, nor Oil, nor shall
I for the purifying Hysop call:
My spots will vanish in His purple flood,
And Crimson there grow White, though washed in Blood.
See Lord! with broken heart and bended knee,
How I address my humble Suit to Thee:
O give that suit admittance to thine ears,
which floats to thee, not in my words but tears
And let my sinful Soul this mercy crave,
Before I fall into the silent grave.
The Lords Prayer.
