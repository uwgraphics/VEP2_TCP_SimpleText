THe continual new Buildings, and addition and increase of Buildings in and
near about the City of London is grown to that excess, and does draw
together such an ouerflow of people, specially of the meaner sort, as can
hardly be either sed and sustained, or preserved in health or governed, which
does not only threaten, but has already bred and brought forth at diverse
times dearth of Victuals, infection of Plague, and minifold disorders, which
his Majesty in his Royal wisdom before this time foreseeing, has since his
happy coming to the Crown, by two several Proclamations, The one in the
second year of his highness Reign concerning building with Brick, the other
in the fifth year of his Reign concerning building upon New foundations,
(wherein nevertheless the former ordinance touching Brick buildings is
continued) sought to give remedy and provision for the same; But such has been
and is the covetous desire of gain and private benefit arising of such
Buildings, joined with a neglect of Justices and Officers in executing his
Majesty's said Proclamations, as many persons have presumed and adventured to
offend against them, both to the continuance and increase of the former evils
and inconveniences, and to the manisest ill example of contempt and
disobedience in a case so notorious, and in the view of the whole kingdom: His
Majesty nevertheless not forgetting (though upon so just cause of
indignation) his accustomed clemency, has thought good to make a difference
between the offenders and their cases, and for such as have offended in not
building with Brick, in as much as the offenders were in great multitude, and
might have some color of necessity, or pretended impossibility, though
unjustly, as themselves must needs confess, if they look abroad, and see what
is done in other well polliced Cities of Europe, His highness gave order that
after some exemplar censure of a few Offenders by sentence in the Star Chamber,
the residue should be admitted to composition, according to his Majesty's
Commission of grace for that purpose granted, wherein his Majesty's express
pleasure was, That the Fines should be so mild and moderate as might make the
Offenders themselves sensible of his Majesty's Ienitie and gracious
disposition, and might make all others perceive, That it was not his Majesty's
profit that was sought, but only the repressing of the inconvenience, and the
preserving of the authority of his Majesty's Royal commandments for the
public good, from contempt. But for the second for of offenders, which have
erected new foundations where no Buildings were before, which had no manner of
circumstance to extenuate their offense, but many to aggrauate the same, being
against a Proclamation so lately published, and so straightly penned, and
immediately after a seucre sentence in the Star Chamber, his Majesty has
directed that all such Offenders, (the number of which cannot be many being
within the compass of one year) shall be proceeded within in the Star Chamber.
But as his Majesty does not think fit to admit at all to grace that kind of
Offenders, so his Highness does publish and declare, That for the other point
of Brick building, no man do hereafter expect any the like favor of
Composition, as his Majesty was pleased only at this time for the avoiding of
rigor and extremity to grant and extend: But his Majesty's will and pleasure
is, That his said ordinance be hereafter straightly observed, and maintained, and
the offenders against the same with all severity punished. And to the end to
remove and take away all color of pretended necessity in that point, His
Majesty is graciously pleased that his former Proclamations be explained and
qualified in manner and form following, That is to say, That if any person that
shall hereafter erect any building upon ad old foundation within the precincts
limited in the Proclamation published in the fifth year of his Highness
reign, shall make it appear, That either the quantity of the ground whereupon
the old Foundation stands, is of too small a proportion to receive a Brick
building, or that the house is situate in so obscure or mean a Lane of Alley,
as is not fit for such a Building, or that the trade of such person as
intends such building, is the trade of a retayling shopkeeper, and of such a
nature as his shop and building cannot with any conuenience be built with
Brick, and thereupon shall obtain certificate under the hands of the Lord
Mayor, the Recorder, and the Alderman of the Ward, if the building be within
the City or the Liberties thereof, and under the hands of two Justices of the
Peace, whereof one to be of the Quorum, if it be out of the City and Liberties,
And shall further upon the said Certificate, procure a License under the hands
of any four of his Majesty's Privy Council, whereof the Lord Chancellor,
Lord Treasourer, Lord privy Scale, and Chancellor of the Exchequer for the
time being, to be two in allowance of the same, That in such case such person
so building, shall not be deemed and taken for an offender against his
Majesty's Proclamations, any thing in the said Proclamations, or either of them
to the contrary hereof in any wise notwithstanding.

Given at our Manor of Tuddington the 25. day of July in the sixth year of
our Reign of Great Britain, France and Ireland.
Imprinted at London by the Deputies of Robert Barker, Printer to the Kings
most Excellent Majesty. Anno 1608.
