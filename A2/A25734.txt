blood For the glory of the King and the Parliaments good.

ROws;e up your drooping spirits all,
and listen to my story,
We have a noble General,
to stand for Englands glory.
Let us not be afraid to fight,
It Is for our King and Countries right.
Then hey for Essex,
The Earl of Essex,
We Will march with Essex,
down with the Cavelleers now boys.
The Cavalleers it seems are bent
I pray mark well my story,
To rainate our Parliament,
which stands for Englands glory,
But we will quell their haughty pride,
And send them to old Nick their guide.
Then hey for Essex,
The Earl of Essex,
We Will march with Essex,
down with the Cavalleers now boys.
Brave London lads I understand,
I pray mark well my story,
Protest to set their help in hand,
and fight for Englands glory,
O we will march courageously,
Against the Gospels enemy.
Then hey, etc.
The Prentices have proved men,
I pray mark well my story,
At Bulloigne wars, take notice then,
they stood for Englands glory.
Though they lie sleeping in the grave,
Ten thousand of their breed we have
To go with Essex,
The Earl of Essex,
We Will march with Essex,
down with the Cavalleers now boys.
The Glovers and the Butchers bold,
I pray mark well my story,
The Feltmakers you may behold,
do stand for Englands glory.
The Dyers will their cunning try
Some other colors for to dye,
Then hey for Essex,
The Earl of Essex,
We Will march with Essex,
down with the Cavalleers now boys.
When Crispianus was a lad,
I pray mark well my story,
You read how he good fortunes had,
he stood for Englands glory.
This puts the Shoomakers in mind,
They may the like succession find.
Then hey, etc.
The second Part.
To the same Tune.


ALL kinds of Tradesmen more and less,
I pray mark well my story,
Their voluntary minds express,
they will stand for Englands glory,
All such as does the truth oppose,
We Will lay them on with manly blows.
Then hey for Essex,
The Earl of Essex,
We Will march with Essex,
down with the Cavalleers now boys.
Cheer up my lively hearts of gold,
and listen to my story,
The Cavalleers shall be controlled,
by us for Englands glory,
To go with this renowned Earl,
Each Lad has vowed to leave his Girl,
Then hey for Essex,
Warlike Essex,
We Will march with Essex,
down with the Cavalleers now boys.
Alas the Maids are discontent,
I pray mark well my story,
To see their loves so warlike bent,
to stand for Englands glory.
In heart they wish that they were men,
Only to march along with them,
And noble Essex, etc.
You masters that do want your men,
I pray marks well my story,
You ought to speak no ill of them,
that stand for Englands glory.
But pray for us when we are gone,
We go to keep you safe at home,
With warlike Essex,
The Earl of Essex,
We Will march with Essex,
down with the Cavalleers now boys.
Mars and Bellona does us greet,
I pray mark well my story,
With invitations very meet,
to stand for Englands glory,
Now Mars commands we must obey,
Guns, Drums and Trumpets bravely play,
Then hey, etc.
Lord bless our King and Parliament,
and se I Will end my story,
We Will fight till life and breath be spent,
for them and Englands glory,
Lord be our guide, and prosper us,
For we are all resolved thus,
To go with Essex, etc.
