A Scotch Song written and compes'd by Mr Richard Brown.
^ If my Sawny thou's but love me,
^ Ise be constant, Ise be kind:
^ No gued Lass shall er'e out do me,
^ nor blithe Lad once change my mind.
^ Ise Trudg with thee,
^ never leave thee,
^ gang thee er'e to wake or Fair.
^ Jenny'l peddle,
^ Sawny'l fiddle, fiddle,
^ sing and dance;
^ take our Chance,
^ laugh, drink, and Drown the Worlds Care.
(II.)
Wee's get Treasure in our Budget,
What tho Gold we do not wear;
Those that do, we never will grudg it,
We's get muckle Coin never fear:
With our Labor,
Pipe and Tabor;
We's play on each new born Year:
Jenny'l peddle,
Sawny'l fiddle,
Sing and dance;
Take our Chance,
Laugh, drink, and drown the Worlds Care.
For the Flute. ^
