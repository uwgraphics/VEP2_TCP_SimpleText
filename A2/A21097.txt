MADRIGALES TO 3. 4. and 5. parts: apt for Viols and voices.

Newly composed by Michaell Este.

IN LONDON PRINTED BY THOMAS ESTE.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL and my very good friend: Sir John Crofts Knight.
Michaell Este wishes long life, health and happiness, with increase of honor.
Worshipful Sir: having drawn together these Compositions, and therewith
acquainted some of my wel-willers, studious and skilful in the most delectable
Science, it pleased them not only with sweet words friendly to approve what I
had done, and t'incourage me boldly to goe-on in my course of studies, but
also with many arguments earnestly to importune me to publish for a common
benefit, which my self had done for my own recreation and private exercise.
Thus whet-on I did consent, and do present unto your worship these Musical
inventions of mine, not as did the Philosopher his book of Justice unto
Antigonus, that delighted in oppression (an unmeet Patron for so sweet and
necessary a subject); but as to one addicted to the Muses studious of all good
Sciences, excelling in virtue; delighting in Music; with-all, desiring your
Protection and Pardon: Protection of these my labors, the first fruits of my
weak studies against deprauers; Pardon for publishing them so boldly under
your worships name: which if I find (whereof I doubt not) then shall I be
encouraged with more alacrity, both to proceed as I have now begun, and to
prepare my self to some greater task. And so I humbly take my leave, wishing
all manner good, both unto your worship, and all yours.

Yours in all love and duty, Michaell Este.

TO THE RIGHT WORSHIPFUL and my very good friend: Sir John Crofts Knight.
Michaell Este wishes long life, health and happiness, with increase of honor.
Worshipful Sir: having drawn together these Compositions, and therewith
acquainted some of my wel-willers, studious and skilful in the most delectable
Science, it pleased them not only with sweet words friendly to approve what I
had done, and t'incourage me boldly to goe-on in my course of studies, but
also with many arguments earnestly to importune me to publish for a common
benefit, which my self had done for my own recreation and private exercise.
Thus whet-on I did consent, and do present unto your worship these Musical
inventions of mine, not as did the Philosopher his book of Justice unto
Antigonus, that delighted in oppression (an unmeet Patron for so sweet and
necessary a subject); but as to one addicted to the Muses* studious of all
good Sciences, excelling in virtue; delighting in Music; with-all, desiring
your Protection and Pardon: Protection of these my labors, the first fruits of
my weak studies against deprauers; Pardon for publishing them so boldly under
your worships name: which if I find (whereof I doubt not) then shall I be
encouraged with more alacrity, both to proceed as I have now begun, and to
prepare my self to some greater task. And so I humbly take my leave, wishing
all manner good, both unto your worship, and all yours.
